00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,370
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,190
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,060
Hey! What're you doing?!

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,060
It's because you're pestering me!

23
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,370
Like I said, just join us!

24
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,500
This is exactly what
I mean by pestering me!

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,720
It's fun to be a pirate!

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,450
I've had enough!
Just rest in there for a while!

27
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,160
Hmm?

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,680
Your injuries actually
aren't that light, either.

29
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,370
Geez... What's his problem?

30
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,500
Huh?

31
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,390
Why?!

32
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,750
Wait!

33
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,000
What is this guy?!
When did he steal the key?!

34
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,670
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

35
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,860
Wait!

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,060
This smell is...

37
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,850
Huh?

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
Wapol!

39
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,100
"Hiriluk's Cherry Blossoms
And The Will That Gets Carried On!"

40
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,770
When he found out that
Hiriluk had only 10 days to live,

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,960
Chopper got quite upset.

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,740
Well, that was only natural.

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,350
But he took action in his own way...

44
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,310
I'm gonna... die...

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,240
I will make cherry blossoms
bloom in this country!

46
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,410
This is a symbol of the belief
that nothing is impossible!

47
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,160
A lot of guards have been
absent recently. What's going on?

48
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,800
Well... they're out picking mushrooms
at the request of the Twenty MDs.

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,120
Mushrooms?

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,900
They said there's some mushroom
that can cure anything...

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,920
Mushroom?

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,560
Ah!

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,140
Hmm?

54
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,280
Idiot! They'll see us!

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,730
Doctor, about what they said...

56
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,300
I will never shoot you!

57
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,640
Don't ever come back here!

58
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,290
I did a terrible thing to you...

59
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,740
At least see my cherry blossoms.

60
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,680
They'll be my last big work.

61
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,330
Well... here we go again!

62
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,260
Dammit! I don't have much time left!

63
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,950
Nothing is impossible for the man
who raised a flag with a skull!

64
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,420
That's what I told you, right?!

65
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,520
I will fight!

66
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,860
Just like pirates do!

67
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,780
I found it! The Amiudake mushroom...

68
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,110
That's the one!

69
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,210
But...

70
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,700
how can I get across?

71
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,310
Dammit!

72
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm close... I'm so close!

73
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,670
Doctor...

74
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,490
I'm sorry... I lost...
one of your precious books...

75
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,260
What... happened to you?

76
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,180
Mushroom...

77
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,810
Medicine...

78
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,140
That's an Amiudake mushroom!

79
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,680
You... got it for me?

80
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,790
Please live... Please live, Doctor...

81
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,640
I wanna be a doctor.
Please teach me how to be a doctor.

82
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,370
I'll fight, too... just like pirates do!

83
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,790
Do you think a reindeer
can become one, too?

84
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,530
You can! You can!

85
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,560
You can! You can be a great doctor...

86
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,370
Doct- I can't breath...

87
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,080
because you have such a kind heart...

88
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,540
You idiot!

89
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,360
Chess! Kuromarimo!

90
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,070
Is the doctor hunt going well?!

91
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,690
Yes sir. Most of the doctors
have already been exiled.

92
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,780
Most?

93
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,040
There are two that
we haven't captured yet.

94
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,410
That Dr. Kureha and...

95
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,870
the quack, Hiriluk.

96
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,340
What'd you say?!

97
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,120
Oh, yeah! I've come up with a good idea!

98
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,640
--Hmm?
--Hmm?

99
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:58,870
Send an official notice to the citizens.
The Twenty MDs have all... fallen ill...

100
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,930
Does the Amiudake mushroom soup...
taste good?

101
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,440
Ahhh! Darn, this tastes terrible!

102
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,950
What?!

103
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,460
This isn't something that
any living thing can eat!

104
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,330
Oh no...

105
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,940
Don't be so down.
Good medicine doesn't taste good.

106
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,960
This means it's working.

107
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,280
Thank you, Chopper.

108
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,320
Huh?!

109
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,080
Hmm?

110
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,340
Huh?

111
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
What's that?

112
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,300
I did it...

113
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,120
What?

114
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,640
I finally did it... This is it!

115
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,290
This reaction... I've waited
for it for 30 years...

116
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,030
I did it, Chopper!
My research succeeded!

117
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,410
I wasn't wrong! I wasn't! I wasn't!

118
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:17,700
I can now make cherry blossoms
bloom on this winter island!

119
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,600
Listen. I'm going out,
but you stay put and rest here.

120
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,470
Okay.

121
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,380
See you later!

122
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,540
Doctor was happy...

123
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,140
I cured a human's disease!

124
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,610
Hmm?

125
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,280
You'll be able to become
a good doctor. I'll guarantee it.

126
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,710
Do you know... that the entire
country is a madhouse right now?

127
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,420
Yeah, I know.

128
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,010
About the Twenty MDs falling ill,
right? Ridiculous!

129
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,860
So what brought you here today?

130
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,120
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

131
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,600
Ahh, I refuse.

132
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,810
I haven't asked anything yet!

133
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,500
What's this dust?

134
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,940
That's my 30 years.

135
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,560
That's the medical science
that I've finally completed!

136
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,570
It's an all-purpose medicine that can
cure the country's sickness of the heart.

137
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,090
You've lived 30 fruitless years.
Good work.

138
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,030
So, why are you showing it to me?

139
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,920
There isn't enough dust.
I don't have much time left, either.

140
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,500
I want you to make cherry
blossoms bloom in my place.

141
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,740
Ridiculous! Why do I have to-

142
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,750
And one more thing!

143
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,960
Please teach medical science to Chopper.

144
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,420
He wants to become a doctor.

145
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,650
That's enough!

146
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,120
--He's a reindeer and monster,
but he'll certainly become a good doctor!

147
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,130
--Why would I...
--He's a reindeer and monster,
but he'll certainly become a good doctor!

148
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,510
He's a nice guy with a kind heart.

149
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,820
He risked his life
to make medicine for me!

150
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,110
Please! Help him become a doctor!

151
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,690
What nerve you have!

152
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,980
You want me to take care of your
stupid research and strange pet?!

153
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,000
You should know that I'm not someone
who'll sympathize with a man

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,610
just because he's not long for this world!

155
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,500
Get out of here!

156
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,390
Yeah... I know...
We've known each other a long time.

157
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,040
I'm counting on you...

158
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,060
It's not like you, Hiriluk...
throwing in the towel already...

159
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,030
I don't have much time left...

160
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,070
That idiot! He wouldn't!

161
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,610
What do you mean?!

162
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,370
The Twenty MDs fell ill!

163
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,760
Who'll treat this country's sick people?!

164
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,200
At least give us access to medicine!

165
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,330
Talking to us won't do anything!

166
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:50,860
--Even doctors get sick!

167
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,960
--Out of my way!
--Even doctors get sick!

168
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,500
--Out of my way!
--Ahh! Hiriluk?!

169
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,880
--Out of my way! Out of my way!
--Ahh! Hiriluk?!

170
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,090
That bastard is crazy!

171
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,360
Take the ropeway out.

172
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,340
Take me to the castle.

173
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,500
Where's Hiriluk?!

174
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,580
You don't have to run away!
I know about you!

175
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,310
I'm asking you where the quack went!

176
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,270
D-Doctor got better
so he went to the town...

177
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,640
Got better? He doesn't get better.

178
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,810
He can't be cured with
the current medical science.

179
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,740
That's not true! Look at this!

180
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,950
He's fine now because he ate this!

181
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,660
That's... an Amiudake mushroom!

182
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,050
This is an all-purpose medicine!
So he's fine now!

183
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,120
Doctor said that he felt
full of energy, too!

184
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,870
I will learn to be a doctor from Doctor.

185
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,010
What was that for?!

186
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,930
You stupid reindeer!

187
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,540
That mushroom is...

188
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,150
That mushroom is...

189
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,360
extremely poisonous!

190
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,720
Once you eat it, you'll be
dead within half a day!

191
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,320
What?

192
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,460
That's why that idiot...

193
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,290
That can't be true.
I looked it up in a book...

194
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,590
though I lost that book...

195
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,300
It's a mushroom that can defeat diseases!

196
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,980
That's why I raised this skull
towards all the diseases!

197
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,760
That's right! There was a skull right
next to the Amiudake mushroom picture!

198
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,770
Doctor also said he got better!

199
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,060
There's no way he'll die! You're a liar!

200
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,080
Paddle faster! Hurry up!

201
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,610
Seconds count!

202
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,270
He was happy about your thoughts.

203
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,460
The skull in the book indicates poison.

204
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,200
That's a lie!

205
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,240
That's not a lie! Remember it!

206
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,150
There's no medicine that can work
for all diseases in this world.

207
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,210
That's why doctors exist!

208
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,090
That's not true!

209
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,630
Listen. You can't save people
just by being kind!

210
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,380
If you want to save them, then
learn medical knowledge and skills!

211
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,840
Without skill, you can't save anyone!

212
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,230
You idiot...

213
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,430
Wapol-sama! Hiriluk is
heading to this castle!

214
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,620
So he got tricked!

215
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,500
What an idiot!

216
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,420
Is he serious? Why? What for?

217
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,170
He'll no longer come back to this house.

218
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,840
Looks like he decided the
castle is his graveyard...

219
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,810
Take me to the patients!
I came to save the Twenty MDs!

220
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,710
What?

221
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,760
What an idiot! You still don't get it?!

222
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,000
It was a trap! As you can see,
the Twenty MDs are just fine!

223
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,910
You came here to die, Dr. Hiriluk...

224
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,540
Why did he come here?

225
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,290
Guards, ready...

226
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,430
So that was all...

227
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,220
Good... So none of them are sick?

228
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,590
I was convinced...
that this was a national crisis...

229
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,860
So it was just a trick...

230
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,790
Humph! If it was really a national crisis,
I wouldn't want someone like you!

231
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,870
Pay no attention. Execute him!

232
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,950
Don't bother. You guys can't kill me.

233
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,790
Huh?

234
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,790
Hey... when do you think a person dies?

235
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,820
When a bullet from a
pistol pierces his heart?

236
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,180
No... When he's attacked
by an incurable disease?

237
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,430
No... When he eats a deadly
poisonous mushroom soup?

238
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,230
No!

239
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,650
A man dies when people forget him...

240
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,730
Even if I disappear,
my dream will come true.

241
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,780
The citizens' sickness of the
heart will be cured as well...

242
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,990
Why're you crying... Dalton-kun?

243
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,460
I wonder... if it's the same for a country...

244
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,420
Yeah, if there's someone
to pass it on to...

245
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,630
Hey hey, Dalton! What're you crying for?

246
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:04,120
Soon a monster will come here.
He's my son. Don't hurt him.

247
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,380
Don't worry, Chopper.
Your mushroom can't kill me.

248
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,700
I had... such a good life!

249
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,700
Good-bye, quack...

250
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,780
Thank you, Chopper!

251
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:07,100
He blew himself up! What an idiot!

252
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,990
Ahh!

253
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,000
What's that?!

254
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,020
It's a monster!

255
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,710
Shoot him! Shoot him!

256
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,300
Ahhh!

257
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,240
Wait!

258
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,390
Leave... Leave here!

259
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,420
When you can't even defeat me...

260
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,330
you can't possibly defeat them!

261
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,740
For laughing at
Hiriluk's death, I apologize!

262
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,700
Without enough power,
you'll just die in vain...

263
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,520
Don't sacrifice yourselves
any longer for this country...

264
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,920
Please...

265
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,710
Huh?

266
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,750
You let him get away, Dalton.

267
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,530
Shut up! You still don't get it?

268
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,330
The only man who tried to save
this sick country has just died.

269
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,670
When everyone gave up and despaired,

270
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,210
a kind doctor who tried
to save this country died!

271
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,250
So what if someone like that dies?

272
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,300
I saw the path that this country
should take. It should die out.

273
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,710
As long as we stay here,
it can't be rebuilt because....

274
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,540
even if medical care progresses...

275
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,620
even if the research
on medicine continues...

276
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,710
there's no medicine that can cure fools!

277
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,300
I let you have your say...
You made me really angry!

278
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,100
Please... please teach me to be a doctor!

279
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,900
Please... teach me to be a doctor!
I'll become the all-purpose medicine!

280
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,880
I'll become a doctor who can cure
anything! I'll cure even a country!

281
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,070
Because... Because... there's no disease
in this world that can't be cured!

282
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,220
Call me... Doctorine.

283
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,940
I won't... die...

284
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,320
I will carry on his will...

285
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,450
So for the 6 years since then...
Tony-kun has been studying under you...

286
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,700
Yeah... I taught him everything I know...

287
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,860
Doctorine! Doctorine!

288
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,490
Ahh! That bastard!

289
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,780
I've finally returned!

290
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,040
That annoying mouth!

291
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,830
Now, we're restoring the Drum Kingdom!

292
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,290
Doctorine! There's a problem!

293
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,590
Wapol is back!

294
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,050
Is that so...

295
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,160
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

296
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

297
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

298
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:57,320
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

299
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

300
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,410
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

301
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

302
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,010
I won't hit you, so leave this country!

303
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,050
It's no use, Chopper.
You think he'll just listen to you?

304
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,520
Wapol! You don't know what this flag
means because you were fake pirates!

305
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,730
The skull is a mark of faith!

306
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,650
"Vs. Wapol's Corps!
The Power of the Munch Munch Fruit!"

308
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
