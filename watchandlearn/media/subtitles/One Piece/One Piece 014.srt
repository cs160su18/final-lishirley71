2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,690
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,960
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,350
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,820
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:24,650
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,490
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,200
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,890
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,200
These are just in the way.

25
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,340
There it is...

26
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,500
"Cat Burglar"...

27
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,310
I'm not that great at the
One-Sword Style, but...

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Let's go, Butchie!

29
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,690
Okay! Let's do it, Siam!

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,280
Damn it! If I just had another sword!

31
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,250
If I can just get Zoro his swords...

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,100
What do you need swords for?

33
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,050
"Luffy, Back in Action!
Miss Kaya's Desperate Resistance"

34
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,450
To think that these brats
have held you back...

35
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,440
How the Black Cat Pirates have fallen...

36
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,860
Right... Jango?!

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:03,020
B-B-But... you said letting that kid
go wouldn't cause any problems!

38
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,960
Yes, I did say that.

39
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,860
But so what? We knew he was
going to try to stand up to us.

40
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,720
The only thing I didn't count on...

41
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,100
...was you guys' feebleness!

42
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,140
U-Us, feeble?

43
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Who're you calling feeble?!

44
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,110
Watch what you say, Captain Kuro!

45
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,100
Yeah, you were strong before!

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,820
But that was three years ago!

47
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,630
It's not like we partied while you
lived the easy life in this village!

48
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,750
'As right! We've attacked lotsa
towns and sunk lotsa pirates!

49
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,460
Your point being...

50
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,440
You've done nothing for three years!

51
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,760
There's no way you can beat
the Meowban Brothers of today!

52
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,800
S-Stop! Butchie! Siam!

53
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,620
You're not our captain anymore!

54
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,390
Sorry, but we're gonna kill ya!

55
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,020
W-When did he get behind them?!
And those weapons...

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,020
Who...

57
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,400
Who are you going to kill?!

58
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,590
He snuck...

59
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,980
...behind us!

60
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,740
Eh?!

61
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,960
He's gone!

62
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,440
There it is! The Pussy Foot Maneuver...

63
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,910
Pussy Foot Maneuver?

64
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,910
You're right.

65
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,980
I do feel a bit of sluggishness.

66
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,270
He's handling them like kids,

67
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,540
after they had the upper hand
against Zoro and his one sword!

68
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,390
That man's "Pussy Foot Maneuver"
is a silent movement technique.

69
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,000
Even a group of 50 assassins would
be killed before sensing him!

70
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,110
There's no way we can escape his plan!

71
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,020
And I got chills after seeing that
habit of his again three years after!

72
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,920
His odd way of lifting his glasses
to avoid cutting his own face

73
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,390
with those Cat Claws...

74
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,520
Clear proof that he hasn't
forgotten how to fight!

75
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,650
It seems I've grown
a bit good-natured myself,

76
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,510
during my last three years on dry land...

77
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,310
I'll give you five minutes.

78
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,460
If you can't take care of
things here in five minutes...

79
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,100
...then I'll kill every last one of you...

80
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,100
...with my own two hands!

81
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,290
Five minutes...

82
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,710
Five minutes should be enough!

83
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:15,000
H-Him! If we just beat him,
we can get past this hill!

84
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,950
We had the upper hand
against him just now!

85
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,080
We'll cut him up in five minutes!

86
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,330
We're counting on you,
Meowban Brothers!

87
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,100
Zoro!

88
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,240
What?!

89
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,140
H-Hey, you!

90
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,440
Now you're kicking my swords, too?!

91
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,900
Where's my "thanks"?

92
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,650
Yeah...

93
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,690
Thanks!

94
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,410
It's no use!
Three swords won't help any!

95
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,220
Your skill's still the same!

96
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:01,960
Tiger...

97
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,420
You don't get it, do you?

98
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,830
...Trap!

99
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,070
Four minutes.

100
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,390
Just having three swords is different

101
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,810
from knowing the Three-Sword Style!

102
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,070
He's strong...

103
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,990
One hit...

104
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,610
H-He beat the Meowban
Brothers in one hit!

105
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,220
Don't worry!

106
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,780
I'll crush every last one of you
before your five minutes are up!

107
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,850
Three minutes.

108
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,170
I-I'll... slaughter him...

109
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,260
C-Captain...

110
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,910
H-Hypnotize me...

111
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,370
P-Please, Captain!

112
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,080
He's alive. You do sloppy work.

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,880
His tough fat saved him, huh?

114
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,290
Get 'im, Butchie!

115
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,770
More hypnosis?!

116
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,210
This guy means trouble! He could
already crack the ground apart!

117
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,590
What happens when he's powered up?!

118
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,990
This is my chance!

119
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,790
I gotta wake him up while I still can!

120
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,700
What is that crafty girl up to now?

121
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,620
Everyone's seriously hurt,
and he's just sleeping!

122
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,780
Die!

123
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,630
Get up!

124
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,510
Nami! Look out!

125
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,720
Two minutes.

126
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,860
Get up!

127
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,740
Nami! Look out!

128
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,710
Split in two!

129
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,330
Dodge it!

130
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,760
W-What the...?!

131
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,170
A chakram! It wasn't
just a hypnosis tool?!

132
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:26,210
Nami! How dare you stomp on my face?!

133
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,710
H-He's alive?!

134
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,920
Can't tell if he has bad or good timing...

135
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,680
L-Luffy...

136
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,230
Luffy!

137
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,140
Oww...

138
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,270
Ouch!

139
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,120
H-He's alive again!

140
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,060
This is bad!

141
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,560
Five minutes is impossible now!

142
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,630
Nami! That hurts, you jerk!

143
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,510
T-That wasn't me!

144
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,280
It wasn't me--

145
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,490
N-Nami! Did you hurt your shoulder?

146
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,580
I-It's nothing. I'm fine...

147
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,680
I've done everything I can for now,
so I leave the rest to you...

148
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,390
We absolutely can't
afford to lose this fight...

149
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,030
Yeah!

150
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,180
For the treasure!

151
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,020
It'll all work out in the end!

152
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,110
Try hard! For my treasure!

153
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,040
Okay! That sounds like you, alright!

154
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,790
One minute.

155
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,150
You can't be serious!

156
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,330
Not even Captain Jango
and Butchie-san...

157
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,140
...can finish them in one minute!

158
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,260
Butchie! There's no time to think!

159
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,280
Kill that haramaki bastard!

160
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,440
And I'll handle that weird kid...

161
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,840
I'll kill Straw Hat!

162
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,390
It's about time for everyone to die now.

163
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,900
Huh? That bad butler is here too!

164
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,160
Isn't he...

165
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,190
Didn't he fall off that cliff and die?

166
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,320
No matter.

167
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,320
Don't approach me...

168
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,810
...from behind!

169
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,710
Kaya!

170
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,680
U-Usopp-san! Are you okay?!

171
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,540
K-Kaya... What are you doing here?!

172
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,310
I'm so sorry, Usopp-san...

173
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,150
I know you may not accept my apology,

174
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,830
but I just couldn't believe it...

175
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,820
K-Klahadore, a pirate...

176
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,250
N-Never mind that!
Why are you here?!

177
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,100
I-I told you to run away!

178
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,420
Your life is in danger!

179
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,250
But you're fighting!

180
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,320
Even after I treated you so horribly
and you've been hurt so much,

181
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,510
you're still fighting for me! So I...

182
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,990
Miss Kaya...

183
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,690
Why are you here?

184
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,780
S-Stop this...

185
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,790
Stop this, Klahadore!

186
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,170
Merry told me everything.

187
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,920
Isn't that the girl from the mansion?

188
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,240
Meaning she's the plan's final target?!

189
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,970
Then there's no need to
go to the village now?

190
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,220
We just need to kill her, right?!

191
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,750
Klahadore, please! If you want
my fortune, you can have it all!

192
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,650
Just please leave
this village! Right now!

193
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,630
I will gladly accept it... but...

194
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,330
...there's one other
thing I want, you see...

195
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,770
What I want...

196
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,770
...is peace of mind.

197
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,480
Peace?

198
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,430
Yes. I want simple peace.

199
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,620
I find the villagers' trust that I've
fostered these past three years

200
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,020
to be nice and comfortable now.

201
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,230
So I want to have that
peace of mind forever...

202
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,840
And I...

203
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,730
And I will have that peace!
And your fortune...

204
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,660
In short, pirates will
come to the village!

205
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,710
And...

206
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,020
...you will leave your will and die!

207
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,000
These two things are absolute.

208
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,440
N-No...

209
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,950
Y-You're not...

210
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,730
Run! Run away, Kaya!

211
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,870
There's no use talking to him! Run away!

212
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,380
Y-You're not Klahadore.
You're not Klahadore...

213
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,430
Kaya...

214
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,920
Leave this village!

215
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,010
Oh... You'd point a gun at me...

216
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,510
Leave this minute!

217
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,830
I see. You've certainly grown
a lot these past three years...

218
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,400
...Miss Kaya.

219
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:31,070
Do you remember? So much
has happened in three years...

220
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,200
We spent so much time together,

221
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,130
even before your parents passed
away and you became bedridden...

222
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,590
So much time...

223
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,390
So many memories...
Together we suffered...

224
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,520
Together we rejoiced...

225
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,720
K-Klahadore...

226
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,710
I would visit the city with you,

227
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,220
and whenever you had a fever,
I constantly looked after you...

228
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,810
You listened to my stories so happily...

229
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,390
I devoted myself to you...

230
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,320
For so long...

231
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,970
Yes, for so long, I endured it...

232
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:28,780
Yes, it was all so that
I could kill you today...

233
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,640
I, a man once known as Captain Kuro,

234
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,350
had to smile humbly
for some snot-nosed girl...

235
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,760
I went against my nature
and sucked up to you...

236
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,440
Damn you...

237
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,390
Do you understand these daily insults?!

238
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,120
Do you understand this man
once known as Captain Kuro?!

239
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,840
Kuro!

240
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,230
Come to think of it...

241
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,880
...I still owe you for hitting me...

242
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,100
Usopp-san!

243
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,350
You hit me with all
your might, as I recall...

244
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:06,600
If you hate getting hit that much,
I got a hundred more punches for you!

245
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

246
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

247
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

248
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:52,540
If the world is going to change

249
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:59,550
before I can even attain my dream

250
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:06,620
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

251
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:20,000
so that my memories won't fade

252
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,470
Usopp! You go save Miss Kaya!
Leave the bad butler to me!

253
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,320
What a helplessly evil guy!

254
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,680
I don't plan to help him, though!

255
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,380
I'm goin' after that hypno-freak!

256
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,290
Kuro! You're not cut out to be a pirate!

257
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,820
My ambition is much greater than yours!

258
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,760
On the next episode of One Piece!

259
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,000
"Beat Kuro! Usopp the Man's
Tearful Resolve!"

260
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,720
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
