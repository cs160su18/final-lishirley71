2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,700
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,810
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,860
who has been captured by the Navy.

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,720
Now at level 4 the Burning Heat Floor,

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,860
Warden Magellan has ambushed him!

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,500
I'll find out all about when
and how you broke in...

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,160
...after I pass down your sentence!

57
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,270
I'm not gonna tell you
even if it means death!

58
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,010
No!

59
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,680
Straw-chan!

60
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,690
Bon-chan!

61
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,140
Why did you do that?!

62
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,600
I told you that you can't fight!

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
The poison will harm you
if you get it all over you

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,270
but even one touch will be lethal!

65
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,620
Venom Road!

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,990
No matter how hard you try...

67
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,670
...you can't get away from me!

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,850
Magellan guards the worst prisoners
in the worst prison in the world!

69
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,330
He's the master of hell!

70
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,400
Make up your mind, Bon Clay!

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,170
There's no way to beat Magellan!

72
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,370
I'm sorry!

73
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,410
We have no chance to win!

74
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,150
I'm sorry but I gotta run!

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,630
I'm sorry, Straw-chan!

76
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,960
I'm sorry!

77
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,840
Don't you wanna give up now?

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,590
I'm not gonna let you execute Ace!

79
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,980
I don't wanna lose to you by not
touching you because you're poisonous!

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,850
I'd rather touch you and...

81
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,200
...give you my arms!

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,400
Gum-Gum...

83
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,760
...Jet Bazooka!

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,390
"The Showdown Has Come!
Luffy's Desperate Last Attack!"

85
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,280
How thoughtless you guys are!

86
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,160
If you'd have just shut up and gotten away,

87
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,720
I could have laid the blame on Warden!

88
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm at the staircase to level 3!

89
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,060
We have some casualties
caused by the escapees' raid!

90
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,600
Yes, we have Buggy the Clown
and Mr. 3 in custody!

91
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,550
I told you to just be on your way
but you just had to fight me!

92
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,700
You stupid bastards!

93
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,910
H-H-He's strong!

94
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,620
Surprisingly strong!

95
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,980
Damn Hannyabal!

96
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,810
I don't wanna be tortured!

97
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,350
If I'm going to get tortured, I will...

98
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,380
...bite off my tongue right here!

99
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,050
Okay... I'm gonna bite... now!

100
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm really gonna do it!

101
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,030
H-He's coming!

102
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,760
Hey! Get out of my way!

103
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,800
Outta my way, you fools!

104
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,100
If you don't wanna get hurt,

105
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,730
just let me go through!

106
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,990
Let's get Mr. 2!

107
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,700
Damn! Don't stand in my way!

108
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,870
Drunken Swan Soiree!

109
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,960
There's no way we can beat him!

110
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,390
I'm not gonna dream an impossible dream!

111
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,900
If I'd stayed there any longer,
I'm 200% sure that I'd be killed!

112
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,560
I've gotta run!

113
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,990
Don't look back!

114
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,850
All I can do is run!

115
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,380
Straw-chan!

116
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,070
You seem to have brought me to my knees!

117
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,570
We never know what a cornered rat will do!

118
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,990
But now you got enough poison on your hand...

119
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,210
...to affect your whole body!

120
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,970
It must really hurt, poor boy!

121
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,070
You still don't give up?!

122
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,990
Gum-Gum...

123
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,370
...Twin Jet Pistol!

124
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,640
Venom Blowfish!

125
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,860
Gum-Gum...

126
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,980
...Jet...

127
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,730
Hydra!

128
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,830
...Pistol!

129
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,300
It didn't hurt him at all?!

130
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,600
Fog?

131
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,320
Venom Cloud!

132
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,930
Damn it!

133
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,510
It's no use!

134
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,730
That poison fog is a part of me!

135
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,850
It's alive!

136
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,050
Your vision's blurry?

137
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,100
Your ears are ringing?

138
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,930
Gum-Gum...

139
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,520
...Balloon!

140
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,770
I said "it's no use!"

141
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,330
Why can't you see that?!

142
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,500
No matter how hard you try,
there's no way out for you!

143
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,880
I assume that you can't use your hands now!

144
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,680
My poison will take...

145
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,630
...everything from you in time!

146
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,500
LEVEL 4--IN FRONT OF THE STAIRCASE

147
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,280
I'm going to bite off my tongue now!

148
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,680
I am really doing it!

149
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,390
You can't stop me!

150
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,370
I can't do it!

151
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,900
Dammit!

152
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,450
Take them away!

153
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,320
Yes, sir!

154
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,560
Fools!

155
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,810
Wait... D-D-Don't do this to me!

156
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,020
Please don't!

157
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,070
I-I don't want gomon (torture)!

158
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,090
Komon (anus) stinks!

159
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,910
Yes, it does!

160
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,840
Wait right there!

161
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,750
W-Who is it?!

162
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,090
He sounds familiar!

163
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,670
Isn't he...?!

164
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,000
Swan Arabesque!

165
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,390
W-Who are you?!

166
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,900
You!

167
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,280
Mr. 2!

168
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,310
The third escapee?!

169
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,160
Damn!

170
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,170
That's enough!

171
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,930
Take this! And this! And this!...

172
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,900
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois!

173
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,450
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux...

174
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,770
Take this 'n this 'n this!...

175
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,970
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois! Un...

176
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,030
You're quite a fighter!

177
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,900
But you can't get away!

178
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,960
Ack?

179
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,610
Who are you?

180
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,850
So cute!

181
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,710
W-W-What are you doing?

182
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,280
You really don't know when to give up!

183
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,380
You want to rescue your brother that much?

184
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,960
It'd be easier if you just stop fighting.
Just close your eyes!

185
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,290
Gum-Gum...

186
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,750
...Pistol!

187
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,050
Hey, jailer!

188
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,070
Tell me the truth!

189
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,860
Is there something going on the upper levels?

190
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,880
No, there isn't.

191
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,840
Are you out of your mind?

192
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,610
Why are you so determined?

193
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,180
Portgaz D. Ace is a major criminal
who is soon to be executed!

194
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,550
And you're an intruder who
wants to help a criminal like him!

195
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,160
I won't forgive any of those offenses!

196
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,040
Ace's execution in Marineford is...

197
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,510
...the absolutely final decision
provided for under the law!

198
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,710
There is nothing you can do about it!

199
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,250
Shut up!

200
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,640
Stay away...

201
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,380
Stay away!

202
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,850
Luffy!

203
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,050
This is pathetic.

204
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,290
Gum-Gum...

205
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,880
...Stamp!

206
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,930
Have you had enough now?

207
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,020
Second Gear!

208
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,200
Hydra!

209
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,640
Give me...

210
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,500
...Ace!

211
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,030
This is your punishment.

212
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,730
There is no way to neutralize the
amount of poison you have absorbed!

213
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,540
You will agonize for 24 hours

214
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,650
and then pass...

215
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,010
...to the real hell!

216
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,980
A... A...

217
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,810
Ace!

218
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,330
After being defeated by Magellan,
Luffy is tossed into level 5.

219
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,970
Despite knowing there's no antidote for the poison,

220
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,430
Bon Clay makes a stand to save his friend.

221
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,470
However, standing in his way
is a pack of Army Wolves!

222
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

223
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,900
"For his friend!
Bon Clay Goes to the Deadly Rescue!"

224
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,330
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
