2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,670
After being separated
from his friends,

50
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,130
Luffy comes to the rescue his brother
Ace who has been captured by the Navy

51
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,780
by sneaking into Impel Down -
the greatest prison in the world!

52
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,580
Now, he is racing to level 5 with
a help of Buggy the Clown.

53
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,080
Now I'm free! I finally got the treasure
mark that I always dreamed of!

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,750
Down to level 3 or level 4 - it doesn't
matter either way you're a goner!

55
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,090
Stupid Blugori! You can't chop
me because I ate Chop-Chop fruit!

56
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,920
"The Strongest Man in the Prison!
Poison Man Magellan Appears!"

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,040
I just finished breaking out of my
cell! I don't wanna fall to another hell!

58
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,710
Ow, ow, ow...

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,180
This is pretty creepy!

60
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,600
But, at least now I have this which means

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm seconds away from finding
Captain John's treasure!

62
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,110
All I have to do is
find my way out of...

63
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,620
Okay, let's go!
Tell me the way!

64
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,440
W-W-Wait a second!

65
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,180
It's a dead end!

66
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,770
So this is level 2...

67
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,440
Yes!

68
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,260
It's worse than the Crimson Hell of
level 1! It's called Wild Beast Hell!

69
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,500
You bastard! You had
me running like an idiot!

70
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,370
This floor has all the wild
beasts of hell everywhere!

71
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,880
Wild beasts of hell?

72
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,400
Damn it! Well, until I get
a chance to run away,

73
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,270
I'll take full advantage
of Straw Hat!

74
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,340
Is that one of them?

75
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,640
They found us already!

76
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,080
It looks like a hippo to me.

77
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,780
Um, yeah.

78
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,920
It's smaller than a regular hippo. Is
that what you'd call a "wild beast"?

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,290
It's odd! I heard
that level 2 has...

80
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,790
Augh! What's
this thing?! Run!

81
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,790
Wow! He's pretty
fast for a hippo!

82
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,290
Stop admiring it!
Turn left here!

83
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,430
He crashed into the wall!

84
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,640
He runs pretty fast but can
only run in a straight line!

85
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,670
So you really don't mind
that your body got eaten?!

86
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,320
You'll see! I'm the Chop-Chop
man - Buggy-sama!

87
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,550
How did you manage that?

88
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,600
Even if my body parts are chopped
to pieces, I can move them as I want!

89
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,350
That will learn ya!
You little hippo!

90
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,810
Who is that guy with Buggy?

91
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,460
Isn't there any way I can
just get out of here?!

92
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,950
What's wrong?

93
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,460
I think I saw something!

94
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,610
A bat, maybe?

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,890
Chop-Chop Quick Escape!

96
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
It's a monster mantis!

97
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,430
Yeah, it's too big
for a mantis...

98
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,720
He cuts like a pro!

99
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,790
How can you be
so impressed?!

100
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,730
If I get chopped up much
more, it'll be a big problem!

101
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
You're an amazing fighter!

102
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,410
How can you be so relaxed?

103
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,180
--Do you think he's stuck?
--Yeah.

104
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,740
What should we do?

105
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,680
Well, maybe we should...

106
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,720
Wanna just go?

107
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,150
Yeah, let's just go.

108
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,240
Are these really
wild beasts of hell?

109
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,750
They're not that big deal.

110
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,210
Yeah, they're not
as bad as I heard.

111
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,110
Level 1 was way more
terrifying than this.

112
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,980
Well, if you think about it, wild beasts
of hell can only really exist in...

113
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,800
What was that?

114
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,820
What's the matter?

115
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,180
It is a wild beast of hell!

116
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,930
Oh! This guy...

117
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,530
Damn it! What I heard was true!
We're gonna get eaten this time for sure!

118
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,210
I didn't wanna come to level 2!

119
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,360
I was about to make my escape without you!

120
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,490
What? Did you say something?!
What's this creature?!

121
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,120
I think it's the most
rare kind of mutant!

122
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,410
A snake born from a
chicken's egg - a Basilisk!

123
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,370
"Prison Guard
BASILISK"

124
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,550
These things come
from chickens?!

125
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,440
Are you kidding?
That's why they call it a monster!

126
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,960
If it's allowed to roam
free, it'd eat everybody!

127
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,510
So they leave it here as a guard!

128
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,220
What're you doing?!

129
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,800
I don't have time for this! Alright, you!

130
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,910
You're gonna get
your ass kicked!

131
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,910
But that's not so bad! I'll
just make my escape!

132
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll leave the rest up to you!
Bye, Straw Hat!

133
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,910
Third Gear!

134
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,430
Jailers on level 2!

135
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,920
We identified the guy that
Buggy the Clown is with!

136
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,550
It's Straw Hat Luffy!

137
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,410
--That Straw Hat?!
--He's in Impel Down?!

138
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,310
Capture them right away!
Dead or alive!

139
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,720
Let's go!

140
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,740
Gum-Gum...

141
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,730
...Giant Pistol!

142
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,480
What's this?
What happened?!

143
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,410
What's going on on level 2?!

144
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,290
It's hot!

145
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,100
Yes, as Vice Warden
told you before,

146
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,190
the Warden's office is on level
4 - the Burning Heat Floor.

147
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,660
The whole floor except for his
office is a burning inferno.

148
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,930
Okay, we are here.

149
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,440
Where's the Warden?

150
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,450
Warden Magellan has terrible digestive
problems so he stays in a bathroom...

151
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,650
...for about 10
hours every day.

152
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,100
On top of that, he needs 8 hours of sleep

153
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,980
and then there're mealtimes and breaks

154
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,260
so he usually works for
about 4 hours a day.

155
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,870
Is it enough for a warden?

156
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,150
When the need arises,
he is the right man. Oh!

157
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,540
Sorry to keep you
waiting. He is coming out.

158
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,250
I forgot to mention but Warden ate
Venom-Venom Fruit so he is a poison man.

159
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,600
A poison man?

160
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,910
Please be careful.

161
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,570
--Thank you for your trouble!
--Thank you for your trouble, Warden!

162
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,270
As always, it was
a tough battle!

163
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,060
You must be a guest. I'm
the warden, Magellan.

164
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,700
"The Warden of Impel Down
Magellan
(Venom-Venom Fruit Eater - Poison Man)"

165
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,060
It's too bright!
Why is it so bright in here?

166
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,560
I'd prefer to stay closed up in a dark room!

167
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,850
If possible, I want to keep
my heart closed in, too!

168
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,710
Stop being
ridiculous! Warden,

169
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,590
Vice Admiral Momonga and
Boa Hancock-dono are here!

170
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,720
We're a bit pressed for
time, Warden Magellan!

171
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,470
I'm sorry! You see, I've got a
pretty bad case of the runs.

172
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,990
The poison soup that I had for
breakfast seems to disagree with me..

173
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,690
What do you
expect? It's poison!

174
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,330
I'm a poison man
so I love poisons!

175
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,060
There is a saying -
"Poison quells poison."

176
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,700
It's just an expression.
That's why you have diarrhea.

177
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,840
You have a venomous
tongue, Hannyabal!

178
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,410
Hurry up and retire so
I can become warden...

179
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,410
Oh, silly me! I meant, hurry up
and show them "Fire Fist"...

180
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,550
That's terrible
mistake you made!

181
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,450
What a heartless
colleague I have!

182
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,320
Put this on!

183
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,520
H-Hey! Be careful
when you exhale!

184
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,390
Your breath is poison gas!

185
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,530
Right! That's so funny!

186
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,990
That serves you right,
stupid vice warden!

187
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,350
He spews venom!

188
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,210
Hey you! What did you just
breathe in my face?! That's rude!

189
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,080
Wow! What a beautiful
woman! I'm in love!

190
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,510
Oh, he's so lucky...

191
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,310
Vice Warden, that's
Warden's seat.

192
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,080
It'll become mine in time.

193
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,210
We're in a hurry!

194
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,840
This is the Warden's office.

195
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,760
What are you doing
answering my phone?

196
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,870
No! Can't take it! Damn!

197
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,920
I wanted to be a warden...

198
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,100
Get an antidote
for Vice Warden!

199
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,350
Aye!

200
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,380
What?! Someone's
broken in to Impel Down?!

201
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,500
That's impossible! In this prison's entire
history, no one has ever broken in!

202
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,050
This is a grave error! And
you're responsible, Warden!

203
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,320
Did they notice our plan?!

204
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,130
Transfer the video!

205
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,110
Warden!

206
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,170
Can I see the prisoner now?

207
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,670
Okay, let's go!
I'm ready to go!

208
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,010
W-Warden! Don't you
realize how serious this is?!

209
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,690
What's going on?!
They haven't replied?!

210
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,390
It's odd! We've lost contact
with Warden Magellan!

211
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,740
Hurry and report to the jailers' room on
each floor and to Navy Headquarters.

212
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,410
I don't know why he's
here and what he's up to

213
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,630
but the guy running around with Buggy
on level 2 that we saw just now is

214
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,380
the pirate, Straw Hat Luffy!

215
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,890
We can't reach the
jailers' room on level 2!

216
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,000
What?!

217
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,350
Damn! It's everywhere!
What's going on?!

218
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,430
Just keep trying
until they reply!

219
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,060
Yes, sir!

220
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,140
Jailers' room on level
2! What's wrong?!

221
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,480
Come in, jailers' room!

222
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,730
Yes!

223
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,190
His fist became huge!

224
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,070
Gum-Gum...

225
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,610
...Giant Pistol!

226
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,650
And why are you
so small now?!

227
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,010
'Cause it's Third Gear.

228
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,150
I hardly beat it!

229
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,020
Okay, I'm reverted!

230
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,590
Let's go now!

231
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,920
The God of salvation
has descended to hell!

232
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,600
Amazing! He
defeated the monster!

233
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,100
He beat the Basilisk!

234
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,480
You did it! You
guys are awesome!

235
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,990
They have destroyed
the jailers' room, too.

236
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,670
It's unbelievable! They
must be sent from heaven!

237
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,570
I don't know who you
are but thank you!

238
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,850
Can you get us keys, too?
For the doors and cuffs!

239
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,990
Hey, they're right
there on the ground!

240
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,910
He is...

241
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,960
Let's keep going!

242
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,930
Don't rush!

243
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,290
I don't have time!

244
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,090
...Straw Hat Luffy!
Why is he here?!

245
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:17,260
Well, he's not in a cell - looks
like he's on his way out!

246
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,540
I've gotta take this
chance, it's now or never!

247
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,390
Heaven hasn't
forgotten me yet!

248
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,190
Hey, you guys! Is this
what you're looking for?

249
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,570
--Of course, we want it!
--Give it to me now!

250
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,780
What? Is that how you ask
somebody for a favor?

251
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,750
We're sorry! We're
begging you!

252
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,710
There's no excuse!
Please, sir!

253
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,030
What? What d'you
say? I can't hear you!

254
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,930
What're you doing?

255
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,670
Please, sir!

256
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,320
Alright! I'm giving you this!

257
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,880
It's a favor of Captain
Buggy-sama! Accept it gratefully!

258
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,810
Yeah! We're free!

259
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,260
We're out of the cells!

260
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,920
Thank me, you idiots!

261
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,910
Tell me who has set you free!

262
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,290
Captain Buggy!
We're indebted to you forever!

263
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,920
Captain Buggy is our savior!

264
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,940
Yes, I am! Don't you
ever forget my name!

265
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,380
Now, unlock all the cells!

266
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,300
I fell down here by chance, but if I start
chaos, it'll give me a chance to get out!

267
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,590
--Alright, are you happy now? Now, it's my turn!
--Let me go! Let me go! You fool!

268
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,140
--Lead me now!
--Hey! Straw Hat!

269
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,850
Is there any hole
like the last time?

270
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,630
I don't know the
way to level 3!

271
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,530
How can I remember all floors
of this maze-like prison?

272
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,270
Thank you, Captain Buggy!

273
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,620
I can smell freedom...

274
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,090
Ugh! Stop, Straw Hat!

275
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,100
Why should I?! You said
that you'd lead me to level 4!

276
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,680
I lied, I lied! I wanted the
treasure so I lied to you!

277
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,060
Those prisoners are gonna run
rampant on this floor and...

278
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,940
You lied to me?!

279
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,570
What's that?

280
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,920
What're you doing?! It's your
chance to break out in chaos!

281
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,360
We just had a dose of reality!

282
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,760
There's no way to escape if the
boss of this floor is still here!

283
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,890
Yeah, it's safer to be in a cell.

284
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,940
O-Okay, Straw Hat! I'll
guide you to level 3!

285
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,520
You just said that you don't
know the way, Big Nose!

286
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,130
What did you just call me?!

287
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,320
If you're having trouble on
this floor, I can help you.

288
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,160
Who is that guy?

289
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,000
Long time no see,
Straw Hat Luffy!

290
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,310
You helped me out
without noticing.

291
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,170
I always pay back my debts.

292
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,630
Who are you?

293
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,630
Oh, that's 3! That means...

294
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,050
Yow! Look at that weird hair!

295
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,510
Shut up!

296
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,350
And it's on fire!

297
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,100
Take that! Candle Lock!

298
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,930
Oh, this is perfect!

299
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,870
Gum-Gum...

300
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,650
...Mallet!

301
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,850
Now, can you tell
which is the real me?

302
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,910
You're just a powerful fool who acts
only on instinct. You can't catch me!

303
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,710
I am Mr. 3! I always get
the job done perfectly!

304
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,090
Gum-Gum...

305
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,380
...Stamp!

306
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,140
How did you know
where I was...?

307
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,760
Instinct.

308
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,920
You were on the island with
the Giants! You are San!

309
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,270
No, I'm Mr. Three!

310
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,610
"Prisoner Number D-0464
Former Baroque Works Agent
Mr. 3"

311
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,700
Fleet Admiral Sengoku! We just got an
emergency report from Impel Down!

312
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,760
Hmmm? What happened? Don't
tell me it's about Whitebeard.

313
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,710
No, Straw Hat Luffy
has infiltrated.

314
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,350
What?! Straw Hat?
What's going on?

315
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,910
I thought that Bartholomew
Kuma took care of him.

316
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,220
Yes, that's what we heard.

317
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,200
But why would a pirate
sneak into Impel Down?

318
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,810
What is he up to?

319
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,270
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

320
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,400
I don't know what he wants but this
time, it's the end of the road for him.

321
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,780
Because the place
he finds himself...

322
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,430
...is a prison that has held hundreds
of thousands of prisoners in the past

323
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,110
without allowing even a
single breakout or escape.

324
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,540
It's a truly iron-tight, great
prison - Impel Down!

325
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,820
Of course, it's their blunder to
let him enter in the first place

326
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,540
but there is absolutely no way that
the kid will walk out of there alive!

327
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,390
Oh no! There was one guy...

328
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,540
There was?

329
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:04,140
Twenty years ago, he became the first and
only escapee in the history of Impel Down.

330
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,260
He's a pirate named
Shiki the Golden Lion.

331
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,310
Shiki the Golden Lion?

332
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,710
Twenty years ago, one man

333
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,190
became the first and only escapee
in the history of Impel Down.

334
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,590
His name was Shiki the Golden Lion.

335
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,890
In the present, the Straw Hats encounter
a giant beetle while sailing the seas

336
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,390
and find themselves caught
up in Shiki's ambitions.

337
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

338
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,930
"A Special Presentation Related to the Movie!
A Gold Lion's Ambition on the Move!"

339
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
