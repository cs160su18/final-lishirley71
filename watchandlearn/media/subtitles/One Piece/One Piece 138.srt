00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,820
It's...

20
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,730
...a trap! A trap by the navy!

21
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,040
Guys!

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,610
Usopp!

23
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,060
Sail on!

24
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,330
Impossible! A pirate ship,
coming out of the mountains?!

25
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,630
Old man!

26
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,970
"Whereabouts of the Island Treasure!
Attack of the Zenny Pirates!"

27
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,530
Is that...?

28
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,250
You did it, old man!

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,080
Hey, don't act so reckless.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,930
His heart hasn't stopped, right?

31
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,240
Hey, cut that out!

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,140
Old-timer! Are you okay?!

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm finally out at sea.

34
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,840
I really have become a pirate!

35
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,270
Yeah! This is no longer my coffin!

36
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,940
It's the good pirate ship Zenny!
Isn't that right?!

37
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,710
Way to go, old man!

38
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,370
We told you, don't egg him on!

39
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,620
He's a sick man!

40
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,520
What are you trying to pull,
Zenny the Moneylender?

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Your profession is to extort
money from pirates, isn't it?!

42
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,580
I gave up lending money long ago.

43
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,620
Right now, I'm Zenny the Pirate!

44
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,050
Don't you sell the navy short, you old geezer!

45
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,510
Old man, watch yourself!
He's after your treasure!

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,640
Oh? Lately, the navy has taken to
going after treasure on the side,

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,720
in addition to capturing pirates, have they?

48
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,560
That's quite industrious of you.

49
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,310
--Nami, bring the ship over.
--Got it. Come on, everyone.

50
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,090
Why, you! Don't give Nami-san any orders!

51
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,640
Sergeant Minchy!
The Straw Hats are on the move!

52
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,410
Contact Captain Moore's fleet for backup!

53
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,400
Shut up!

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,780
I told you, I'd give you your cut of the treasure.

55
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,340
You understand, don't you?
We can't let the captain know.

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,950
The way I figure it...

57
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,180
You're keeping your men hushed
up to take on this side project.

58
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,860
That must cost a pretty penny,
huh, Mr. Sergeant?

59
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,070
Why, you dotty old coot!
Don't think you won't pay for this!

60
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,530
Silence, boy!

61
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,510
You've got some nerve,
trying to swipe my treasure!

62
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,500
Come and take it from me, if you can!

63
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,490
Way to go, old man!

64
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,840
Show them how a pirate fights!

65
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,570
--There!
--You idiot!

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,400
What are you doing...?

67
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,610
Why, you...!

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,120
If you're a pirate, then you won't mind
it when the navy kills you, right?!

69
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,520
Come to think of it, does the old
man have any sort of weapon?

70
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,400
Show me what you've got! Take on
my class 10-ranked abacus skills!

71
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,660
Get them!

72
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,120
His abacus and...

73
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,040
...the goats.

74
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,060
What?! Oh, no!

75
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,600
Old man!

76
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,070
That idiot! Luffy!

77
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,100
What are you guys, idiots?
What are you shooting at?!

78
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,780
You shouldn't waste your
bullets like that! I'm right here!

79
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,570
Let's go!

80
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,520
What are you doing?! They're goats!
You're taking on goats!

81
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,420
It's because they're goats
that I can't do it, Sergeant.

82
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,240
Hey! The battle has already begun!

83
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,100
Stop watching the goings-on from
on high, and come on down here!

84
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,600
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

85
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,000
We know. Stand aside for a minute.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Relax, Chopper!

87
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,560
But...

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,280
The old-timer is in no physical shape
to be doing anything so crazy!

89
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,290
--Shoot them!
--Don't shoot!

90
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,260
Now you've done it!
My boys are out of control!

91
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,980
Charge!

92
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,780
Hey, look! They're waiting for us in formation!

93
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,770
It's strange how they don't show
any signs of movement, huh?

94
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,250
We have to think up a battle
plan now, while we can.

95
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,490
So, what shall we do?
Be the first ones to attack them?

96
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,710
--Don't be crazy!
--In any case...!

97
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,880
Right now, we have to
help the old-timer! Hurry!

98
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,520
By the way, did we hit something a minute ago?

99
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,480
--Huh? Did we?
--Never mind! Hurry!

100
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,630
Captain Moore, there's no response
from Sergeant Minchy's ship.

101
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,640
What was that sound of
gunfire we heard earlier?

102
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,810
Shall we advance?

103
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,610
No, not yet. Wait for Minchy to report in.

104
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,060
Where did you guys go?

105
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,700
Enough out of you, already!

106
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,540
That's enough of that!

107
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,250
All right!

108
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,150
Where's all that energy you had a moment ago?

109
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,480
Zenny the Pirate, are you out of breath?

110
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,280
Hey, you've finally come forward,
you little miscreant.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,290
You sure are a talkative bastard!

112
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,590
Now then, shall we get down to business?

113
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,440
Where is your treasure located,
Zenny the Pirate?

114
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,530
What, Corporal?!

115
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,740
Why didn't you report this sooner?!

116
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,700
I'm terribly sorry, Captain Moore.

117
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,620
What a sneaky stunt to pull!
That miserable Minchy...

118
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,920
So that was what he was up to!

119
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,550
Why don't you spit it out, already?
You don't want to die yet, do you?

120
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,810
I do value my own life. I cherish it.

121
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,680
Let me tell you, I'm penniless.
What do you want me to spit out?

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,300
I can't even manage any spittle.

123
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,240
Fine, then.

124
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,040
As dinky an island as this is,

125
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,750
it won't take much work to dig
it up from one end to the other.

126
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,380
I have no further need of you.

127
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,130
Why, you...!

128
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,010
You're through!

129
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,560
I seem to have broken your abacus.
Sorry about that.

130
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,400
What the hell are you doing?!

131
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,160
You think you can defy the
navy and get away with it--

132
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,660
Old-timer!

133
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,530
You guys are late! I almost died, here!

134
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,960
Waah! I was so worried!

135
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:32,920
Smoke Star!!

136
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,120
That's far enough!

137
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,920
Robin, this is where you were?

138
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,010
Old man, you can relax,
now that Captain Usopp is here--

139
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,890
What happened? That bump is huge!

140
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,350
There's no pulse!

141
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,850
Calm down, Chopper. I'm over here, over here.

142
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,900
I knew that! Here, take it easy, and lie down.

143
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,700
Don't you die, old-timer!

144
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,700
You think I would die?

145
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,920
How are you feeling, old man?

146
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,100
I feel fine, of course. I'm finally a pirate.

147
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,970
I don't feel like dying anymore.

148
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,360
We just came to the island
on the sergeant's orders.

149
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,940
Yeah... well, I guess subordinates
can't go against their superiors.

150
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,400
Listen, our captain is pretty
capricious himself, you know?

151
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,860
You don't say.

152
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,410
Hey, don't go getting too chummy.

153
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,190
O-Old man, are you okay?

154
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,960
Are you okay, lad?

155
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,590
Good grief, there's just no helping Luffy!

156
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,920
Your seizure has passed, so that's a relief, huh?

157
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,180
Much obliged, Dr. Chopper.

158
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,020
Sorry about that. Old man, how's tricks?

159
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,780
Just fine, thanks.

160
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,740
Ah, right. Listen, Gramps,
you can tell us now, can't you?

161
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,380
About your treasure?

162
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,390
Hey! Don't go giving any shocks to my patients!

163
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,910
Old-timer, stay strong!

164
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,470
For the love of...

165
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,130
Yeah, I guess you have done a lot for me,

166
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,380
so maybe I can tell you.

167
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,310
That's more like it! Look,
the navy knows about it, and all,

168
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,590
so it must be an amazing treasure, right?

169
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,750
I did... have a treasure...

170
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,180
The pirates who owed me signed over
a whole heap of treasure to me.

171
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,200
But then, thinking of buying a pirate ship,
and getting my pals together,

172
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,400
I exchanged all of it for cash.

173
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,640
Cash!

174
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,410
Thinking back on it, that's when my fate turned.

175
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,240
I told you last night that I was
attacked by those who had owed

176
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,250
money to me, and I ended up
drifting ashore on this island, right?

177
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,250
Well, naturally, I managed
to protect the money.

178
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,610
After all, I'd risked my life for that
money in order to buy my dream.

179
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,180
When I came to, after
washing up on the beach...

180
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,280
--It was eaten?!
--Really?!

181
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,950
All of it?! They ate all of it?!

182
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,160
That's right. Well, maybe
they left two or three bills.

183
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,460
And so, like I told you,
these guys are my treasure.

184
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,120
All of my fortune may have been lost,

185
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,180
but in return, I gained my friends.

186
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,120
They don't betray me, or try to cheat me.

187
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,990
Now, I have friends at my side,

188
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,360
who don't do anything for selfish motives.

189
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,940
And so, I want to reward them for it.

190
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,980
I've obtained the greatest
treasure in the world.

191
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,820
Good for you, old man.

192
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,520
Yeah, it is good. I'm a man that
takes advantage of every situation.

193
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,830
What a load of crap! Hey, Straw Hat!
This fight isn't over yet!

194
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,040
There's a pristine fleet over
there just waiting for you!

195
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,030
Don't think you're going to get away so easily!

196
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,530
Don't go trying to act cool
when you're rolling around.

197
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,260
What is he, stupid?

198
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,810
You're the stupid ones!

199
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,470
Do you think you can stand up
to a fleet of nine ships?!

200
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,020
I'm not running away.

201
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,690
Tell them that if they want a fight,
to come straight at me.

202
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,860
Gum-Gum...

203
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,570
Hey, Luffy! A little bit higher!

204
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,850
Okay!

205
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,540
...Pistol!!

206
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, direction is good.

207
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,970
You... disgrace to the navy!

208
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,560
--Take him away!
--Yes, sir!

209
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,240
This is Naval Captain Moore.

210
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,450
I have no interest in the island,
or in this man Zenny.

211
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,000
My only goal is to bring you down,
in the name of justice.

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,880
To show my gratitude for turning over
this misguided member of my fleet,

213
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,760
I will allow you to choose where we fight.

214
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,260
Come, bring your ship out.

215
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,110
We were thinking of leaving pretty soon, too.

216
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,720
We'll be coming toward you right away.

217
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,390
Here, old man, I fixed it for you.

218
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,480
Oh, I should have known. Much obliged.

219
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,670
Don't mention it.

220
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,850
Everything is all set up through
supper. You just have to cook it.

221
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,610
Yeah, much obliged.

222
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,820
Then again, lads, are you sure about this?

223
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,620
You're facing a fleet of nine ships, right?

224
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,240
Don't worry about it.

225
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,330
I'm not just strong, I'm lucky, too.

226
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,960
I can't keep up with you, lad.

227
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,200
Old-timer, I made up a whole supply for you,

228
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,920
so make sure you take your medicine.

229
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,360
Promise me!

230
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,470
Yeah, all right, all right. I'll make
sure I take it, don't you worry.

231
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,190
--It's been fun, Gramps!
--Take care.

232
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,840
Guys, you take care of the old-timer!

233
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,610
We'll see you later, out on the seas somewhere!

234
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:22,280
Yeah! Once I finish repairs to the ship,
I'm going to be setting sail!

235
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,960
We'll be waiting for you, Zenny Pirates!

236
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,320
Now, let's head back to
the island for a bit, shall we?

237
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,800
We have to fix the ship.

238
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,740
All right, everyone off. We're going back.

239
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,880
Age doesn't have anything to do
with becoming a pirate, huh?

240
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,150
My word, he knows how to get
an idea in someone's head.

241
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,940
Chopper is a patient one, too.

242
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:47,240
How many years will I need to
take this whole stack of medicine?

243
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,140
Much obliged, everyone. Very much obliged.

244
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,620
Thanks to you, I think I can
tough it out a little while longer.

245
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,670
After all, my life as a pirate has just begun!

246
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,750
Nice going, inviting them into
the foggy reef area, Luffy.

247
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,880
Sometimes, you do use your head, huh?

248
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,680
Huh? I do?

249
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,010
"I do"...? That's what I was asking you!

250
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,190
This is Moore's Fleet, calling any
ships sailing in this area of the sea!

251
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,660
This is Moore's Fleet!
Request immediate assistance!

252
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,880
Geez, you are such a moron!

253
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,550
I wish I hadn't complimented you! I take it back!

254
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,780
What?

255
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,160
It's not like he was thinking about that, huh?

256
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,380
Pure chance. He was just
pointing his finger wherever.

257
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,350
By the way, ship's doctor, how is it, really?

258
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,440
Gramps' condition?

259
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,220
That medicine controls his episodes, at best.

260
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,320
It won't keep him from getting any worse.

261
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,410
His heart was fairly weak to
begin with, and as old as he is,

262
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,220
sailing on a ship, let alone as a pirate...

263
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,800
What are you talking about?

264
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,710
The old man said he wanted to
be a pirate, so we should let him.

265
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,520
Besides, once the old man sets out to sea,

266
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,020
he may find an island that
has a cure for his illness.

267
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,340
Maybe.

268
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,160
We don't have to worry about it too much.

269
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,520
That old man isn't going to croak that easily.

270
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,820
His weak heart notwithstanding,
he did have plenty of guts, after all.

271
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,070
He's right, Chopper. We'll see him again!

272
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,020
Mm-hmm, sure we will.

273
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,830
We'll be waiting for you, Zenny Pirates!

274
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:17,690
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

275
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:27,900
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

276
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:43,630
There are days where I almost lose to myself

277
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:51,660
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

278
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:58,160
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

279
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:08,360
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

280
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:17,470
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

281
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,480
This unique moment...

282
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,010
An island! I see a lighthouse, too!

283
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,910
Then they've got something to eat!

284
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,900
Wow, it's incredibly tall, huh?
Is that really a lighthouse?

285
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,220
Never mind about that, let's hurry
and get something to eat!

286
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,930
Huh? Who are you, Pops?

287
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,680
Oh, not another weird old man!
I'm not taking care of this one!

288
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,150
"Legend of the Rainbow Mist!
Old Man Henzo of Luluka Island"

290
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,880
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
