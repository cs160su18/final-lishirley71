00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:19,080
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,550
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,190
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,310
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,110
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,740
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,860
Princess Vivi, in her attempt
to prevent any fighting,

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,980
arrived at the Yuba oasis, but the
rebel army was nowhere to be seen.

29
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,960
And, at long last, Baroque Works'
Officer Agents sprung into action.

30
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,690
The clash between the royal and
rebel armies is close at hand!

31
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,180
"Luffy vs. Vivi! The Tearful Vow
to Put Friends on the Line"

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,450
Excellent work today, my fellows!

33
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,900
So let's hit the hay for now and
regain our strength for tomorrow!

34
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,370
Nighty-night!

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,240
You've been sleeping this whole time!

36
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,470
Why, you...

37
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,450
Don't compare me with you monsters!

38
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,510
Now you've done it!

39
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,280
Besides, you win today's
laziness award, Blue-Nose!

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,210
It's not my fault I can't stand the heat!

41
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,750
Sanji-san. That's my--

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,040
Yes. I thought you might have a
hard time sleeping alone tonight...

43
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,180
And what do you think you're doing there?

44
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,130
Oh, that took some nerve.
Which one of you is spoiling for a fight?!

45
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,890
Do you guys not understand
the point of a nap?!

46
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,530
Alright! You're in trouble now!

47
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,150
Hey, old guy. There's still no
water. My throat's bone-dry...

48
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,910
How can you live in a place
like this? This is bad...

49
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,190
There'll be water.
The Yuba oasis is still alive.

50
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,860
Yuba, you see, can't be
beaten by some lousy sand!

51
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,950
I'll dig it back up
as many times as it takes!

52
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,930
This is very important land
that the king left in my hands.

53
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,670
Oh! Okay! Then let's dig!

54
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,730
Oh! Wait! Stop!
Don't re-fill the hole I just dug!

55
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,610
Are you trying to fill holes?!

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,270
No, I'm digging.

57
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,450
No, the sand you're digging out
is going into the hole I dug,

58
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,270
so I'm trying to say that all my
hard work will be for nothing!

59
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,780
Oh.

60
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,890
Oh! So it's a mystery hole!

61
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,680
No, it's not!

62
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,640
Come to think of it, the sand
has stopped flying this way.

63
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,600
All this, in such a short time?!

64
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,810
Even though he must be
exhausted from his long trek...

65
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,130
May you have a nice rest tonight.

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,810
Meat...

67
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,820
Pleasant dreams.

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,420
Gimme a break!

69
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,950
Just how long are you
going to make us wait?!

70
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,920
At least offer me an Octopar!

71
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,980
Don't make me dance! I'm a swan!
Don't make me spin around!

72
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,850
Mr. 2. Just wait quietly.

73
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,330
Seriously! You imbecile! Imb!

74
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,730
You too, Miss Merry Christmas.

75
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,730
You make my back hurt!

76
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,700
I guess there's no chance
of you all getting along.

77
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,070
Though that won't be necessary anyway.

78
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,150
Miss All-Sunday...

79
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,180
Thank you for coming all
the way to this gathering

80
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,870
in the town of Rainbase, where the
people dream of winning it big.

81
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,840
Welcome to Raindinners,
the largest casino of all!

82
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,480
Could you skip the formalities and
cut to the chase, Miss All-Sunday?

83
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Yes. I'll get right to the point.

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,580
Yeah! Get started! Started! Start!

85
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,910
But first, I'll need to introduce
you to our company's boss,

86
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,230
whose face you still don't know.

87
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,410
As his secret proxy, I've been the
one who's had you work until now,

88
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,820
but there is no longer any need for that.

89
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,910
I take it you understand...

90
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,770
At last, the time has come...

91
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,750
...for Operation Utopia.

92
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,550
Crocodile?!

93
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,510
This will be Baroque Works' final operation.

94
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,470
It would seem you know who he is...
at least on the outside, anyway.

95
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,080
Of course we do! But why one of
the Seven Warlords of the Sea?!

96
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,940
Talk about a real big shot!

97
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,260
We've actually been the
underlings of a pirate?!

98
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,120
You're our boss?

99
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,600
Dissatisfied?

100
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,730
Not exactly dissatisfied,
but the Seven Warlords are pirates

101
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,200
with government permission to plunder.

102
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,370
Why would you need to
own a company like this?

103
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,520
What I want is neither money nor status.

104
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,640
Military might.

105
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,850
Military might?

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,170
Allow me to explain in good order...

107
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,990
...my true objective

108
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,420
and the whole picture of
Baroque Works' final operation.

109
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,420
Something like that really
exists in this country?

110
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,250
And we're going to steal the
entire country along with it?

111
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,430
This is giving me such chills!

112
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,120
In short, these assignments of ours

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,380
are the final pieces of this enormous plan?

114
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,560
That's right.

115
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,270
Every job you've performed
since Baroque Works was founded

116
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,740
has been a part of this operation.

117
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,860
And those letters are your final orders.

118
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,990
At last the time has come for the
Alabasta Kingdom to disappear.

119
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,520
Once each of you has
fulfilled your mission,

120
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,100
this kingdom of Alabasta will wreck itself...

121
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,540
...and, with nowhere to go,
the rebel and royal armies

122
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,280
will tragically fall into
Baroque Works' hands.

123
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,060
In a single night, this land
will truly become our utopia.

124
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:24,480
Operation Utopia is Baroque Works'
last and greatest operation.

125
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,600
Failure is not an option.

126
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,880
We begin at noon tomorrow.

127
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,410
Understood!

128
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,940
I wish you luck.

129
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,000
I must ask that you hold off with
this Operation Utopia of yours.

130
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,650
Mr. 3. How did you get into
this secret underground room?

131
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,630
Mr. 3! Where the heck did
you come crawling out of?!

132
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,830
I'll get rid of you,
just like I was ordered to!

133
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,590
Wait, Mr. 2.

134
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,420
Crawling out of? How rude.

135
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,830
I merely stuck by your side
since the Spiders Café...

136
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,010
...as I took a ride on Bunchi's car.

137
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,180
Nice to meet you, Boss.

138
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,020
I've humbly come here
to ask for another chance.

139
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,150
It was only natural that you
be sent to take my life, Mr. 2,

140
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,620
after I failed to accomplish
the task given to me.

141
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,490
That is why I changed course slightly

142
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,980
and headed for the Spiders Café,
where we agents are stationed.

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,450
Failed to accomplish your task?
What are you talking about?

144
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,360
You know. H-How I let the Straw
Hats and Princess Vivi escape...

145
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,260
Escape, you say?!

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,150
Are you saying they're still alive?!

147
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,780
What did you say on the Transponder Snail?!

148
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,470
Did you not say you took care
of the pirates and Vivi?!

149
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,090
Transponder Snail?
What are you talking about?

150
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,760
I never used a Transponder Snail
while on Little Garden.

151
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,660
What?!

152
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,780
Heya. You've called the Damn Restaurant.
You want reservations?

153
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,480
This isn't good.

154
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,290
So that's why the Unluckies
haven't returned from the island.

155
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,330
So, I assume you at least
got rid of one or two?

156
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,430
N-No, actually...

157
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,630
B-But there was an
inaccuracy with the information!

158
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,660
She actually had four pirate escorts,

159
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,770
and there-- and there was a
long-nosed man with them and--

160
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,100
Damn you!

161
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,170
Zero-chan! Come on,
explain what's going on!

162
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,750
None of it makes any sense!

163
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,490
I... I met them!

164
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,960
I ran into these guys on my way here!

165
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,500
What?!

166
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,250
Him! Him!

167
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,930
Her!

168
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,430
Him!

169
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,560
And him, right?!

170
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,350
And...

171
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,570
...this is Miss Wednesday,
who is this kingdom's Princess Vivi!

172
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,850
Meaning they were actually our enemy?!

173
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,080
Yes. They know my identity.

174
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,310
They will interfere with
the operation if left alone.

175
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,930
And Mr. 3.

176
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:02,270
It seems they have gained one person
and one animal, just as you say.

177
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,410
Setting the pet aside,
it seems we can safely assume

178
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,670
that Vivi and the other four
are already here in Alabasta.

179
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,850
Mr. 2. Make photographs of
the faces you just displayed.

180
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,740
B-But, Boss!

181
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,240
I swear that I will take care of that
crew and Vivi with my own two--!

182
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,530
Quiet, you damn fool!

183
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,490
Mr. 3...

184
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,650
Mr. 3!

185
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,120
Do you know why I gave you your rank?!

186
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:42,160
In terms of fighting skill alone,
even Mr. 4 outclasses you, Mr. 3!

187
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,500
It was because of the underhanded,
contemptible tenacity you have

188
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,520
for accomplishing your duties!

189
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,540
You've really let me down!

190
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,340
W-What is that?!

191
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,100
H-He's drying up!

192
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,150
W-Water...

193
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,220
Water...

194
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,940
Have all the water you want.

195
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,470
It's feeding time.

196
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,310
What is this place? Underwater?

197
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,580
I-It's almost like an aquarium...

198
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,210
A b-bananagator!

199
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,710
That runt's caused me much trouble...

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,740
He just doesn't know how to stay dead!

201
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,670
Listen, now! Take a good look at these five!

202
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,740
They're bent on stopping the rebellion.

203
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,190
If we leave them alone,
eventually they will come to us!

204
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,250
But, Zero-chan.

205
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,950
Even if she is the princess,

206
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,670
do you really think she can stop
the rebellion at this point?

207
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,360
Unfortunately, the rebel leader
Koza and Princess Nefertari Vivi

208
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
are apparently close childhood friends.

209
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,230
It's a swell of 700,000.

210
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,600
Even if it can't be easily stopped,

211
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,920
she can bring confusion to the rebel army.

212
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,520
I've already had many
Billions join their ranks.

213
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,080
The fact that there's
been no word from them

214
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,280
must mean they still haven't
taken any direct action yet.

215
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,550
Whatever the cost,

216
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,990
Vivi and the rebel army must
not be allowed to make contact

217
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,320
before the operation.

218
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,770
Miss All-Sunday.

219
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,490
Yes?

220
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,970
Given the circumstances, I don't
mind using Transponder Snails.

221
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,960
Contact the Billions in Nanohana.

222
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,690
Tell them to kill them on sight!

223
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,760
Do not let Princess Vivi
and the pirates into Katorea!

224
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,760
Vivi and Koza must not be allowed to meet!

225
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,110
Yes. Right away.

226
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,760
Now you get going, too! You don't
want to be late for the party!

227
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,800
Our utopia is near at hand.

228
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,960
I don't want any further trouble.

229
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,410
Please leave it to us, Boss!

230
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,220
You can count on us!

231
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,210
Go enjoy yourselves!

232
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,220
I'm sorry for being so unseemly, Vivi-chan.

233
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,120
No, you're not unseemly at all!

234
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,260
Well, we should be off!

235
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,680
Oh, Luffy-kun. Take this with you.

236
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,660
Wow! Water!

237
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,960
Water!

238
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,720
You found some?!

239
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,570
Last night, just after you
fell asleep while digging,

240
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,430
I reached a moist layer of sand.

241
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,340
That water is the moisture
I managed to extract from it!

242
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,360
Oh! That sounds kind of
complicated, but thanks!

243
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,870
It's genuine Yuba water!
I'm sorry it's all I could get...

244
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,560
I'll drink it with care!

245
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,770
Luffy! What're you doing?!

246
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,680
Luffy?

247
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,900
What's wrong, Luffy-san?

248
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,850
I quit.

249
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,080
Huh?

250
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,860
You "quit"?

251
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,330
Luffy-san... What do you mean?

252
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,150
C'mon, Luffy!

253
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,930
We don't have time to put up with
your whims, you know! Get up!

254
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,700
Aren't we going back?

255
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,460
Yeah.

256
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,480
If we don't go back to Katorea the
way we came and stop the revolt,

257
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,520
a million citizens here are gonna
clash and things'll get ugly quick!

258
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,100
This is for Vivi-chan! Now let's go!

259
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,350
That's boring.

260
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,110
Say what?!

261
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,060
Vivi!

262
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,540
Yes?

263
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,860
I wanna kick Crocodile's ass!

264
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,690
If we stop the people rebelling,
will that stop Crocodile?

265
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,340
Besides, we won't be able to
do anything in Katorea anyway.

266
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,180
We're pirates, you see. Things
are better off without us around.

267
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,210
He can really get straight to the
point without thinking sometimes...

268
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,520
Despite being Luffy.

269
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,130
T-That's--!

270
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,890
You want it so nobody dies in this fight.

271
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,850
None of the citizens, and none of us!

272
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,330
Even when we're up against
a Warlord of the Sea

273
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,990
and a million people are going wild,

274
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,250
you hope everyone will stay safe and sound.

275
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,830
Don't you think that's too soft-hearted?

276
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,710
Hold on, Luffy! At least show
some sympathy for Vivi!

277
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,010
Wait, Nami-san.

278
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,050
But...

279
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
And what's wrong with thinking that?

280
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,810
What's wrong with not
wanting people to die?!

281
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,680
People die.

282
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,540
Stop talking like that!

283
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,110
Say that again and I'll make you pay!

284
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,900
That's exactly what
we're trying to stop here!

285
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,470
The rebel army, the royal army,
and the people of this kingdom

286
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,020
haven't done anything wrong!

287
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:05,160
So why do people have to die
when it's all Crocodile's fault?!

288
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,430
Then why are you putting
your life on the line?!

289
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,990
Whoa, Luffy! You're going too far!

290
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,150
Damn it, Luffy!

291
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,760
Just one look at this kingdom
and even I can tell...

292
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,470
Tell what?!

293
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,060
...what most needs to be done!

294
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,090
Yuba, you see, can't be
beaten by some lousy sand!

295
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,960
As if putting your single life
on the line is enough!

296
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,240
Then what should I be putting on the line?!

297
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,330
I can't let him get away with this!

298
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,810
I don't have--!

299
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,650
I don't have anything else
that I can put on the line...

300
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,380
At least try putting all of our
lives on the line together!

301
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,080
Aren't we friends?!

302
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,590
Aren't we friends?

303
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,030
Oh, you can cry those kinds of tears...

304
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,350
We will stop the rebellion!

305
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,540
I know you actually hate this
and want to beat him up the most!

306
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,060
Now tell me...

307
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,080
...where Crocodile is!

308
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

309
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,990
I continue on to the ends of emotion

310
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:38,630
I scoop up my hands, and the sand
and time that spills from them

311
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:45,670
show me that this is what
I was born to do

312
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:57,820
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

313
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:08,460
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

314
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,670
no one knows about

315
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,550
Eh?! The Navy's chasing them!

316
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,120
So why are they running this way?!

317
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,920
Say! Tony-kun hasn't come back yet!

318
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,550

319
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,290
The Navy's here!

320
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,460

This isn't good!
Baroque Works is gonna spot us!

322
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,330
