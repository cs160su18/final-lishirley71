2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,780
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,570
Luffy was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

61
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,330
There is, however, an untold
story of the brothers...

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,960
...10 years ago in the East
Blue - Luffy and Ace as boys.

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,130
"Freedom Taken Away! The Nobles'
Plot Closing in on the Brothers!"

64
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,000
There it is! A storm is coming!

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,230
We're ready for it! Bring it on!

66
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,500
Oh, cool! It's getting windier and windier!

67
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,230
Luffy, hold on to the flag!

68
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,460
It's uncool for pirates to
have their flag blown away!

69
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,000
Alright! Come on, wild wind!

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Come on, violent storm!

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,290
Bring it on, you bastard!

72
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,800
Here it comes!

73
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,420
--Luffy!
--Luffy!

74
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,210
You okay?!

75
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,530
Help me!

76
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,680
What are you doing, Luffy?

77
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,360
Stop laughing and help me!

78
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,530
Cool! We survived the storm!

79
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,200
But the hideout's been destroyed.

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,630
Okay, let's go and collect materials.

81
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,680
I want a telescope.

82
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,700
You'll never find that kind
of thing there, stupid.

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,790
I'd rather find a cannon.

84
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,830
It'd be cool if we could find one!

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,050
It's no good, Ace. I can't find a telescope.

86
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,840
Luffy, we're not here for a telescope.
Look for building materials.

87
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,180
Maybe this is enough.

88
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,940
It's a telescope! Luffy's gonna be so happy.

89
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,650
Hey, boy!

90
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,720
I didn't know that one of
the three infamous brats

91
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,700
was from a noble family.

92
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,790
Bluejam! How did you know?

93
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,790
Alright, guys. But don't leave a mark on him.

94
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,420
Do you wanna fight?!

95
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,700
Ace! Luffy!

96
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
--I feel dizzy...
--You okay, Sabo?

97
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Yeah!

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,140
If the three of us fight together,
we can easily beat these fools!

99
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,860
That's right! We even beat
the big tiger of Mt. Corvo!

100
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,100
You little shits!

101
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,280
Let's just finish this up
by killing their captain!

102
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,240
Okay!

103
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Damn!

104
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,870
Alright, brats, don't move!

105
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,060
I'm not afraid of that!

106
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,730
--Damn! Let me go!
--You bastard!

107
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,270
Go away! Or I'm gonna kick your butt!

108
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,730
Let me go, you bastard...

109
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,790
I barely made it in time.

110
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,290
Dad!

111
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,000
We didn't harm a hair on him, mister.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,720
Hey!

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,130
--Damn! You...!
--Sabo!

114
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,720
He wanted to find me so
badly that he hired pirates?

115
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,220
So they are the ones who
tempted Sabo into evil.

116
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,580
Give him back!

117
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,560
What do you mean "give him
back"? Sabo is my son.

118
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,440
Kids have to live as their parents say

119
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,820
because the parents brought
them into the world.

120
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,940
How dare you two tempt Sabo to run away!?

121
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,410
You thug-wannabe brats!

122
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,740
Are you after my money?!

123
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,080
What did you say?!

124
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,040
Hey, pirate! Be careful about hitting a kid!

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,670
I've got that trashy kid's blood all over me!

126
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,380
Ace!

127
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,630
Ack! Hey!

128
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,010
Stop it! Nobody tempted me!

129
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,730
I ran away of my own will!

130
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,720
You stay out of this! Hey.

131
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,100
I'll leave the rest up to you, pirates.

132
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,020
Of course, mister. You've
already paid us for this.

133
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,840
We will take care of these two so
they won't bother your boy again.

134
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,280
Wait a minute, Bluejam!
Dad, that's enough! I understand!

135
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,240
What do you understand?

136
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,460
Don't do it, Sabo!

137
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,130
I'll do as you say. I'll
live as you want so...

138
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,840
...please don't hurt these two!

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm begging you.

140
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,850
They're very important to
me,  they're my brothers.

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
Sabo...

142
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,980
Then go home right now.

143
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,690
You should stop playing pirate.
It's just a waste of time.

144
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,700
Hey! Don't go!

145
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,270
Be quiet!

146
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,450
Sabo, run! You don't have to worry about us!

147
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,330
You said you wanna live freely with us!

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,830
Sabo, don't go!

149
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,750
Are you gonna put an end to your dream?!

150
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,800
Sabo!

151
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,880
Sabo!

152
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,030
Sabo!!

153
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,690
Captain! What should we do with these kids?

154
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,400
--Take them to our hideout.
--Yes, sir.

155
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,800
You bastard! Untie me!

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,080
Fight me again! I'm not gonna lose this time!

157
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,500
Be quiet!

158
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,920
Why did you bring us here?!

159
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,880
It must be nice to be a noble,
don't you think so, brats?

160
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,720
They look down on others as if they're
trash and boss everyone around.

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,640
It's such an easy life.

162
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Don't you think it's nice?

163
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
What are you getting at?!

164
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,770
Being a pirate is way better!
That's what Sabo said!

165
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm feeling bad for you
guys. Hey, untie them.

166
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,820
Yes, sir.

167
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,440
Why do you think a kid from a noble family

168
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,780
escaped to a place like Gray Terminal?

169
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,960
He did it as a mockery of the people
here just like noble adults do.

170
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,500
I bet he was looking down on you guys, too.

171
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,880
That's not true! Sabo wouldn't do that!

172
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,220
He's right! We're brothers!

173
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,150
Yeah? Alright, I'm sorry.

174
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,770
But you're not gonna bother
that brat, are you?

175
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,700
If you're planning on doing that,

176
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,650
I'd
have to kill both of you right here.

177
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,440
If you think of him as your brother,
it's best to leave him alone.

178
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,780
For Sabo's good?

179
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,570
But Sabo hates the High Town!

180
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,370
You have to let go of him if
you really care about him.

181
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,120
You'll understand when you get older. And...

182
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
I had an axe to grind with you
about what you did to Porchemy

183
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,920
but we can forget about it. I rather
liked your show of strength.

184
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,510
That's why I wanted to ask you something.
I think you might be interested.

185
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:51,020
I'm short-handed now.
Do you guys wanna work for me?

186
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Well, it's an easy task.
It's not dangerous at all.

187
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,940
There is a map of Gray Terminal.

188
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,160
And you just have to carry packages
to the locations marked on the map.

189
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,490
Do you wanna do it?

190
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,860
Alright.

191
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,330
How much will you pay?

192
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,130
Ace, I don't like it when Sabo is not around.

193
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,050
Live with it. I don't like it,
either. I wanna rescue Sabo.

194
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,650
But I don't know what is really best for him.

195
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,470
Let's see how things go. He's fine.

196
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,640
If he can't take it there,
he can just come back.

197
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,240
Let's make some money for the
pirate savings for that occasion.

198
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,900
I can't say it. It's not
Ace and Luffy's fault.

199
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,910
Why can't you tell the truth?!

200
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,410
Is it because they warned
you not to say anything?

201
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,870
They're not those kinds of people!

202
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,960
If you have a criminal record, it
damages your family's reputation

203
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,800
and you can't enter High Town.

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,210
You were tempted by those two,

205
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,050
having no choice but to
get involved in violence,

206
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,040
weren't you, Sabo?

207
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,060
Sabo.

208
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,400
The fate of your friends in the Gray Terminal

209
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,310
is in the hands of those pirates.

210
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,490
And I can give them an order.

211
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,430
If they're that important to you,

212
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,860
think about what you have to do.

213
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,120
You're a smart boy.
You know what you should do.

214
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,540
You promised that you wouldn't hurt them!

215
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,170
That's why I came back here!

216
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,840
A crime is a crime! We did
it of our own free will...

217
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,430
Honestly!

218
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,020
It's so sad to have such a stupid son!

219
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,270
Can't you understand my dilemma?

220
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,520
Oh, it must be so hard.

221
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,030
I'll take care of the papers.

222
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,460
Welcome back, sir.

223
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,840
Okay, Sabo, let's go. It's been
a long while since you left.

224
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,550
Oh, don't go in yet - you're filthy.

225
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,410
Wash and disinfect your
body in the yard first.

226
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,350
Then take a bath.

227
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,690
I'm glad that you're safe, young master.

228
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, Sabo! You're back. You got bigger.

229
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,400
Mom.

230
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,240
Now Stelly, say "hi" to your older brother.

231
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,330
Nice to meet you, brother!
My name is Stelly and I'm 8.

232
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
Who is he?

233
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,540
We adopted him. He's a smart
boy from a noble family.

234
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,880
But for some reason, his
parents became negligent.

235
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,320
And we took him in since
he's full of promise.

236
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,070
If you don't work out to be my successor...

237
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,440
No, I'm telling you too much.

238
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,920
Go to your room now.

239
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,940
You have to start studying tomorrow.

240
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,030
Are you gonna put an end to your dream?!

241
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,710
Hey, brother! I heard that
you're pretty stupid.

242
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,880
Mother and father were always
saying that behind the curtain.

243
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,780
But you have the devil's luck

244
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,630
'cuz they're gonna take care of
the burnables tomorrow night.

245
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,250
If you had stayed in the Gray Terminal,

246
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,320
you would've died tomorrow.

247
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,390
Well, it would've been better for me

248
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,480
if their real son didn't come home...

249
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,360
W-W-What are you doing?! I'll tell father!

250
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,210
What were you talking about?!

251
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,410
What's going on? Tell me everything!

252
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,500
Th-There's gonna be a fire in
the Gray Terminal tomorrow.

253
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,100
--A fire?!
--Yeah.

254
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,310
You don't know about
it because you weren't here.

255
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,880
But they decided it months ago.

256
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,400
Did you know that the World Government

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,180
has sent a group of observers
to go around the East Blue?

258
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,370
They're gonna arrive in Goa
Kingdom finally 3 days from now!

259
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,810
And they have a World Noble,

260
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,960
a Celestial Dragon with them
so people are panicking!

261
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,070
The members of the royal family
don't want him to see our stigma,

262
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,160
so they decided to burn
down the Gray Terminal.

263
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Then this country will be clean!

264
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,370
What are you talking
about? That's impossible!

265
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,080
There are a lot of people living there!

266
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,460
They can't take away their home!

267
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,160
Let go of me!

268
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,710
Weren't you listening to me?

269
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,550
They're gonna burn up all
the shame of this country.

270
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,430
You mean, the people, too?

271
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,190
H-Hey!

272
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,820
Where are you going?

273
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,990
You can't just jump down...

274
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,580
I-It is not my fault.

275
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,080
It's a lie! He must be lying!

276
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,580
It's not possible to burn
down an area so large!

277
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,160
They were from this afternoon...

278
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,310
Are we ready for tomorrow?
There can't be any miscalculation.

279
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,220
We're ready but the unknown
factor is the pirates.

280
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,230
They have to burn the trash precisely.

281
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,320
Bluejam's clan is setting
boxes of oil and explosives...

282
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,280
...all over the Gray Terminal up
until the appointed time tomorrow.

283
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,980
Bluejam has a hand in this?
Then it must be true!

284
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,830
But it's so ridiculous!

285
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,450
I wonder how's Sabo doing.

286
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,600
Shut up and go to sleep.

287
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,780
We agreed to let go of Sabo for now.

288
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,890
Alright.

289
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,260
This could be better for him.

290
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,050
Sabo...

291
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,570
Luffy!

292
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,790
Telescope...

293
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,450
I can figure out if there'll be a fire or not

294
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,390
by the look of people in the town.

295
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,110
--Hi, good morning!
--Good morning!

296
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,570
--Isn't it a lovely morning.
--Yes, it is.

297
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,660
Oh great! There is nothing wrong!

298
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,620
I'll walk around the town.

299
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,850
Tomorrow morning should be
more lovely, shouldn't it?

300
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,630
Yes, it should.

301
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,180
Everything seems normal as usual.

302
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,010
Today is windy.

303
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,340
Yes, indeed, your Majesty.

304
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,610
Accidents could easily happen on a
day like this - especially fires.

305
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,280
You're right, your Majesty.

306
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,450
Sabo is not in the house?!

307
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,560
He's such a spoiled brat!

308
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,720
He still wants to keep playing
pirate without studying?!

309
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,250
Search the whole town!

310
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,080
He can't have gotten out
of the town so easily!

311
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,250
--Excuse me, mister.
--What do you want?

312
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,570
Do you know that there'll be a
fire in the Gray Terminal tonight?

313
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,430
Of course, I know. What about it?

314
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,180
He knows?

315
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,770
Which family are you from?

316
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,640
So it's true!

317
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,680
Hey, kid!

318
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,910
What's going on here?
Everybody knows about it?

319
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,740
They all know about it and
they're acting normally?!

320
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,920
Doesn't anyone care about the
fire in the Gray Terminal?!

321
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,410
Oh, there you are, you brats.

322
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,670
Do you want us to carry the boxes?

323
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,080
Yeah, and there will be a
big task for you tonight.

324
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,710
I'll tell you later.

325
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,670
Dad knows about it, too.

326
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,680
That's why he brought me
back - before the fire.

327
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,200
Because he wants me to maintain their status

328
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,440
and inherit their property even
though he thinks I'm a fool!

329
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,090
Oh, sorry if my dog is bothering you.

330
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,780
You're out of breath. What's the matter, boy?

331
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,760
It's nothing.

332
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,830
Yeah? Okay.

333
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,130
D-Do you know that there'll be a
fire in the Gray Terminal tonight?

334
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,290
Yes, I know.

335
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:06,490
Why doesn't anyone in this town
including you look concerned?

336
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,550
Why does no one try to prevent it?

337
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,140
You sound like you're a kind boy.

338
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,810
But, listen carefully.

339
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,150
We all have to keep quiet about the plan!

340
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,990
What if someone outside the
town finds out about it?

341
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,450
We're special! If you're
from a noble family...

342
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,990
Hey, you!

343
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,950
Ace! Luffy!

344
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,960
There's something wrong
with this town! Everybody's crazy!

345
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,270
Even though they know that
people will die soon,

346
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,960
they act normally and even smile!

347
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,130
I don't wanna stay here!
I gotta tell them quickly!

348
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,560
Today of all days, it's windy!

349
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,180
There he is! Isn't it him?!

350
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,700
There's no doubt! That's the runaway boy!

351
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,900
Hey you, stop!

352
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,460
The people in this country
are planning to burn up

353
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,570
their national shame tonight!

354
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,950
You have to get out of the
Gray Terminal! Ace! Luffy!

355
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,990
Run! Ace! Luffy!

356
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,470
After learning the secret
behind the fire outbreak,

357
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,320
Luffy and Ace are pushed into
dire straits by Bluejam.

358
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,510
Sabo rushes into Gray Terminal to save them,

359
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,120
but the intensely burning flames

360
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,770
are about to devour Luffy and Ace!

361
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

362
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,060
"The Fire Has Been Set!
The Gray Terminal in Crisis!"

363
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
