00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,420
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,690
What's the matter, Usopp?

24
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,270
The money... The money is gone!

25
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,190
Whaaat?!

26
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,440
Ahh! Over there!

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,950
Thanks for the money!

28
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,450
Hold it!

29
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,950
We did it!

30
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,410
Hold it!

31
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,540
The Franky Family...

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,840
Those bags... They're ours...!

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
Money! Money!

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,100
"Galley-La Company! A Grand Sight, Dock #1!"

35
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,970
Hold it, Paulie!

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,350
Today, I'm not
gonna let you get away!

37
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,060
I'm saying, wait a bit longer!

38
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,770
Who's that?

39
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,730
That's Paulie.

40
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,150
He's being chased by debt collectors again.

41
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,820
--Give us our 200 million Berries back!
--Sorry, mister! Thanks for giving us the money!

42
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,410
--Hey!
--Goodbye!

43
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,660
Did you give them the money?!

44
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,620
Why would I do that?! They stole it!

45
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,580
What?!

46
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,210
Pay back the money!

47
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,840
Like I said, I don't have money today.

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,760
That's not gonna cut it!

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,300
They're really persistent!

50
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,220
Hm? This is perfect! I see Yagara bulls!

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,810
Rope... Action!

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,060
--Ahhh!
--He's one of the shipwrights at Galley-La!

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,360
Sorry, but I'd like to borrow
one of your Yagaras for a bit!

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Round Turn!

55
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,720
Dammit! He got away again!

56
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,180
Well then, everyone, take care!

57
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,180
Let's run together again!

58
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,650
Dammit!

59
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,070
Seriously... you came at just the right time!

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,030
What a relief! He's one of
your shipwrights, right?

61
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,780
That's right.

62
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,200
Hey! Thanks!

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,330
That money belongs to us!

64
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,000
What? Money?

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,330
Oh, this...

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,470
Hello...! Hm? Hey!

67
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,430
Come back here!

68
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,010
That son of a bitch!
I'm gonna catch him--! Huh?

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,810
I'll go.

70
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,770
What? A... A pigeon?

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,490
This must be a guy's room.

72
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,160
At first glance, it looks tidy, but...

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,370
The floorboards have to be replaced, too.

74
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,880
Hey, what're you doing?

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Hm?

76
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,060
Don't worry. I'll put it back once
I check beneath the floorboards.

77
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,640
--Oh, my...
--Hm?

78
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,770
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Hey, hey, let me go!

79
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,770
What the hell are you doing?!

80
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,740
I won't run! I'm saying I got it, aren't I?!

81
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,240
Let go of my ear!

82
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,830
Here I was lucky enough to
find a lot of money and now...!

83
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,620
You'll regret this, Lucci!

84
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,120
Don't pay back your debts with
someone else's money, you fool!

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,880
I found this money!

86
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,920
You're still saying that?! Coo coo!

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,670
It just happened to be on
the Yagara that I borrowed!

88
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,340
They're back.

89
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,010
Well, I'm happy for you, Usopp!

90
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,390
You talk like it was someone else's problem!
It's our 200 million Berries!

91
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,020
That's right! Why the hell weren't
you the first one to go get it back?!

92
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,570
But that pigeon said he'd go.

93
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,490
Well... I'm sorry.

94
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,200
Please let us take care of our idiot coworker,

95
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,740
as if you guys were to capture him,
it would create bitter feelings.

96
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,200
Well, please excuse him. Consider it good that
the money wasn't stolen by the Franky Family.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,120
Hmm... That's true, but...

98
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,460
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

99
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Say... who were those
weird-looking guys earlier?

100
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,090
The Franky Family is a group
of ship demolition workers.

101
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,060
Demolition workers? They didn't look
like such decent craftsmen, though.

102
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,390
Right. They're also bounty hunters on the side.

103
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,820
Every time they find pirates coming
through this city, they cause quarrels.

104
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,530
They're a public nuisance.

105
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,530
If they crush the pirates who come to our town,

106
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,200
they can take their ship, too, right?

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,620
They demolish the ship
and sell the useable lumber.

108
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,540
That's how their business works.

109
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,750
How bad-natured...! Are they trying to
completely wipe the pirate groups out?

110
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,710
Well, if you become their victims,
not even your bones will remain.

111
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,460
But they didn't look that strong.

112
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,550
They're just underlings.

113
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,390
Whatever you do, don't underestimate the
family's boss, Franky, who's behind them.

114
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,810
Dammit! We were a little too late!

115
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,980
Hey! Are you okay?!

116
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,230
Yeah... That was close.

117
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,150
Hey! Where are the Straw Hats?!

118
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,610
Th-They're probably still at Dock #1.

119
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,160
We brought him over, Iceberg-san.

120
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,290
You're doing it again! You're hurting my ear!

121
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,340
Thanks, Lucci.

122
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,550
We're sorry that that idiot caused you trouble.

123
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,130
Ahh! He spoke again!

124
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,550
Coo coo!

125
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,680
Ow!

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,510
Now, apologize to them, Paulie!

127
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,720
That pigeon is doing all the talking!

128
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,810
It's as if he's speaking for that man with a hat.

129
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,770
In any case, I'm glad we got the money back.

130
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,570
Hey, you're the owner of the money?

131
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,480
I picked it up for you.

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,780
Oh, thanks!

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,240
If you wanna thank me, then give me 10%.

134
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,740
Sorry, mister.

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,500
This guy racked up a gambling debt,

136
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,210
so he's greedy and has no manners.

137
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,750
So, why the heck are you talking?!

138
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,050
You bastard! You're really
running your mouth, Lucci!

139
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,340
I won't take it anymore!

140
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,640
Rope Action!

141
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
Coo coo!

142
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,220
Bowline Knot!

143
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,690
Punishment...

144
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,480
Ahh...

145
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,240
Wait! Oh, no! He's serious!

146
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,700
...Pole-and-Line Fishing!

147
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,470
...Pole-and-Line Fishing!

148
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,730
I-Is he okay?

149
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,690
Well... it's nothing new.

150
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,270
Whoa! L-L-Look at that!

151
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,150
He's parried that impact with just one arm!

152
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,830
His fingers are sinking into the ground.

153
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,750
Wh-What the heck kind of fingers does he have?

154
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,130
What's with the shipwrights working here?

155
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,550
Hey! You, with the goggles!

156
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,590
Hm?

157
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,010
Hey, think about it carefully.

158
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,850
The one who mocked or
provoked you was that pigeon!

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,650
That's fine! The one who hit me was Lucci!

160
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,030
The pigeon can't hit you himself,
so he had that guy hit you!

161
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,860
Hey, pigeon!

162
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,240
If you wanna fight, fight yourself!

163
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,580
Say something!

164
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,170
Coo coo!

165
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,380
Oh? You wanna fight? Bring it on, you bastard!

166
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,300
Stop it, Paulie.

167
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,220
Coo coo. Well, sorry for the fuss.

168
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,720
I'm Rob L... No, I mean, Hattori the pigeon.

169
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,640
And this is Rob Lucci. He works here.
Nice to meet you. Coo coo!

170
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,020
Oh? He almost introduced
himself as if he were human!

171
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,530
A-ha! Yeah, I got it!
That's ventriloquism, isn't it?!

172
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,860
Whoa! Seriously?! Then it
was you who was complaining!

173
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,950
You're really, really good! I didn't notice!

174
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,990
Stop it. It's no big deal. Coo coo.

175
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,080
He's a weirdo who can't talk to people properly.

176
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,880
Wait a sec! What's with that woman?!

177
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Wh-What?

178
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,430
You're shameless!

179
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,840
Huh?

180
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,600
You're showing your legs too much!

181
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,060
This is a workplace for men!
Look how you're dressed!

182
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,360
Now, Paulie, calm down.

183
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,360
You, too, Kalifa!

184
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,820
You haven't learned your lesson and are
wearing such outrageous clothes again!

185
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,240
How many times do I have to tell you?!
Wear pants! Long pants!

186
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,580
--What the heck...?
--Long pants...?

187
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,460
He's a weirdo, too!

188
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,210
Well, that's it. Let's open the
door and go inside already.

189
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,440
At any rate, what a huge door!
And this requires manual operation?

190
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,520
Can those two weirdos open it by themselves?

191
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,780
Whoa! It's moving!

192
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,860
Well... each dock has only
five shipwright foremen.

193
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,990
They may not look like it, but their
skills made them foremen at Dock #1.

194
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,410
Kaku, who we talked about earlier,
is one of them, too.

195
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,040
This is a world where craftsmen's
skills are all that matters.

196
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,090
Even if their personalities are weird,
don't worry about it.

197
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,210
Yeah, they're weird.

198
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,960
Ah, the door's started opening.

199
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,340
Don't let the money leave your hands.
I don't think we have thieves inside, but...

200
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,680
Well, it was also my fault earlier,
and it caused you trouble, too.

201
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,020
--Hey, Luffy!
--Huh?

202
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Make sure you guard me good!

203
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,980
Okay, got it. Leave it to me!

204
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,360
--I'm worried.
--Leave it to me!

205
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,150
This Dock #1 comprises the main
force of the Galley-La Company,

206
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,320
and it undertakes the most difficult work.

207
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,820
Here, come inside.

208
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,990
Wow!

209
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,410
Whoooa!

210
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,180
Whoooa! Huge!

211
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,430
A shipyard has a tremendous
impact when seen up close!

212
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,760
--Yeah!
--True!

213
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,060
Oh? They're building a
huge galleon! Whose is that?

214
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,650
It's full of craftsmen.

215
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,480
Now, this way.

216
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,400
Oh, it's Iceberg-san!

217
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,070
Hey! Boss is here!

218
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,700
Good morning, Iceberg-san!

219
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,040
Good morning!

220
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,660
Boss! Could you take a look at
how the outer panels turned out?

221
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,000
Sure! I'll come by later!

222
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,290
Good day, Iceberg-san!

223
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,590
Well... Hello, are things going well?

224
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,720
Yes, sir! They're going pretty well!

225
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,090
Whoa! Ice pops is quite popular.

226
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,060
Of course he is. In this city,
skills are all that matters.

227
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,270
On this island, shipbuilding was
well-developed from the start,

228
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,730
and seven shipbuilding companies
were competing with each other.

229
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,900
Meanwhile, he attracted craftsmen
with his genius shipbuilding skills.

230
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,990
Then he put those seven companies together

231
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,080
to form a company five years ago.
And that's this Galley-La Company.

232
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,000
His passion and skills in
shipbuilding have never changed,

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,210
and the craftsmen won't forget
their respect towards him.

234
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,420
And, because the craftsmen
are proud of their skills,

235
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,800
they never give in to pirates or authority.

236
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,590
This is that kind of place.

237
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,220
Hm?

238
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,890
Hey, pops. I heard that
you're a topnotch shipwright.

239
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,520
Do you wanna be a pirate with me?

240
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,640
What the hell are you saying,
you son of a bitch?!

241
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,890
H-How insolent!

242
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,270
Now, now... He's always like that.

243
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,360
Sorry about that.

244
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,490
Well... you guys don't even
have a single shipwright?

245
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,360
That's right. We came to this island
in order to have our ship repaired

246
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,070
and to find a new crew member.

247
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,950
It's true that we have tons of shipwrights,

248
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,870
but I wonder if anyone would
want to go on board a pirate ship.

249
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,580
If you find someone who wants to
go with you, you can headhunt him.

250
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,550
Really?! You're generous!
Can't I ask you to join us, pops?

251
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,630
Well... I can't. I'm the mayor.

252
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,390
Who cares?!

253
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,980
By the way, is the woman named
Nico Robin really on board your ship?

254
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,650
Yeah, she is. She's really smart.

255
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,690
What? Is something matter with Robin?

256
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,360
No...

257
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,860
Hey, pops, is it okay to go
closer and see that ship?

258
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,030
Sure, that's fine.

259
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,240
Thanks!

260
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,000
In any case, it's really amazing!

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,430
Keep that steady! Don't rush! Go slowly!

262
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,140
If we could install a cannon like that,
the Merry would also be... Hm?

263
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,430
Whoa! A demi-culverin!

264
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,350
How cool! It's so long...! And shining!

265
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,360
I wanna fire something like that, one time!

266
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,570
This is a good chance.

267
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,650
It looks like it's made of copper.
That must be expensive!

268
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,030
I wonder if they'd let me try firing it.

269
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,370
Oh, wait. We've now got 300 million Berries.

270
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,910
We should be able to buy
one or more cannons like that!

271
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,630
Hm?

272
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,260
Wasn't there someone there?

273
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,510
Where did Robin go?

274
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,390
It's this way.

275
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,610
Hm? This smell is...

276
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,990
I knew it!

277
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,790
Hmm... At any rate, who the heck was that
masked man who was with Robin-chan?

278
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,120
Was that Chopper after all?

279
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,500
Sanji!

280
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,540
Hm?

281
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,790
Chopper?

282
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,430
Hm? Kaku...

283
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,190
--Where have you been?
--An assessment.

284
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,060
Ah! You're the guy from earlier!
So you checked our ship?

285
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,360
Yeah, I did.

286
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,650
So you were here, Iceberg-san.

287
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,860
I know the situation. How was it?

288
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
Well...

289
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,410
Luffy! Come down now!

290
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
Okay! I'll be right down!

291
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,430
What?! Is that true?!

292
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,020
If you're lying, you'll pay for it!

293
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,860
I never lie on the job.

294
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,200
Hm? Where's Usopp?

295
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,710
He was wandering about over
there up until just a moment ago.

296
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,130
Hey, you guys! Don't these bags belong to you?

297
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,640
Ahh! They're the bags Usopp was carrying!

298
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,470
Yeah, they're ours.

299
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,600
Thanks!

300
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,850
Geez... Where did Usopp go...
leaving our precious money alone?!

301
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,770
--Money?
--Yeah. Those bags hold 200 million Berries.

302
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,900
200 million Berries?

303
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,740
No way. See ya!

304
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,200
There's no way...

305
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,250
So how much does it look like it'll cost?

306
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,750
We can pay as much as you like!
We've got tons of money!

307
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:01,630
If possible, I'd like her to be stronger,
have more cannons, and be faster!

308
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,760
Can you also add pretty
decorations on the outer panels?

309
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,140
Can you renovate inside as well?

310
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,600
Also, I want a bronze statue!

311
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I want it to be as huge as possible!

312
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,520
Well, hold on a sec...

313
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,320
You've been having some
tremendous journeys, haven't you?

314
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,740
Oh, yeah! We flew in the sky, and fell as well.

315
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,030
We climbed a mountain and got skewered.

316
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,950
We've gone through quite a bit!

317
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,500
So we'd like to have her fixed good!

318
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,790
I'm not lying, you know.

319
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,250
I believe it.

320
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:38,750
Hm?

321
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,970
Her scars from battle are too deep.

322
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,800
Do you mean it'll take
quite a long time to fix her?

323
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,470
No...

324
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,390
Frankly speaking, your ship...

325
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,230
...can no longer be fixed, even with our skills.

326
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Is her keel damaged or something?

327
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, it's taken a lot of damage.

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,250
Oh, no...

329
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,260
But we've been traveling
just fine up until today!

330
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,720
Let's suppose that we did
what we could anyway.

331
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,140
The probability of her
reaching the next island is...

332
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,100
...zero.

333
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,370
Merry... Can you really not...

334
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,750
...sail anymore?

335
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,070
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

336
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,610
Chasing after something constant

337
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,200
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

338
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,490
Even when we're exhausted

339
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,660
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

340
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,090
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

341
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,010
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

342
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

343
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,760
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

344
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,850
Eternally... Eternally...

345
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,640
Wild fantasies from our childhood

346
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,480
We trace unforgettable memories

347
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,150
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

348
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,990
To this familiar sunny sky

349
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,780
Together we entrust our feelings

350
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,370
We go beyond the changing time

351
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,000
Eternally... Eternally...

352
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,130
Hey, Merry... Can you really not sail anymore?

353
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,970
Just give up. The damage is too serious.

354
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,090
--Oh, no...
--All your ship can do is wait for her end.

355
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,220
--That can't be true...
--I can't believe that! We have this much money!

356
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,600
The 200 million Berries are gone!

357
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,890
Hey, Usopp is gone, too!

358
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,600
What? Don't tell me...

359
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,310
"Pirate Abduction Incident and a Pirate
Ship That Can Only Await Her End"

361
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
