The unchanging bond will light up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

Freedom is our only compass, We are best friends

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580
We will keep making our own route

The unchanging bond will light up the "end of the dream"

35

We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480
Everytime we overcome something,

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,100

Go along with your curiosity

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,310
and go wherever you want to go - that's the adventure

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,010

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa kitto "yume no hate" tsukamitoru

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,560
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,600
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,520
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,780
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,970
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,410
Meanwhile, Lightning Soldier and the

79
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,840
Tontatta Tribe are having a rally underneath Dressrosa.

80
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,810
"Operation Dressrosa SOP"!

81
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,870
One of Doflamingo's subordinates
turned us into toys.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,820
We have to knock out
this Hobby-Hobby Fruit eater!

83
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,660
--Hobby-Hobby Fruit?
--You can imagine what will happen then.

84
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,730
Oh! It will break the spell?!

85
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,600
That's right!

86
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,000
All the toys in Dressrosa will change back into
their human forms at once!

87
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,110
So if we can knock her out,
all the toys can change back?!

88
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,220
That's right!

89
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,860
We'll frighten her out of her wits
and make her pass out!

90
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,910
And that's Operation...

91
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,220
Sugar!

92
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,190
Oversurprised!

93
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,650
Panic!

94
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,220
Y-You are...

95
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,060
It's been a while!

96
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,570
I thought he died!

97
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,110
"Operation SOP Starts!
Usoland Charges Forth!"

98
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Ouch!

99
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,960
Are you still crying?!

100
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,450
Because...

101
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,610
I've never seen Luffy-dono crying like that.

102
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,500
He must be very happy to see that person alive.

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,160
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,350
I'm asking you! Who is that person?!

105
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,140
M-My brother!

106
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,500
Brother?!

107
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,750
What?! Luffy-dono has a brother?!

108
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,850
I thought your brother was "Fire Fist" Ace!
Are you saying he is alive?!

109
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,440
It brings back memories!

110
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,160
Answer my question!

111
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,930
When we become pirates,
we might not be on the same ship

112
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,230
but our brotherhood will always
be with us!

113
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,000
Wherever you are, whatever you do,
we'll always be bonded together!

114
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,030
So from now on,

115
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,020
we're brothers!

116
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,750
Ace was right!

117
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,250
We were always bonded together as brothers!

118
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,350
I said "Who is that"?!

119
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,990
THE KING RIKU ARMY HEADQUARTERS

120
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,800
Everybody! Are you ready?!

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,590
Yeah!

122
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,060
THE FLOWER FIELD
(THEIR PRESENT LOCATION)

123
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,560
We'll sneak into the port through the underground passage!

124
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,560
THE TRADE PORT

125
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,180
Our target is just one girl!

126
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,630
Sugar!

127
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,950
She's just a girl
but it's not gonna be easy!

128
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,190
We're gonna knock Sugar out

129
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,430
so all the toys in the country will change back to humans!

130
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,230
Yeah!

131
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:37,940
Free our captive Tontatta friends
and take Dressrosa back for King Riku!

132
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,900
Yeah!

133
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,040
We, Yellow Cub Squad, and...

134
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,750
We, Pink Bee Squad, will lead the way!

135
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,980
Let's go!

136
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,280
We're gonna go at high speed!

137
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,210
--It's finally starting.
--Yeah!

138
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,150
But this passage to the trade port is too...

139
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,340
...narrow!

140
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,750
Robiland and I can barely fit in.

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,820
What about me, then?

142
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,490
Fraland, why don't you take off your shoulders and arms?

143
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,860
Okay, let me take them off... I can't!

144
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,000
Hey, me-land can't go in there!

145
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,160
We weren't expecting big humans to use it when we made it.

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
You have to enter from the Toy House!

147
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,390
The Toy House is

148
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,270
located at the base of the plateau that the palace is on.

149
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,720
That's where the toys go back every night.

150
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,390
Humans aren't allowed to go in.

151
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,960
You call it a "house" because the toys live?

152
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,900
No, they just call it a "house."
There are no beds to sleep in, or anything.

153
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,300
Inside, there is only a passage into the ground.

154
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,670
A passage?

155
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,880
Every night, the toys go down underground

156
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,260
through the passage and work all night.

157
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,460
What?!

158
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,350
Doesn't that mean the toys in the town
are always exhausted?

159
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,120
Yes, indeed.
As are, the Tontatta people...

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,760
...who are forced to work!

161
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,290
I can't believe it! It's horrible!

162
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,070
A-Anyway, through that place,

163
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,710
Fraland can go down to the SMILE factory, right?

164
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,270
Yes. There are four entrances in four directions.

165
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,080
However, all the entrances are tightly guarded!

166
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,760
It's more exciting that way!

167
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,070
If I have to go there anyway,

168
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,090
I'll create havoc!

169
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,110
--What?
--Wh-Why do you wanna do that?

170
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,030
--Because it's better for you.
--What do you mean?

171
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,420
While I'm drawing their attention,
finish your business with Sugar.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,350
Hm? Who is that?

173
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,340
Swim briefs?!

174
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,260
What's wrong with his head?!

175
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,830
--Is it a weapon?
--Or is he just an idiot?

176
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,100
Oh! He's got two dimples on his chin!

177
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,810
There's no mistaking it!
He is Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hats!

178
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,360
--What?!
--You sure?!

179
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,730
Senor!

180
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,460
Oh, Senor! If you jam a tomato in your mouth  like that,

181
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,710
it's gonna be messy around there!

182
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,070
H-He's so...

183
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,230
...hard-boiled!

184
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,230
Stop climbing all over me, you little tramps!

185
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:43,030
SENOR PINK - AN EXECUTIVE
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY (THE DIAMANTE ARMY)

186
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,030
Go hang out with younger guys!

187
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,920
Don't say that, Senor!

188
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,420
Don't give me the cold shoulder, Senor!

189
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,770
I'm not into...

190
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,310
...fledglings.

191
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,480
Oh! Senor!

192
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,020
--Don't leave me, Senor!
--Senor!

193
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,500
Senor!

194
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,110
Who is that pervert?

195
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,870
You have no right to say that!

196
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,890
This is the east entrance of the Toy House!

197
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,150
The enemy's here!

198
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,450
You have to let me in!

199
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,420
Weapons Left!

200
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,390
S-Shoot him!

201
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,230
He's one of the Straw Hats -
Cyborg Franky!

202
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,970
Coup de...

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,470
...Vent!

204
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,300
See?

205
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,310
Those idiots are causing trouble.

206
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,900
I thought it's the Navy's duty to
save countries affiliated

207
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,660
with the World Government.

208
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,400
Excuse me for a while.

209
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,030
They've started, huh?

210
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,080
They're attacking the Toy House.

211
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,080
Don't worry!

212
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,380
The Straw Hats are going
for the SMILE factory.

213
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,600
If they make it this far, then...

214
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,720
Then?

215
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,030
Let's turn them all into toys, okay?

216
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,860
Uh-huh.

217
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,800
Nobody knows.

218
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,850
Nobody knows your existence, right?

219
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,370
I guess.

220
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,430
THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE

221
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,700
We're almost there at the trade port!

222
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,920
I feel bad.

223
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,010
You don't need to.

224
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,690
Helping our hero - Usoland is...

225
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,010
Our Honor!

226
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,050
Well...

227
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,930
Commander! Fraland started wreaking havoc at the Toy House!

228
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,990
Okay!

229
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,080
If I have to go there anyway,

230
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,610
I'll create havoc!

231
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,510
Is he gonna be okay?

232
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,110
Don't worry! He's a super cyborg!

233
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,460
But I just received notice that four of the executives

234
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,200
of the Family, are on guard of the Toy House!

235
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,550
E-Executives?!

236
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,720
They're the formidable Diamante Army!
A group of fighters!

237
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,790
Are they... pretty strong?

238
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,080
Their winning percentage in fighting events is 100%.

239
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,330
They're the big stars of the Colosseum!

240
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,840
100%?
That means they've never lost!

241
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,910
That's right! Which means...

242
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,920
...nobody knows
how strong they really are!

243
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,480
Good! Formidable as he is, Franky is unaware
that Senor is coming from behind!

244
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,750
What?!

245
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,570
Are you blind?

246
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,010
Huh?! How did you emerge
from the ground like that?!

247
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,570
Strong Right!

248
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,740
Why did he show up in front of the enemy voluntarily?!

249
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,010
Senor!

250
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,540
Why did I show up in front of the enemy?

251
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,610
The only thing that a man does
behind someone's back is...

252
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,060
...undress a woman.

253
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,560
Ah, Senor! So hard-boiled!

254
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,850
However,
a man stands in front of someone...

255
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,100
...only when he steals a kiss
from a woman.

256
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,270
Oh, I'm fainting...

257
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,410
Senor! You're the man!

258
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,780
You guys are super stupid, aren't you? Huh?

259
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,950
What kind of ability is that?!

260
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,760
How many key figures are there
in the Family, Leo?

261
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,760
10 executives currently lead 2000 subordinates
all over the country now.

262
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,320
And 3 top executives lead them,

263
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,010
each with their own unique army.

264
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,320
First, the Trebol Army

265
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,370
THE TREBOL ARMY
(A TEAM OF MEMBERS WITH SPECIAL ABILITIES)

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,790
has members with special abilities.

267
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,040
Sugar!

268
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,810
SUGAR

269
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,170
Violet!

270
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,280
VIOLET

271
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,210
Giolla!

272
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,850
GIOLLA

273
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,780
Next, the Diamante Army!

274
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,960
THE DIAMANTE ARMY (A GROUP OF FIGHTERS)

275
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,150
A group of fighters!

276
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,220
Lao G.!

277
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,130
LAO G.

278
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,290
Machvise!

279
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,030
MACHVISE

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,830
Senor Pink!

281
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,170
SENOR PINK

282
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,400
Dellinger!

283
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,300
DELLINGER

284
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,290
The last one is the Pica Army!

285
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,010
THE PICA ARMY (A COMMANDO UNIT)

286
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,690
A commando unit!

287
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,070
Gladius!

288
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,080
GLADIUS

289
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,230
Buffalo! Baby 5!

290
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,120
BUFFALO
BABY 5

291
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,080
We've seen Buffalo and Baby 5!

292
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,390
We know there are two others overseas.

293
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,680
VERGO - A TOP EXECUTIVE

294
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,980
A top executive - Vergo!

295
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,900
And an executive - Monet!

296
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,680
MONET - AN EXECUTIVE

297
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,850
Our target is Sugar, right?

298
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,320
Of the team of members with special abilities?

299
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,390
Uh-huh! That's right.

300
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,690
Then, we don't have to face the group of fighters!
Good luck, Franky!

301
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,650
But they're all pretty strong!

302
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,790
What?!

303
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,950
Give me a break!

304
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,270
Meadows is defeated!

305
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,490
Rebecca is taking down Block D's potential winners one by one!

306
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,880
She, and Agilia who is backing her up,
are really pissing off the crowd!

307
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,850
Now, who's gonna knock out Rebecca?!

308
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,790
Oh?! Can he stop her?!
Suleiman the Beheader!

309
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,600
Or are we gonna see Rebecca's Back-to-the-Water Dance again?!

310
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,430
Rebecca!

311
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,420
Whoa! He fended off
her Back-to-the-Water Dance!

312
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,900
Here we are!

313
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,070
I'm sorry, Usoland!

314
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,710
--Thank you.
--No, no, no.

315
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,320
We're here! This is the underground world

316
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,380
where the trade port and the factory are.

317
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Yeah?

318
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,910
It's kind of noisy here.

319
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,370
We're gonna head for the palace!

320
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,900
I'm gonna leave the other task up to you!

321
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,310
Yes, I got it!

322
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,490
Wait for me, Doflamingo!

323
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,280
I'll take you down even if it means death!

324
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,420
Is it from above ground?

325
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,450
Hey, who dropped the box?!

326
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,390
A toy's been buried under it.

327
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,090
I-I'm sorry!

328
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,990
I'll keep working,
just let me see my family!

329
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,740
Idiot! Those who can't meet their quota will get scrapped!

330
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,820
Take him!

331
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,990
W-Wait! I can still work!

332
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,860
Help!

333
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,590
Usopp.

334
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,720
Robin, I just...

335
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,840
Look.

336
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,040
What are you doing?!

337
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,410
If you don't like it, the deal is off!

338
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,230
You jerk! You're taking advantage of my weakness!

339
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,270
If only Joker weren't on your side...

340
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,700
What the hell is this?!

341
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,960
It's a massive port town!
