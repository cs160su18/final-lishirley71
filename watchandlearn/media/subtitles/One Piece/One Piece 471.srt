2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
To the future I believe in...

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,350
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,590
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,690
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,610
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,660
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,520
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,460
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,010
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,570
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

63
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,080
Luffy and the Whitebeards
are trying to get to the scaffold

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
but the Navy stands in their way.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,810
The battle is heating up!

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,060
Then suddenly, a group of
the Navy's human weapons -

67
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,910
the Pacifistas appeared!

68
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,940
Look at the bay head! There's something!

69
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,960
Wh-What are they?!

70
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,930
So that's the human weapon of
the Government that I heard of.

71
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,390
K-Kuma?

72
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,770
"The Extermination Strategy in Action!
The Power of the Pacifistas!"

73
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,840
The Warlord--Bartholomew Kuma!

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,550
How come there're so many Kumas?

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,820
What's going on here?

76
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,200
They're the ones who ran wild
here on the Sabaody a while ago!

77
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,460
There're a number of Bartholomew Kumas!

78
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,130
Now they've got way more of them!

79
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,750
Head Office! Head Office!

80
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,450
I have big news!

81
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,440
Hello? Hello?!

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,070
Is this the real one?

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,510
I've heard about it from time to time

84
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,180
that Dr. Vegapunk was trying
to build a human weapon

85
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,100
and was repeatedly sending
prototypes to various places.

86
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,440
So they're the human weapon?

87
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,920
Why do they all look like Kuma?

88
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,500
Uncle! Didn't everything
go as you guys planned?!

89
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,180
I heard that pirates were

90
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,220
going to be easily encircled
inside the bay when we came out!

91
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,390
But they're scattered all over!

92
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,400
The broad-axe guy is yelling something.

93
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,700
I see what the Navy is up to!

94
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,610
First, they leaked the information
that they moved Ace's execution

95
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,330
to make us rush.

96
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,760
Then they slowly backed up

97
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,340
and lured all the pirates
inside the bay, and...

98
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,900
...blocked the bay head with the
human weapons to close the trap.

99
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,390
Checkmate!

100
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,520
That's why Whitebeard said that

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,130
we should sink the Navy
ships around us first.

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,260
He saw it coming.

103
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,850
We didn't get trapped, thanks to him.

104
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,390
Yeah.

105
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,840
Even though we couldn't trap them,

106
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,230
we can go at them from
the front and the back!

107
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,740
Attack the allied pirates
first as we planned.

108
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,080
Get rid of the ones who
wander off of the enclosure!

109
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,880
Did you hear that?

110
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Uncle, is it okay if some Navy ships
get caught in the crossfire?

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,720
Keep it to a minimum.

112
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,680
Alright!

113
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,050
Let's begin!

114
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,160
I don't know what's going on but
you can't beat us that easily!

115
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,880
Oh... Oh no!

116
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,480
Go, Pacifistas!

117
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,290
He blew them away!

118
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,740
They're even willing to sacrifice their own.

119
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,260
Don't be afraid, guys!

120
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,750
Let's charge the plaza without stopping!

121
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,260
Backing down is not even an option.

122
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,870
I'll get to Ace before they get me!

123
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,810
Everyone, get off of the ship!

124
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,600
Counter the human weapons!

125
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,590
Come on.

126
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,710
I'll fight you!

127
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,980
All units, get off of the ice right away!

128
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,490
Don't let the pirates reach the plaza!

129
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,750
Fall back!

130
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,860
Hurry up!

131
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,500
I didn't expect that I'd get to fight the
world's greatest swordsman in this war.

132
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,190
How lucky I am.

133
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
You're the number one
swordsman of the Whitebeards.

134
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,750
Let me see the Flower Sword's swordsmanship.

135
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,280
You can have a good look at it.

136
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,780
Rose Rondo!

137
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,680
What kind of flower should I make bloom next?

138
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,160
Drive them in, Pacifistas!

139
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,860
I won't let you! Take this!

140
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,830
I got you!

141
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,770
What are they made of?!

142
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,290
They're not human!

143
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,520
Are they unbreakable?!

144
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,900
The picture...

145
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,230
No matter how much you struggle,

146
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,750
we will keep the upper hand, Whitebeard!

147
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,580
When all videos have been cut,
activate the encircling walls.

148
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,060
Thereupon, we will execute Ace
and round up all our enemies.

149
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,680
Yes, sir!

150
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,810
Outta my way!

151
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,530
Ace's in danger! I gotta hurry!

152
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,870
Go back to the beginning!

153
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,530
Luffy-kun!

154
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,480
Jimbei!

155
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,470
The admiral has come out!

156
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,020
Damn!

157
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,190
It's tough but we need to hurry!

158
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:00,530
We came here knowing that powerful
enemies would stand in our way!

159
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,470
Die, Dragon's son!

160
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,600
Ace's brother, are you out of energy already?

161
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,050
The commanders are here!

162
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,870
What a tremendous help!

163
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,440
You can't get blocked by just one guy!

164
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,380
Come with us!

165
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,850
Okay! That bastard!

166
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,180
The Navy is backing down
so now is our chance!

167
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,380
Let's break through at once!

168
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,290
That's kinda tough!

169
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,190
10th division commander--Curiel!

170
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,150
If you're gonna come for me,
I'll just knock you down!

171
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,020
You're dead if you stay inside the bay!

172
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,030
Ace will die and you guys
will be trapped and wiped out!

173
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,790
I couldn't care less about who's gonna win

174
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,110
but it'll nice to see Whitebeard to die!

175
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,450
I won't let Pops and Ace die!

176
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,720
Shall we put this match on hold, Vista?

177
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,260
Seems like it'd be good for both of us.

178
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,020
We're ordered to back down, Smoker-san!

179
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,830
We've got to go!

180
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,410
Yeah.

181
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,660
I know.

182
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,950
Straw Hat!

183
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,950
Luffy! Hurry up and save your brother!

184
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,180
Have you cut the videos yet?

185
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,780
No, give us another minute!

186
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,720
Hey, did you find it?!

187
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,350
N-No! We're still looking for it!

188
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,060
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

189
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,160
We're all set!

190
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,750
Gaffer, move aside.

191
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,810
They cut all videos except for one but...

192
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,080
Why do we have to wait?!

193
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,550
You're good to go on camera!

194
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,740
Okay, let's go on the air!

195
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,840
5 seconds to go!

196
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,410
4, 3, 2, 1, action!

197
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,490
The picture's back!

198
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,930
Er... Um...

199
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,640
Sorry to keep you waiting, everyone.

200
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,230
Somebody's talking!

201
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,040
We're here at Marineford.

202
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,270
There're dead bodies of pirates and the Navy.

203
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,860
A commentary?

204
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,580
Hey! What's this?! What's going on?!

205
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,670
Hmmm?! The guy over there must be...!

206
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,220
Oh, he's...! Don't tell me that he's...!

207
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,910
He's been hiding his origin but...

208
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,340
...he was one of the legendary crew of
the King of the Pirates--Gold Roger!

209
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,380
Who's that?

210
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,300
The great pirate--Captain Buggy the Clown?!

211
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,970
Yes, that's who I am indeed!

212
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,770
It's top secret but I am...

213
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,370
...the legendary pirate.

214
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,580
H-Hey! Captain Buggy!

215
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,180
Your nose is bleeding!

216
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,730
Cut! Cut!

217
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,010
Wipe it up!

218
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,090
What the hell is this?!

219
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm saying "cut the stupid video right away!"

220
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,860
We can't move on like this!

221
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,960
I-I'm afraid that...

222
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,110
...one of the Video Transponder Snails

223
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,530
has been stolen by the
prisoners from Impel Down!

224
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
What did you just say?!

225
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,370
Make-up!

226
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,850
We're ready!

227
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,400
Alright, now it's take 2!

228
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,890
3, 2, 1 and...

229
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,950
Oh! That guy right there!

230
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,150
He was one of Roger's legendary crew and...

231
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,740
...the sworn brother of "Red-Haired"
of The Four Emperors!

232
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,650
The great pirate--Captain Buggy the Clown?!

233
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,140
Yes, indeed!

234
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,310
Stop them right now!

235
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,650
Whoa! That was close!

236
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,430
They found us! Run!

237
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,480
You just got cut by the
famous "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk

238
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,600
but you don't seem like you got hurt at all!

239
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,610
Talking about me?

240
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,990
Yes, I'm Buggy!

241
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,480
The legendary!

242
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,220
Blow all of them away!

243
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,100
Let us see the war!

244
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,080
What happened to other videos?!

245
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,130
Let us see Ace who was about to be executed!

246
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,850
Let us see the group of Bartholomew Kumas!

247
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,130
They keep driving us to the corner!

248
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,470
Don't give up!

249
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,190
We can't go down until we save Ace!

250
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,610
Let's go!

251
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,350
Pops.

252
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,300
Squard!

253
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,290
I'm glad that you're alive!

254
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,190
Yeah, barely.

255
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,500
I see. I was calling for you a while ago.

256
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,030
How is it at the bay head now?

257
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,640
Your allies were beaten badly.

258
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,700
I made it here because
I found the way out luckily.

259
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,370
Sengoku has no mercy.

260
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,530
He's using all the forces he has
in order to defeat us.

261
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,130
Pops, did you notice what the Navy was up to?

262
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,140
I've known Sengoku for a long time.

263
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,060
I see.

264
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,420
It's better for us if they're
gonna attack us from the rear.

265
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,020
I'm gonna go forward, too!
We gotta invade without stopping!

266
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,060
I agree.

267
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,280
Squard? Why is he up there?

268
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,670
There are 43 allied captains here

269
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,370
and we are all in your debt beyond words!

270
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,660
We risk our lives for the Whitebeard Pirates!

271
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,900
Thank you.

272
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,630
But we are...!

273
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,860
I know.

274
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,220
You are fighting to save
a member of your family.

275
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,390
The pirate, Whitebeard,
won't give up on his family.

276
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,500
Everybody followed you to this hell
because you're that kind of person.

277
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,200
I wish that...

278
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,880
...we were also...

279
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,130
...members of your family.

280
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,250
No one expected Squard's betrayal.

281
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,090
As they see him approaching Whitebeard,

282
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,630
suspicion grows in the Navy men as well.

283
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,430
The strong bond shared among the
Whitebeard Pirates has been destroyed...

284
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,300
That is the scenario described by the Navy.

285
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

286
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,070
"Akainu's Plot!
Whitebeard Entrapped!"

287
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
