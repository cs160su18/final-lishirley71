2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,220
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,600
Huh?

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,190
Yahoo!

26
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,410
A-Are you all right?!

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,020
Yeah! It's okay, it's okay!

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,620
They're new recruits who heard
all about me and came from afar...

29
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,870
...to join the Usopp Pirates!

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,750
No, not me!

31
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm here to ask a favor!

32
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,430
A favor? Of me?

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,210
Yeah!

34
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,610
--We want a big ship...
--You, there!

35
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,290
What are you doing?!

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,340
Klahadore...

37
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,920
I don't appreciate you breaking
in here without permission!

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,580
Who's there?!

39
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,900
"The Weirdest Guy Ever!
Jango the Hypnotist"

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,510
A-Actually, Klahadore,
these people are--

41
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,970
That can wait for now.

42
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,470
I can hear all about your reasons later.

43
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,120
Now leave, all of you!

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,520
Or do you have something to say?

45
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,360
Well, actually, we want a ship!

46
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,490
No!

47
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,120
Usopp-kun!

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Crap!

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,300
I've heard all about you.

50
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,980
You're well-known in the village.

51
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,160
Yeah?

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
I hear you've been
on many an adventure.

53
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,420
Quite impressive for
someone so young.

54
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,980
You can call me Captain Usopp, too!

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,120
Since you admire me so much!

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,660
Captain, huh?

57
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,800
I've heard all about
your father, as well.

58
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,090
What?!

59
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,570
Klahadore! Stop!

60
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,220
You're nothing but the
son of a filthy pirate!

61
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,740
Nothing you do will surprise me,

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,700
but I ask that you stay away
from the lady of this house!

63
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,530
F-Filthy?!

64
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,680
She and you are from
completely different worlds!

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,750
Is it money you're after?
How much do you want?

66
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,920
That's enough, Klahadore!
Apologize to Usopp-san!

67
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,420
Hey, now! Be careful, Kaya!

68
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,130
What reason is there to apologize
to this savage man, my lady?

69
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,220
I am merely stating the truth.

70
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,970
I feel for you.

71
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,740
You must truly hate your
great idiot of a father

72
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,620
for abandoning his family and village
because of his lust for treasure!

73
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,680
Klahadore!

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,940
Don't you dare insult
my father any more!

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,950
Usopp-san!

76
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,160
What are you getting
unnecessarily riled up for?

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,210
Why not simply tell another of
your special lies at a time like this?

78
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,560
About how your father is
really a traveling salesman,

79
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,550
or how you're not
really related by blood...

80
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,470
Shut up!

81
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,720
--Captain!
--Captain!

82
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,460
S-See! You immediately
resort to violence!

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,320
Like father, like son!

84
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,450
Shut up!

85
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,890
I'm proud that my father is a pirate!

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,390
I'm proud that he's a
brave warrior of the sea!

87
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,950
You're right, I am an exaggerator!

88
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,630
But I'll never lie about my pride
to be related by blood to a pirate!

89
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,380
I'm the son of a pirate!

90
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,680
Captain...

91
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,210
A pirate, a brave warrior of the sea?

92
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,310
That's quite a twisted
way of putting things...

93
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,360
But you're the undeniable
proof of his savage blood!

94
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,800
You run around spouting lies,

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
and act violent whenever you're angry!

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,070
And to top it off, you cozy
up to the lady of this house

97
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,530
so you can get her fortune!

98
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,130
What?! I only--!

99
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,710
The fact that your father is a pirate...

100
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,870
...is more than enough proof
that you'd hatch such a scheme!

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,630
Damn it, you still won't let up?!

102
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,090
Stop, Usopp-san!

103
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,490
Please, no more violence!

104
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,140
Klahadore isn't a bad person!

105
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,900
He's just...

106
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,720
He's just trying too hard
to do what's best for me!

107
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,910
Leave this place!

108
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,780
Never come near this mansion again!

109
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Yeah, I get it.

110
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,400
I don't need you to tell me!

111
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,490
I'll never come back here again!

112
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,850
Usopp-san...

113
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,260
You stupid butt-ler jerk!

114
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
Our captain's not that kind of guy!

115
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,900
Yeah! You stupid-head!

116
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,800
Stupid-head!

117
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,930
Stupid-head!

118
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,090
Why're you saying it, too?!

119
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,640
--What's your problem?!
--Hey, now! Stop!

120
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,040
--Let go! You stupid butler!
--What?!

121
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,320
Come fight me, if you can!

122
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,780
You will leave at once, too!

123
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,100
Your meal, my lady.

124
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,520
No thanks. I don't want it.

125
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,880
The cook would be sad
to hear you say that.

126
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,970
He works his hardest to come up
with meals that suit your needs.

127
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,950
Why did you talk like that?

128
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,050
I know I was wrong to talk with
Usopp-san without telling you.

129
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,630
But you didn't need to
kick him out like that.

130
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,880
May I sit?

131
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,220
Go ahead.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,170
It's been nearly three years...

133
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,770
...since the day I came to this mansion.

134
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,850
I'll never forget what
happened that day...

135
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,490
I was kicked off the ship I worked on

136
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,020
because of a blunder I made,

137
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,170
and with no work or money,

138
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,140
I was on the verge
of dying like a beggar.

139
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,090
Hey, you! Get out of here!

140
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,200
Get up! This is no place
for the likes of you!

141
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,080
Huh?! Sir?! But...

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,340
Understood! Take him
inside and tend to him!

143
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,870
In my eyes, I owe my life
to your late parents...

144
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,470
And to you, their daughter.

145
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:29,180
I realize that it isn't my place
to interfere with your friendships.

146
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,890
But that Usopp lad isn't exactly
known for his upstanding character!

147
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,810
If... if anything should happen to you,

148
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,620
I would never be able to ask for
forgiveness from your kind parents!

149
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,690
Do you think ill of me
for what I did earlier?

150
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,030
No, not at all!

151
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,630
I'm glad to have you, too, Klahadore!

152
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,480
But please don't misunderstand.

153
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,850
Usopp-san is a very nice person.

154
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,140
However, whether he's
nice or not is irrelevant!

155
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,480
Klahadore! Urgh! You blockhead!

156
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,310
Yes, "blockhead" will do just fine!

157
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,330
Hey, where'd Luffy go?

158
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,020
Who knows? Probably
ran after that "captain."

159
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,500
Our captain would be at his spot!

160
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,230
Yeah, the shore!

161
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,770
He always goes there
when something happens!

162
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,540
Wanna check it out?

163
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,110
Huh? Nah, that's okay.

164
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,370
But never mind that,
isn't one of you missing?

165
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,090
--Yeah, Onion!
--Yeah, Onion!

166
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,030
He always just ups and disappears!

167
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,520
Yeah! And then he
shows up all freaked out!

168
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,270
Bad news!

169
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,490
See?

170
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,570
A b-backwards guy!

171
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,970
A weird guy is
backwards-walking this way!

172
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,130
--Liar!
--Liar!

173
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,740
It's the truth!

174
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,190
Just look!

175
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,550
Hey! Who's calling me a weird guy?!

176
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,460
I am not weird!

177
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,620
Seem pretty weird to me.

178
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,010
Don't be stupid!

179
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,520
I'm just an ordinary,
passing-by hypnotist!

180
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,300
H-Hypnotist?! Awesome!

181
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,830
Show us something!

182
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,180
Yeah! Do something!

183
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,980
What?!

184
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,210
Don't be dumb!

185
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,410
Why should I have to
reveal my techniques

186
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,950
to a bunch of strangers?!

187
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,560
Alright. Watch this ring closely.

188
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,960
You're gonna do it?!

189
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,250
You'll feel sleepy at the
count of "one, two, Jango."

190
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,920
Alright, here we go!

191
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,170
One, two,

192
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,840
Jango!

193
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,850
Geez, what's with this guy?!

194
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,110
Yo!

195
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,310
Here you are!

196
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,160
Oh, it's just you!
At least say something, will ya?!

197
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,950
So, what, do you want something?!

198
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,010
Not really.

199
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
Oww...

200
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,600
That damn butler,

201
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,180
insulting my old man like that!

202
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,460
Yeah, I hate that guy too!

203
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,600
No matter what anyone says,
Yasopp was a great pirate!

204
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,140
Yeah, huh?!

205
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,220
In this day and age where
pirates are everywhere,

206
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,730
I'm proud of my old man for living
with his life on the line at sea!

207
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,560
Yet, that bastard
stomped all over my pride!

208
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,220
He'll pay for this!

209
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,570
But you're not gonna
go see the girl anymore?

210
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,470
Y-Yeah, I dunno...

211
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,450
If that butler comes and apologizes
to me, I might consider it.

212
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,370
That butler?

213
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,040
Yeah, that butler...

214
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,170
What's that butler doing out here?!

215
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,000
Oww! That hurts!

216
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,180
Hey, Jango.

217
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,680
I told you to avoid doing
anything to make you stand out.

218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,900
Yet you go and sleep in
the middle of the village...

219
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,450
Don't be stupid.

220
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,560
I don't stand out one bit.
I'm not weird, either.

221
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,660
There's someone else
with him. A weird guy...

222
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,320
Never seen him before. Who is he?

223
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,530
So, preparations for the
plan are ready, I hope?

224
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,200
Of course.

225
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,840
We can start anytime...

226
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,840
The Rich Girl Assassination Plan!

227
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,220
A-Assassination?!

228
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,140
Don't call it assassination, Jango.
That has a bad ring to it.

229
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,580
Oh, right. Accident. It's an accident.

230
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,380
Hey, what're those
guys talking about?

231
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,420
D-Don't look at me!
That's what I'd like to know!

232
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,090
We can't simply kill her.

233
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,260
Miss Kaya must perish
in an unfortunate accident.

234
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,890
Don't mess that up!

235
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,900
So basically, on your signal,

236
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,770
the men and I storm
the village and kill the girl.

237
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,540
And then you'll get her inheritance...

238
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,440
You fool! You don't
understand a thing!

239
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,030
How would I, an outsider,
inherit Kaya's estate?!

240
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,950
You'll work hard to?

241
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,580
Working hard won't amount to squat.

242
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,160
Listen, this is the
most important thing!

243
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,550
Before you kill her, you'll use
hypnosis to make Kaya write her will...

244
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,000
...to say, "I leave my entire
fortune to my butler, Klahadore!"

245
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,300
Only then will I inherit
her enormous fortune...

246
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,760
In a completely ordinary manner...

247
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,640
I've spent three long years gaining
the trust of everyone around me

248
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,690
so that it would be unsurprising for
her to leave her inheritance to me.

249
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,650
Three years as a butler for that, huh?

250
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,150
But you sure scared us back then...

251
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,360
Captain Kuro.

252
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,040
Three years ago, you suddenly said
you were giving up life as a pirate.

253
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,040
In no time flat, you set up
a subordinate to be your double,

254
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,650
then let the world see
Captain Kuro get executed.

255
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,180
So that was the very
beginning of this plan.

256
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,270
You truly are Kuro,
Man of a Thousand Plans.

257
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,400
Don't call me that.

258
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,730
I abandoned that
name three years ago.

259
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,480
I now want to obtain
great sums of money

260
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,280
without the government on my back.

261
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,760
In other words, I'm a pacifist.

262
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,530
Some pacifist you are,

263
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,040
killing off an entire rich family
for this "peace" of yours.

264
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,710
Hold on, now.
The father's death was real.

265
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,420
I hadn't planned on that.

266
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,990
Well, whatever. It doesn't matter.

267
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,680
Anyways, hurry and give the signal.

268
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,890
We've been sitting in the waters
near here for a whole week now.

269
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,530
The men are starting
to grow impatient.

270
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,240
This is bad!

271
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,850
We heard something really bad!

272
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,940
Hey, what's going on?
This sounds kind of bad.

273
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,680
Weren't you listening
this whole time?!

274
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,790
This is seriously bad!
They're the real deal!

275
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,250
Captain Kuro is said
to be the smartest

276
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,000
and most brutal pirate of all!

277
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,820
Word had it the navy caught and
executed him three years ago...

278
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,470
...but Captain Kuro is alive!

279
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,710
As Klahadore, the butler!

280
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:45,680
He's been after Kaya's fortune
for these past three years straight!

281
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,210
They're gonna attack the village!

282
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,110
Kaya's in danger, too!

283
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,150
Bad! This is seriously bad!

284
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,040
Hey! Don't stand up! They'll see you!

285
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,490
Hey, you guys! Don't attack that girl!

286
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,500
Who're you?!

287
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,370
You idiot! They spotted you!

288
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,470
Hurry and hide before they kill you!

289
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,850
Oh... If it isn't Usopp-kun.

290
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,810
They spotted me, too!

291
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,770
Did you... hear anything?

292
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,530
N-No! Whatever do you mean?!

293
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,240
We just got here now, so of
course we didn't hear anything!

294
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,440
We heard everything!

295
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,400
Hey, you!

296
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,330
Oh, all right.

297
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,010
Hey, you guys!

298
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,540
Watch this ring closely!

299
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,450
What?

300
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,560
T-This is bad!
It's a throwing weapon! Dodge it!

301
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,850
At the count of "one, two,
Jango" you will get sleepy.

302
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,820
Ready?

303
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,220
--One, two...
--Hide! He's gonna kill us!

304
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
...Jango!

305
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,060
Hey! Wake up, Jango!

306
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,160
Have you still not
fixed that habit yet?!

307
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,810
H-Hey! What're you doing?!
You're gonna fall!

308
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,870
Head-first...

309
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,560
I didn't mean to kill him,

310
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,260
but he couldn't have
survived from that height...

311
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
Damn it!

312
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,180
He killed him!

313
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,590
That bastard! Damn it!

314
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,080
What about the other one?
Shall I take care of him?

315
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,560
No need.

316
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,760
No matter what he does,
it won't matter.

317
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,860
Tomorrow morning, Jango.
Attack the village at daybreak.

318
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,060
Tear up the villagers'
homes a good amount,

319
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,360
and make certain Miss Kaya's
murder looks like an accident!

320
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,820
Tomorrow!

321
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,340
You heard me, Usopp-kun.

322
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,290
There's nothing you
can do to stop my plan.

323
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,560
Damn it!

324
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,190
You sure about him?

325
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,190
Of course. My plans are flawless.

326
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,260
This is bad, this is bad, this is bad!

327
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,610
Everyone in this village I grew
up in is going to be killed!

328
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,640
Kaya's going to be killed!

329
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,140
Even though I love them all!

330
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,790
Who are you?!

331
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,370
I'm Usopp!
A brave warrior of the sea!

332
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,540
I hear you've been unhappy lately!

333
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
I'll cheer you up with a story!

334
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,020
Mind your own business!

335
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,610
Please leave! I'll call for someone!

336
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,640
And then? What happened after that?!

337
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,560
I fought, of course! Bravely, at that!

338
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,020
First, for the giant cat,
I used a cattail plant...

339
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,900
Damn it!

340
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

341
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

342
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,970
before someone else could
beat me to it

343
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:52,570
If the world is going to change

344
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:59,570
before I can even attain my dream

345
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,650
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

346
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:19,550
so that my memories won't fade

347
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,950
Usopp ran by with a really
intense look. Did something happen?

348
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,650
That butler is a pirate!
He told his crew to attack the village!

349
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,530
Now they'll know, and can run
away beforehand! That's a relief!

350
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,740
--Oh, no!
--What is it?!

351
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,580
We need to stock up on food
before the meat shop guy runs away!

352
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,470
That's not the issue at hand here!

353
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

354
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,340
"Expose the Plot!
Pirate Butler Captain Kuro"

355
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,540
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
