2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,960
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,720
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,250
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,390
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,380
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,770
Negative Hollow!

48
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,120
What?!

49
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,080
My name is Captain Usopp.

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,380
Why?! Why aren't you falling to your knees?!

51
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,840
My ghost clearly hit you!

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,590
How did you counter it?

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,340
I didn't do anything to counter it.

54
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,850
I've always been negative!

55
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,810
What?!

56
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,940
"The General Zombies Are Down in a Flash!!
Oars Feels Like an Adventure!!"

57
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,130
The ghosts' negative powers
don't work on him!

58
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,780
What a formidable human!

59
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,490
My Negative Hollow is ineffective?
But that's impossible!

60
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,160
There is no such thing as a
human immune to that move!

61
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:22,360
D-Damn it...! I told them that
I couldn't defeat the zombies.

62
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,550
Why didn't they take out a single one?

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,020
Even if I defeat that woman,
it's obvious that they'll take me out!

64
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,390
Shoot! I'm gonna die like this.

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,690
It's hopeless! No matter
how I look at it, I'm doomed!

66
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,920
I must have made some sort
of mistake a second ago.

67
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,790
You're going to lose all will to
live when they strike at once.

68
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,000
Four times the negativity! Negative Hollows!

69
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,360
They got him!

70
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,260
All of them landed direct hits!

71
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,830
Sweet!

72
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,140
Ever since Thriller Bark got up and running,

73
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,970
no one has been able to
stand up to those ghosts!

74
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,830
He out-negatived the Negative Ghosts!

75
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,930
Kumacy, sorry I'm always so mean to you.

76
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,210
The effect has spread back to Perona-sama!

77
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,760
Is that man a sage or a saint?!

78
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,310
Listen... When it comes to thinking negatively...

79
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,560
...I'll have you know I'm unbeatable!

80
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,860
Wow! He's super confident in a bad way!

81
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,320
But why is it? For someone bursting
with confidence, he looks mighty small.

82
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,750
Isn't he trying to escape?

83
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,790
--Busted!
--Wait!

84
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,450
Crud! They saw through my plan.

85
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,840
Wild Shot: Salt Star!

86
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,310
Curse you! You've started to purify
my darling Wild Zombies yet again!

87
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,230
Stay away from me! Salt Star!

88
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,150
He's got salt! Be careful!

89
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,540
Covering your mouths is against the rules!

90
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,040
I wish I had kept that "Salt Star" part to myself!

91
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,010
I can't believe Usopp's
negative outlook came in handy!

92
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,590
If it weren't for him,
she could have wiped us out!

93
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,260
She's got one terrifying ability...

94
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,180
--Hey...
--Huh?

95
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,770
This is where our paths diverge.
I'm gonna head over to Nami-san!

96
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,270
Got it! Be sure to save her!

97
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,110
You bet! I'm the Will-o-the-wisp of Love!

98
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,360
Nami-san!

99
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,370
I won't let you get married!

100
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,700
He jumped...

101
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,960
Wasn't this pretty high up?

102
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,460
Well, supposedly an adrenaline rush
can dull a person's sense of pain.

103
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,180
Anyway, we need to reach
that mansion's top floor!

104
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,840
--Yeah!
--That's where we'll find the skeleton!

105
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,820
Are you quite finished yet?

106
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,090
Why don't you be a man and admit defeat?

107
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,340
You are like a phoenix... Or perhaps a zombie!

108
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,730
You shouldn't have the strength left to stand.

109
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,520
I am just about ready to fully immobilize you

110
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,290
so that you will never come
after your shadow again.

111
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,830
What shall I sever with my
special move, the Notch Slash?

112
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,940
You don't...

113
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,400
You don't know a darn thing...

114
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,250
Don't use that name!

115
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,530
I came from a certain kingdom's assault convoy.

116
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:08,270
The quick slash that I specialized in
was called "Requiem La Banderole."

117
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:14,380
The nickname my crewmates gave
that technique out of admiration was...

118
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,070
...Three-Pace Hum: Notch Slash!

119
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,320
You may share my personality and abilities,

120
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,200
but I don't want you to use that
name if you cannot remember

121
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,990
my past and the feelings I harbor!

122
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,760
If you feel that you are
the true master of this style,

123
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,920
prove as much by defeating my "fake" style.

124
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,800
This is your last chance.

125
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,280
Three-Pace Hum...

126
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,870
...Notch Slash!

127
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,190
Seeing them like this, they look just alike!

128
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,490
Brook's hair really resembles Laboon!

129
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,020
Hey, Brother!

130
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,690
Laboon!

131
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,280
More than anything,
I want to apologize to you...

132
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,620
I want to apologize for my endless bad luck...

133
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:47,800
Fifty years on the dark sea...
Time has passed so slowly...

134
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,930
I can't believe my life was in vain!

135
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,570
What a lonesome... life it's been!

136
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,040
I've been so lonely...

137
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,980
Now then, where should I begin cutting?

138
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,050
For starters, this afro must go.

139
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,160
For starters, this afro must go.

140
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,520
What?! The mansion is shaking!

141
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,860
Hey, why is the mansion shaking?

142
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,280
Like I'd know! Maybe there's an earthquake.

143
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,160
Is that the lab?

144
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,000
There he is! Hey, Skeleton!

145
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,920
Dude! You took a royal beating,
but you're still with us, aren't you?

146
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,930
You're still alive, right?!

147
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,890
Wh-What are you doing here...?

148
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,770
I can't allow this! You should
not touch the loser in a duel!

149
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,530
Whoa, there!

150
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,400
Is it you?

151
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,820
Are you the legendary samurai who
supposedly killed a dragon a long time ago?

152
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,460
I've been wanting to see you!

153
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,130
What's going on up there?
The whole place is shaking!

154
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,060
The ship has probably gotten
caught in a weird current.

155
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,140
I think it's probably your fault, too!

156
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,070
So, what do you want? What brought you here?

157
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:57,070
Right. You had some nerve,
tearing off my shadow earlier.

158
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,380
I'll be taking my shadow back.

159
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,830
Right along with Zoro's, Sanji's, Brook's,
the grandpa zombie's, and everyone's!

160
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,550
You're one greedy bastard!
How are you going to get them back?

161
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,510
I'm gonna kick your butt!

162
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,070
Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch!

163
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,160
Smooch! Smooch!
Smooch! Smooch! Smooch!

164
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:55,420
Smooch! Smooch! Smooch!
Smooch! Smooch! Smooch!...

165
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,900
Just a second! Why is the ship shaking?!

166
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,830
I can't kiss my bride!

167
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,100
Absalom-sama!

168
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,560
What is it? Do you know what the deal is?

169
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,980
Our giant ship, Thriller Bark,
is caught in a strange current!

170
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,270
It's changing our course!

171
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,920
The entire island is shaking!

172
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,880
How did that happen?!

173
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,600
Well, it looks like that Special Zombie
is messing with the rudder.

174
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,910
What?!

175
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,500
It's moving! It's moving!

176
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,630
Take that!

177
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,540
Move!

178
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,010
Move! Move! Move! Move!

179
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,700
General Zombies, all of you are
to set out at once! Stop Oars!

180
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,390
Sir!

181
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,200
Move! Move! Move!

182
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,990
Oars!

183
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,000
Playtime is over, Special Zombie Oars.

184
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,930
Chop him down from the legs!

185
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,130
Where's Oars?

186
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,510
He vanished! Oars vanished!

187
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,470
But he's so big...

188
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,750
How could he be so quick?!

189
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,770
There he is! Look up!

190
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,610
Gum-Gum...

191
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,030
Actually, I'm not made of rubber.

192
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,740
Gatling!

193
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,880
Don't get in the way of my adventure!

194
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,390
Annihilated?! But they just left...

195
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,820
Uh, right. They're as flat as pancakes.

196
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,590
They composed the strongest
zombie army on the island!

197
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,240
They were General Zombies!

198
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,060
Right. They were out in a flash.

199
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,270
Absurd... Wasn't Oars on our side...?

200
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,280
Why is he going on a rampage?

201
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,730
Zombies have no choice but to obey our orders!

202
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:14,620
What will happen to Thriller Bark
if we let him run loose...?

203
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,460
Nami-san!

204
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,970
I came for you!

205
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,640
There she is!

206
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,240
He's part of the Straw Hat Crew!

207
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,620
Amazing...! He pushed Ryuma back.

208
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,050
Who is he?

209
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,470
He's a stinkin' aggressive pirate swordsman
who practices the Three-Sword Style.

210
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,020
He's damn strong!

211
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,450
If your pride will stand for it,
I bet he'd recover your shadow for you.

212
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,750
What do you say?

213
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,990
My shadow? Really? Oh, please do!

214
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,740
I'm begging you!
Please recover my shadow for--

215
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,490
Shut up! Keep quiet!

216
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,160
--Ploink!
--Hey! Skeleton!

217
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,710
You know, that looks like a good sword.

218
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,550
You have a good eye! This is in fact
one of the 21 O-Wazamono swords.

219
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,070
It has a black blade with a reversed saw.

220
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,890
This famous sword is called Shusui.

221
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,520
It's not the sort of thing you see every day.

222
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,580
So it's a sweet sword? Looks like
I've come across a nice find!

223
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,530
Of course, I figured you'd have something
halfway decent since you're a samurai...

224
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,670
All right! I'll be using that sword from now on.

225
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,470
You're too cool!

226
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,240
Ploink!

227
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,490
Nami-san! I will never
leave your side ever again!

228
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,260
--Right! I will always be with you!
--Bastard! We were in the middle

229
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,010
--No, for all eternity!
--of an important ceremony!

230
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,350
Listen to me!

231
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,270
Why do I have to listen to you?

232
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,770
Mincemeat is too good for the likes of you!

233
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,900
On the next episode of One Piece!

234
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,350
"Blazing Knight Sanji!!
Kick Down the Fake Wedding!"

235
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,210
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
