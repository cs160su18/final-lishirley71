2
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,710
"Farewell, Navy Fortress!
The Last Battle for Escape"

18
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,770
Not good! Not good!
Not good! Not good! Not good!

19
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,520
My subjugation squad!

20
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,950
They got you good, Inspector Shepherd.

21
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,420
I-I've driven them this far!
I leave the rest to you!

22
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,500
If they escape now, it will be
entirely your responsibility!

23
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,630
Entirely mine? Very well.

24
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,970
But you'd best report to headquarters

25
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,630
about a certain someone else
who kept getting in the way.

26
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,920
The Straw Hat pirates...

27
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,290
They're exactly as
Admiral Akainu described them.

28
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,340
As strange as it sounds, it's thanks
to them that we can now prove

29
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,940
the importance of Navarone Fortress
to the faultfinders at HQ.

30
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,980
They entered our impregnable fortress,

31
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,040
broke through many traps and pursuits,

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,170
and are now attempting to escape again.

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,700
But, however great they may be as pirates...

34
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,240
General? Oh, good.
Stand by until I give orders.

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,410
Yes, sir! Remain on standby!

36
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,510
Yes, sir!

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,450
Commander! Are you just going
to sit there idly and watch?!

38
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,480
Now, now. Just watch patiently.
The time for checkmate is nearing.

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,400
But...!

40
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,690
As I said, they're as good as captured.

41
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,890
The 9:00 pm net has
already sprung into action.

42
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,770
What do you mean? What is this
"9:00 pm" stuff you keep mentioning?

43
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,540
You'll just have to wait and see!

44
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,240
All right! Full speed ahead!

45
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,700
Our navigator doesn't seem
interested in going forward, though.

46
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,710
Nami-san! What's wrong?

47
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,800
Is there something behind us?!

48
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,180
Look! Navarone warships!

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,440
Whew! They don't seem to be chasing us!

50
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,190
They dropped their anchors?!

51
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,700
They must've given up.

52
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,410
I wonder.

53
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,250
They gave in to our brilliant skills!

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,170
Even when they could at least fire at us?

55
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't tell me there's some other reason?!

56
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,310
That's what's bugging me-- I don't know!

57
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,300
Bugged Nami-san is lovely, too!

58
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,020
Commander! It's finally begun!

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,830
Good. Do as I instructed.

60
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,360
Was that Drake?! Then order him
to pursue them this instant!

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,320
Why are they lowering their
anchors and sitting there?!

62
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,210
The reason they've dropped their
anchors... is because it's 9:00 pm.

63
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,790
"9:00 pm" again?!

64
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,830
If they don't drop their anchors,

65
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,490
the fangs of Navarone's
waters will eat them up.

66
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,080
The fangs of Navarone's waters?

67
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,690
What's that sound?!

68
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,920
It sounds like a flowing river!

69
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,300
There's a river on this island?

70
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,390
I must not have noticed it this afternoon.

71
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,330
Can you see now?

72
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,440
Nami-san! What's happening?!

73
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,110
T-The rudder isn't working!

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,700
The tide! A huge outward tide
happens at this time at this fortress!

75
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,890
No!

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,750
Eaten by the waters' fangs?

77
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,680
However skilled a navigator
those Straw Hats may have,

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,150
the fact that they're on a ship
means they can't escape from this net.

79
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,260
No one escapes from my clutches.

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,880
So that's what the deal was...

81
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,300
What are you acting satisfied for?!

82
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,560
When we first tried to escape,

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,900
I was puzzled as to why they'd use
a bay so full of shore reefs as a port.

84
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,870
So?

85
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
It was the other way around.

86
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,130
Shallows are bad for ports,
so they normally use the Sea Gate

87
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,630
to regulate the water level inside.

88
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,530
But they can use the low tide in an emergency

89
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,910
to make this great fortress
of Mother Nature inescapable!

90
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,630
So that's why ships could only
come and go at specific times.

91
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,830
You're so smart, Nami-san!
Your logic is spot-on!

92
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,050
So, what do we do?

93
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,770
All right! Let's head for the Sea Gate!

94
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,140
We can't!

95
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,480
Full speed ahead!

96
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,570
Pay attention!

97
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,440
Luffy!

98
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,020
W-What the--?!

99
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,820
We've run onto a reef!

100
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,710
The hull!

101
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,800
It's been ripped open!

102
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,860
Someone come help!

103
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,160
O-Oh, no!

104
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,890
It's damn huge!

105
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,130
Can't we plug it up?!

106
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,500
A plug! Something to plug it up! A plug!

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,410
Huh?

108
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,010
The water stopped...

109
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,650
I'm drowning! I'm drowning!

110
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,880
The ship's completely run aground!

111
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,910
Does that mean--?

112
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,680
We can't move forward or escape.

113
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,980
Looks like the enemy was counting on this.

114
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,630
I'm drowning! I'm drowning! I'm gonna drown!

115
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,750
It's one thing after the
other with these guys!

116
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,450
What now? Ditch the ship again and run?

117
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,990
And go through the same stuff again?!

118
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,560
It's not the same! The ship's gonna
sink when the tide comes back!

119
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,650
The gold, too?!

120
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,750
I refuse to let that happen!

121
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,520
Save me! I'm hungry!

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,060
This is the Impact Dial!

123
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,720
Can we use this?!

124
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,770
Given how much the tide has
gone out, we won't have to worry

125
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,290
about the ship sinking
until the next high tide.

126
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,400
But we can't move, either.

127
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,990
Okay! Let's have some food!

128
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,260
How can you be so carefree?! Look at that!

129
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,050
Attention, Straw Hat Luffy and his crewmates!

130
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,250
"Full of Power!"
"Carbohydrates!"
"Navy Dining Hall"

131
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,220
Seems the Straw Hat pirates
got caught in the 9:00 pm net!

132
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,300
Not even they can escape from
the fangs of Navarone's waters!

133
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,690
What's gonna happen to him?!

134
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:21,290
Well... Pirates have always been
subjected to capital punishment...

135
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,980
You can't, not in your
condition! You're sick, Dad!

136
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,590
Quiet! That stupid sickness is long gone!

137
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,910
He better not have ruined
that wonderful ship!

138
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,490
If he has, I'll kick his ass!

139
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,350
Mr. Raccoon Dog...

140
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:53,670
You've fought most valiantly
against the Navy's great G8 Fortress!

141
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm impressed, enemy as you are.

142
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,070
You've done admirably, but this
is checkmate, Straw Hat Pirates!

143
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,820
Listen! Don't you even dare
think about trying to escape!

144
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,040
I can anticipate everything
you might think up!

145
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,360
Yes! Atta boy!

146
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,970
As commander of Navarone Fortress,

147
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,260
I will greet the Straw Hat
Pirates with utmost respect!

148
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,900
Give yourselves up quietly!

149
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,010
Luffy!

150
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,970
Straw Hat!

151
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,010
You and Roronoa Zoro both
have bounties on your heads,

152
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,320
so I will have to hand
you over to headquarters.

153
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,510
But I will guarantee the safety
of the rest of your crew.

154
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,870
But if you even think of
escaping... I'll get mad!

155
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
Too lenient!

156
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,910
I'm the commander here. You're the
inspector. Be quiet and inspect.

157
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,170
A-At this rate, I'll wind up having done
nothing but get in the way of a badger!

158
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,920
I came to crush this fortress, but now
my own relevance is in question!

159
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,200
If you'll excuse me, please!

160
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,940
We still have a chance!

161
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,560
An Impact Dial!

162
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,290
When we escaped from the fortress,
I gathered a ton of impacts!

163
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,730
We might be able to make the
ship float in the air using this!

164
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,700
Oh!

165
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,560
Ah!

166
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,350
We just need to use it to go
somewhere where there's ocean!

167
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,380
But one shot won't be enough.

168
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,940
With that huge hole,
the ship'll sink right away!

169
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,580
If we could just make the
octopus balloon fly again...

170
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,920
Yeah, good thinking!

171
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,450
Couldn't we re-inflate it
with Flame and Breath Dials?

172
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,490
Yes! Yes, that's great!

173
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,100
The octopus isn't here...

174
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,790
The octopus...

175
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,430
The octopus.

176
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,240
Damn octopus...

177
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,790
The octopus...

178
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,300
The octopus?!

179
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,940
I have it.

180
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,830
He says he has it.

181
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,830
He has it?

182
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,770
He has it.

183
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,630
He damn has it.

184
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,670
So he has it.

185
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,090
He has it?

186
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,620
Yep. I have it.

187
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,970
Eh?!

188
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,870
See?

189
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,950
What do you have that thing for?!

190
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,620
It saved our lives on
our way back from the sky.

191
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,980
Maybe so, but didn't it feel gross?!

192
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,470
Gross how?

193
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,150
Let's have the octopus work
for us again. Okay, Long-nose?

194
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,510
Y-Yeah.

195
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,650
But hold on. I can't find my Flame Dial--

196
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,430
It was neat, so I was playing
with it in the kitchen!

197
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,760
Oww! You moron!

198
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,830
Now, then! That just leaves us
with who'll fire this Impact Dial...

199
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,180
What's with those looks?!

200
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,750
Whose Impact Dial is that?

201
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,840
Usopp's.

202
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,090
Right, Long-nose?

203
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,520
It's only natural that the suggester does it.

204
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,130
You're so wonderful, Usopp!

205
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,420
I really respect you!

206
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,580
Oh, come on. We'll help you out.

207
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,480
Y-You can't be serious...

208
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,850
Then it's decided!

209
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,820
No!

210
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,590
General! Prepare to open fire!

211
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,130
Yes, sir!

212
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,440
Prepare to fire!

213
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,510
Preparations complete!

214
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,210
Good work, dear.

215
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,420
Work is important, but you need
to eat at the proper times, too!

216
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,290
But broccoli and carrots
and green peppers aren't--

217
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,880
No, I haven't finished work yet!

218
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,060
The Straw Hats are sealed off so completely--

219
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,710
surely they can't do anything now.

220
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,520
Now you just need to capture them alive.

221
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,890
Yes... But they could still
defy all our expectations.

222
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,280
How can they possibly escape,
trapped between land and sea?!

223
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,270
Where did they appear from?

224
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,080
Eh?!

225
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,200
They still have the sky.

226
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,250
All set here!

227
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,370
Roger that!

228
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,890
Things are ready up here!
Take care of things down there!

229
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,570
No! I don't wanna!
This's gonna hurt like crazy!

230
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,080
Three!

231
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
Two!

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,040
One!

233
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,270
Damn you, Straw Hats!
You've embarrassed me to no end!

234
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,730
I will crush you all myself!

235
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,690
Impact!

236
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,200
They are flying!

237
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,380
Those guys...

238
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,840
What?!

239
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,520
How do I put this...?

240
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,930
We're falling! We're falling! We're falling!

241
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,700
Robin! You're up!

242
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,470
Cien Fleurs!

243
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,400
We're still falling!

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,770
Luffy! The Flame Dial!

245
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,750
All right!

246
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,800
Inflate, you!

247
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,040
Usopp-sama! You got another order up!

248
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,800
D-Don't be stupid! I'm not a tofu seller!

249
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,680
I'll make you some damn
tres bien tofu sometime! Okay?!

250
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,470
You can't be serious!

251
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,260
Fly!

252
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,180
Please, please, please fly!

253
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,730
I said fly, so fly!

254
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,530
You can do it, Mr. Octopus!

255
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,720
Whoa! What now?!

256
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,130
Water's getting in!

257
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,060
Urgh! All right! Usopp-sama's
going for another one!

258
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,570
Support my shoulders and arms again...

259
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,430
Well said!

260
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,460
That's how you do it!

261
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,360
This pain is the Going Merry's pain!

262
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,030
Three!

263
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,760
Two!

264
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,690
One!

265
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,290
Fly!

266
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,880
Fly!

267
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,370
Fly!

268
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,290
Fly!!

269
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,550
Impact!

270
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,060
A giant octopus?!

271
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,970
You gotta be kidding me!

272
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,090
It worked!

273
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,730
A hot-air balloon, huh?
Hmph, so you refuse to listen to me?

274
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,640
Shoot it down when it's within firing range!

275
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,740
But do not shoot the ship itself!
They must be caught alive!

276
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,320
Those are some tall orders...

277
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,470
Fire a warning shot!

278
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,630
If they don't stop, aim the
second shot for the balloon!

279
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,890
Understood!

280
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,350
I refuse to let you escape, Straw Hat!

281
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,300
Not yet... The first one's
just a warning shot!

282
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,200
It's all over!

283
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,720
You've done it again, Major Shepherd...

284
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,900
He's gone...

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,630
Mr. Raccoon Dog and the others are flying!

286
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,940
Just like I told ya! They fell from the sky!

287
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,920
Awesome! It really is a hedgehog!

288
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,960
What an impressive-looking fortress!

289
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,660
This is goodbye, old man!

290
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,790
Adieu, Jessica-san!

291
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,850
Are we gonna be okay?!
Won't we get shot down at this speed?!

292
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,550
This fortress is for
protecting the peace at sea.

293
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,940
They don't have cannons
that aim into the sky.

294
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Dear...

295
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
They finally got away.

296
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,030
Oh, General! Are you all right?

297
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,190
Yes, Commander! The battery has
been ruined, but no one is injured!

298
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,780
Glad to hear it! Good work!

299
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,090
Commander! Let's go after them!
Order a search-and-destroy!

300
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,810
They escaped into the sky. Give it up.

301
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,620
But--!

302
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,420
Lt. Commander Drake. You did well!
Thank you for your hard work!

303
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,780
Commander...

304
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,670
Oh! Major Shepherd!

305
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,300
Commander!

306
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,410
Are you going to blame this on me?!
This was all your fault!

307
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,630
I'm going to contact headquarters

308
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:33,970
and make sure your heads
roll and roll and roll and roll!

309
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,380
Even if you are Admiral Akainu's lapdogs,

310
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,750
my report will bring this
outdated hedgehog down!

311
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,460
I'm going to make it so none
of your men remain in the navy!

312
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,700
I don't kiss!

313
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,700
You dumbass!

314
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,930
"Justice"

315
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,970
Are you sure about this?
You let the Straw Hats escape...

316
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:07,600
Yes. I didn't invite them here,
plus we achieved our primary goal.

317
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,930
Eh?

318
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,560
Don't you get the feeling that
everyone here has started to unify?

319
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,690
I have noticed it, actually.

320
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,040
That's good enough. They gave
a good jolt to this fortress.

321
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,070
I'm aware that headquarters
thinks we're unnecessary.

322
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,370
That we're "too big,"
that we're "peace addicts"...

323
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,620
But that's fine with me!

324
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,960
What's most important is that
we soldiers and you support staff

325
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,590
work hard to protect
the peace, don't you think?

326
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,270
There are still pirates out
there like the Straw Hats.

327
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,670
Headquarters will probably be
reminded of the need for this fortress.

328
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,340
I won't let you all get
thrown out into the street.

329
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,070
Have you fallen for me again?

330
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,620
You dummy...

331
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,290
But do you think he'll give a
good report to headquarters?

332
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,870
I got carried away and slugged him...

333
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,320
It doesn't matter! Besides,
I was going to hit him, too!

334
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,670
Well, then, Straw Hat. How far will you go?

335
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,550
There are people at headquarters
who express interest in you.

336
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,170
Your road ahead won't be an easy one.

337
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,600
Flying feels so nice!

338
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,990
How far are we gonna fly?

339
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,990
How should I know? Ask the octopus.

340
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,770
It's nice to enjoy a leisurely trip
through the sky sometimes.

341
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,860
But no more navy bases!

342
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,780
As long as I'm with Nami-san and Robin-chan,

343
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,320
everywhere is heaven!

344
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,210
Moron.

345
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,690
Huh?!

346
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,790
I said, "Moron."

347
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,480
Huh?!

348
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,990
Well, then! Guess I'll
get to fixing the hull!

349
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,580
But I sure am hungry!

350
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,020
Sanji! Food!

351
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm hungry!

352
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

353
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

354
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

355
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,
on the road opened before us

356
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

357
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give in,
even if the obstacle is big

358
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared of,
we can overcome it

359
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,390
That fortress was so fun!

360
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,550
But where are we gonna land
this time? I feel so uneasy...

361
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,130
An island's been visible for a while.

362
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,710
Why couldn't you say so sooner?!

363
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,200
Man, how dull!

364
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,350
Are you referring to me?

365
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,390
No, I'm sorry.

366
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,440
It's the island that's dull.

367
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,860
What's with this island? What is this?!

368
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,250
On the next episode of One Piece!

369
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,470
"Great Adventure at Long Ring Long Land!"

370
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,570
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
