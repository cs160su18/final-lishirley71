2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,200
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,360
The feelings of those who are in anguish

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,610
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

22
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,910
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,440
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

24
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,550
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,430
Vivi and her friends continue to fight in
order to save Alabasta from its crisis...

26
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,920
In addition to Usopp and Chopper's victory...

27
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,300
...Sanji crushed Mr. 2 Bon Clay.

28
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,360
Meanwhile, Nami was engaged in
mortal combat with Miss Doublefinger,

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,090
who has Spike Spike Fruit powers.

30
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,400
Take this!

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Tornado Tempo!

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,180
--What?
--The doves tangled up on me...!

33
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,820
As a result, Usopp's invention,
the Clima Takt, led Nami to win the battle.

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,160
The only battle left was the one
between Mr. 1 and Zoro.

35
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,680
So basically, your body is hard as steel.

36
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,840
Unless I'm capable of cutting
even steel, I can't cut you down, huh?

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,180
That would be correct.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,430
Smashing and cutting
attacks don't work on me.

39
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,310
I see. This bites.

40
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,770
Since I'm not yet capable of
cutting steel, I can't defeat you now.

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Humph... Then what're you going to do?

42
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,230
Well, I'll sympathize with you.

43
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,240
What?

44
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,660
I've been waiting for a
difficult situation like this.

45
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,300
I've been thinking that it's about
time for me to go to the next level.

46
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,420
When I defeat you,

47
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,550
I'll be a man who can even cut steel.

48
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,260
"Secret of Powerful Swordplay! Ability to
Cut Steel and the Rhythm Things Have"

49
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,950
Humph... When you defeat me... huh?

50
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,870
This might throw cold water
on that enthusiasm of yours,

51
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,450
but ever since I gained Dice Dice powers,

52
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,980
I've never been given even a scratch by
those who call themselves swordsmen.

53
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,660
No swordsman can defeat me.

54
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,480
Ahh... I get the picture...

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,900
...but you can store all those
old tales away in an album.

56
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,910
I don't know how many swordsmen
you've fought in the past,

57
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,130
but we've never met before, so...

58
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,800
It seems that at least your tongue is sharp.

59
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,180
Thanks, baldy.

60
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,900
We'll see how long you'll last.

61
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,400
No, how long you'll last.

62
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,360
Oni...

63
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,620
...Giri!

64
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,040
Tiger... Trap!

65
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,460
I told you, didn't I...?

66
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,830
It's a little shocking that you
didn't even get a single bruise...

67
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,640
This is also the first time
my opponent is still standing

68
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,440
when I thought my attacks were solid.

69
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Of course...

70
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,010
...since we've never met before...

71
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,670
That's right!

72
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,400
This guy's entire body is a blade.

73
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,360
So his blades don't have a front or back!

74
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,580
Sparkling Daisy!

75
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,120
Th-This is...

76
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
I'll blow you away.

77
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,450
When it comes to training,
I've done it more than anyone else.

78
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,370
I've also been in many difficult
situations that had me on the brink.

79
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,810
When I defeat you, I'll be a
man who can even cut steel.

80
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,080
I've never been given
even a scratch by anyone.

81
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,130
What is it that I lack...?!

82
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,540
Teacher...! Teacher!

83
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,430
Hm?

84
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,420
Is it true that there're men in this world
who can cut anything, even steel?

85
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,340
Yes, it's true.

86
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,470
Now, watch this paper carefully, Zoro.

87
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,350
Teacher, you didn't cut it.

88
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,200
Listen, Zoro.

89
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,740
There're swordsmen out there
who are capable of cutting nothing.

90
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,870
But they can also cut anything,
even steel... using the same sword...

91
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,440
The strongest swordsmen are able to
protect that which they want to protect

92
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,710
and cut that which they want to cut.

93
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,960
Swordplay that harms whatever it touches...

94
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,050
I don't consider it real swordsmanship.

95
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,880
Do you understand?

96
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,230
Teacher, I'll be a swordsman
who can cut anything!

97
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,400
Zoro, were you listening
to what I was saying?

98
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,410
Humph... Hurry up and try cutting me.

99
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,600
You can't cut my body down
if you just defend.

100
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,900
Unfortunately, I don't think I can show
you my valiant figure cutting steel...

101
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,620
...because when I cut steel,
that's when you die.

102
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,580
Makes sense...

103
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,180
I'll cut... everything up into pieces!

104
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,830
"Swordplay that cuts nothing"... huh?

105
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,660
How pointless...

106
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,040
I'll cut everything up into pieces!

107
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,800
Swordplay that cuts nothing...

108
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,360
Cut nothing... but cut steel... I don't
understand what it means at all!

109
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,320
Thrust and Thrust... This is the
secret of powerful swordplay!

110
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,260
Atomic Spar!

111
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,410
I'll just cut you up!

112
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,370
Crab... Grab!

113
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,410
What an odious bastard...

114
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,370
The feeling is mutual.

115
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,300
Let me tell you one thing.
Don't consider me a swordsman.

116
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,120
I have many weapons
that can tear your body up.

117
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,560
Spiral Hollow!

118
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,480
If you're not a swordsman...
then an excavator?!

119
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm an assassin!

120
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,450
Sparks?! Just how fast is it spinning?!

121
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,040
They'll be repelled!

122
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,840
I can't do excavation... because
I'll drill and cut everything up.

123
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,050
Crap!

124
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,280
What a momentary misjudgment invites is...

125
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,790
...death!

126
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,630
You're still breathing...

127
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,140
I won't show my back to him...

128
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,820
How're you gonna struggle
with your bare hands?

129
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,170
You're not even a swordsman.
You won't understand even if I explain.

130
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,920
Humph... I'm not even interested.

131
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,510
Spar... Break!

132
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,000
Die in peace...

133
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,730
I have... bad luck with stones today...

134
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,600
You guys! Make sure you
deliver Vivi back to her home!

135
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,260
See you at the Alubarna Palace!

136
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,420
Are they... all okay...?

137
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,220
Why is he standing...?
After being cut so many times...

138
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,690
Did he dodge all those falling stones?

139
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,370
I dodged... these stones?

140
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,890
No...

141
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,360
I could tell... the place where
no stones would be falling...

142
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,380
Swords...

143
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,160
There's one underneath
that stone... I can tell...

144
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,180
What's he doing...?

145
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,800
I've experienced this feeling before...

146
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,010
It's awfully quiet around me...

147
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,160
I can hear my heartbeat very clearly...

148
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,400
Is this... precisely what it feels
like when close to death...?

149
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,430
I sensed a hint from the falling
stones as if they're living things...

150
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,430
No, it wasn't a hint...
It was clearer than that...

151
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,540
Rhythm...

152
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,690
Stones'... rhythm...

153
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,310
Trees have their own rhythm...

154
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,740
Soil has its own... Is that what it is...?

155
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,660
Listen. There're swordsmen out there
who are capable of cutting nothing.

156
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,190
Does "cutting nothing" mean...
know the rhythm...?

157
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,060
That's... the ability to cut even steel...

158
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,890
You... what the hell did you do?

159
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,680
After receiving such an enormous attack...

160
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,930
When you're bleeding that much...

161
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,100
There's no way you can be still alive...!

162
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,780
I can hear... the rhythm of his steel...

163
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,450
My will is flowing into the sword...

164
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,020
Fine... I'll completely finish
him off with the next attack.

165
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,350
The only question left is...

166
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,260
...whether or not I really
have the ability to cut steel...

167
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,770
It's hard to think that you can defend
my attack using only one sword...

168
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,740
That's all right. I won't defend any more.

169
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,540
So you're now prepared. Fine by me!

170
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,940
One-Sword Style... Lion Strike!

171
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,260
Atomic Spurt!

172
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,370
I give you my thanks...

173
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,880
I can become stronger still!

174
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,940
He's indeed... become stronger...
during this fight...

175
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,020
Are you... going to cut
diamond or something next...?

176
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,060
That would be a waste...

177
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,310
You win...

178
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,160
"Alubarna - North Block"

179
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,800
"Alubarna - North Block"
"Battle in front of the Mehdi Assembly Hall"

180
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,050
"Alubarna - North Block"
"Battle in front of the Mehdi Assembly Hall"
"Winner: Zoro"

181
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:26,740
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

182
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:32,700
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

183
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,920
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

184
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,380
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

185
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:50,590
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

186
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:56,060
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

187
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,820
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

188
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,610
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

189
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,820
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

190
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,840
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

191
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,830
A never-ending journey to be together

192
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,420
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

193
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,650
Why're you crying?

194
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,550
Because that mole hag
said that Luffy's dead...

195
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,680
Is that true?!

196
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,180
You guys believe that?

197
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,800
Of course not!

198
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,260
Then stow your snot away.

199
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,600
There's no reason for you to fight any longer!

200
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,190
Surrender right now...! Royal Army!

201
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

202
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,070
"The Battle is Over!
Koza Raises the White Flag"

203
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,330
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
