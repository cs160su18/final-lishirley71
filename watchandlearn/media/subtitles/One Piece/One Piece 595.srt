2
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,050
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,900
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

5
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

6
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,740
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

7
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,470
After landing on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen,

8
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,750
the Straw Hats learned about
the hideous experiments

9
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,340
performed by Caesar Clown, the Master,

10
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,340
and headed off to investigate
but as things got going,

11
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,270
Luffy was unexpectedly
approached by Trafalgar Law.

12
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,770
We're gonna form an alliance
with the Heart Pirates?!

13
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,860
So what we're gonna do is
kidnap the Master, right?

14
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,090
This is the last chance
for you to reconsider.

15
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,610
That's okay. We're with you.

16
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,950
How does it feel to be loose after so long,

17
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,050
Smiley?!

18
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,610
"Capture M!
The Pirate Alliance's Operation Launches!"

19
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,680
THE MOUNTAIN BEHIND THE LABORATORY
PRESENT

20
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,350
Maybe from when I fell?
Looks like I hit my head.

21
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,150
Oh, maybe I did, too. I have a huge headache!

22
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,240
We've wasted so much time.
I wonder if the samurai is okay.

23
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,090
You made us take this side trip.

24
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,890
I thought we all wanted to do this!

25
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,600
It's a shame that we couldn't find the Yeti.

26
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,150
But I'll never forget
the shadows that we saw!

27
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,110
That wasn't it. Don't fool yourself.

28
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,070
You said it was an enemy attack.

29
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,610
No, I didn't.

30
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,990
Yes, you did.

31
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,220
No, I didn't!

32
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,350
I don't believe it exists.

33
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,120
I believe it exists.

34
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,010
I just want to talk about whether
it exists or not forever.

35
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,750
I'm impressed a little.
You're kind of mature.

36
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,510
I'm very old, you know.

37
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,830
I don't like that indecisive attitude.

38
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,540
Hey! Samurai-san!

39
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,270
Where are you?!

40
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,540
If only we could find traces
of his wooden clogs.

41
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,150
So heavy!

42
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,510
My breasts are heavy when I run!

43
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,180
I thought you wanted to save that samurai!

44
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,570
Oh no!

45
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,660
How romantic!

46
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,240
No, fool!

47
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,400
I don't care if you fall down!

48
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,030
Hey, you two! Take a look at this!

49
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,720
There is a footprint!

50
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,220
A trace of his wooden clogs?

51
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,760
It's nothing like that!

52
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,040
Then, it must be some centaur's footprint.

53
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,260
No!

54
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,440
Th-This is...

55
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,380
Look at this! Doesn't this look like
the legendary Yeti's footprint?!

56
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,260
--Hey hey, don't be ridiculous.
--Hey hey, don't be ridiculous.

57
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,140
Wow, is this for real?! There are
mysterious footprints in the snow!

58
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,340
They're huge, aren't they?!
I can't believe it!

59
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,580
And they look fresh!

60
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,000
If we follow them, we will find...

61
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,950
…one of nature's greatest mysteries!

62
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,390
A dead end?

63
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,020
Oh! Look! There are huge shadows behind us!

64
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,990
Don't tell me they're the Yeti...

65
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,050
What is this gas?!

66
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:20,910
All of a zudden, I can't zpeak clearly
az if I kot drunk. I'm tired.

67
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,670
Iz it an enemy attack?!

68
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,260
These KYP gas canisters

69
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,510
make you drunk and drowsy regardless of
whether or not you're a heavy drinker.

70
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,140
Down below the cliff is district F-16
filled with terrible Ice Spikes!

71
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,020
Three, for a starter.

72
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,860
Spikes?!

73
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,700
Hey, guys!

74
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,590
That was close...

75
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,580
We left their bodies at the bottom
of the cliff in district F-16.

76
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,320
Can you recover them?

77
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,300
We arrived at district F-16.

78
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,820
We found three of the Straw Hats as
informed. We'll recover their dead bodies.

79
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,610
Who are you calling dead?!

80
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,230
What?! She's alive!

81
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,410
She's just a girl - she can't fight us...

82
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,580
It doesn't matter if
there're hundreds of you!

83
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,990
You underlings!

84
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,210
I have to be careful.

85
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,800
Nami-san's body is delicate.

86
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,670
I should avoid getting even a single bruise.

87
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,260
Excuse me for having one, Nami-san.

88
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,350
Now...

89
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,270
Wake up, you idiots!

90
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,260
In any case, hunting for
nature's mysteries is over.

91
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,920
Should the samurai be around here?

92
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,170
I think so. He's probably still looking
for his torso around the lake.

93
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,190
We almost made it to the lake.

94
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,340
Samurai-san!

95
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,180
Hey, samurai!

96
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,930
Samurai, come on out!

97
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,890
Samurai!

98
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,060
Did you get your ass kicked already?!

99
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,480
Come on out! Are you alright?! Samurai!

100
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,400
Samurai-san! We're calling you!

101
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,290
I wonder how far he went.

102
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,120
Maybe he found his torso already
and went looking for his son.

103
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,470
Oh?! He's here!

104
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,980
What?!

105
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,180
I can't believe it! He's frozen!

106
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,310
1, 2, 3!

107
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,540
Hey hey, are you alright?

108
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,400
Did someone kick your ass?

109
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,030
I was mysteriously paralyzed
and thought I was gonna die.

110
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,010
You just got caught in a snowstorm
and froze solid, didn't you?

111
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,460
No! I don't feel cold at all...

112
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,980
Don't be so stubborn!

113
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,040
Warriors don't feel cold!

114
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,260
He's such a pain.

115
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,050
Get yourself some clothes!
You have an ability to do that!

116
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,460
T-To tell you the truth,

117
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,900
because of that magic, I have a weakness.

118
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,780
I-I became not capable of swimming...

119
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,340
You can't swim, right?! We know that!

120
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,320
Wh-What I'm trying to say is my torso is...

121
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,740
...p-probably soaking in the water!

122
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,780
The water?

123
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,010
I-In fact,

124
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,930
it feels like the upper half
of my body is in the water.

125
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,780
I see. That's why you couldn't even
move and you were frozen here.

126
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,090
If your body's in the water,
you can't use the power.

127
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,530
Speaking of water, Brook, his torso
may have fallen into the lake.

128
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,490
Maybe. I heard that lake is
actually filled with seawater.

129
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:50,210
He's still alive here so I don't think
it has become food for sharks yet.

130
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,440
But we don't know what's in that lake.

131
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,420
We better pull it out as soon as possible.

132
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,710
Yes, we have to hurry.

133
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:03,590
I-I have to ask you to... um,
go under the water for me...

134
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,010
We know! You can't swim,
right? What a crappy samurai!

135
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,090
I thought you people were pirates!
And I'm a total stranger to you!

136
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,480
Why are you helping me so much?!

137
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,120
Because I'm responsible for you!

138
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,080
But when you get your whole body back,

139
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,260
you have to fight me! I'll kick your ass!

140
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,870
I...

141
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,790
I accept it!

142
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,140
Thank you!

143
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,240
Oh great! Now you're able to say thank you.

144
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,430
Maybe getting frozen makes people nicer.

145
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,150
What?

146
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,650
Hmm... What is that?

147
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,740
Oh! Those are...

148
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,780
...Brownbeard-san's subordino-centaurs
that we robbed.

149
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,530
--Stay with me! Keep running!
--Get away from the lake!

150
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,870
A monster appeared on the other side!

151
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,770
We have to tell the Master!

152
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,630
Where has it been hiding
on the island until now?!

153
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,420
Just keep running! It's gonna come after us!

154
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,260
Huh, a monster? You guys are monsters.

155
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,300
They're the pirates who robbed us earlier!

156
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,800
Dammit! That's my coat!

157
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,790
Forget about them! Just run! To the lab!

158
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,020
They got our Boss!

159
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,240
You'll pay for that!

160
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,800
What's going on?

161
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,960
I don't know. What was it?

162
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,040
Hey, Brook. They were coming from the
lake that we saw earlier, weren't they?

163
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,590
What?! Yes! You got it right!

164
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,250
I'm impressed, Zoro-san! And what about it?

165
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,490
Well, if in fact that is the lake,

166
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,480
I don't think there was a mountain
there before, was there?

167
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,060
A mountain?

168
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,560
Wh-What the hell is that?!

169
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,380
Smiley is the embodiment of a
chemical weapon explosion...

170
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,940
...that occurred on Punk
Hazard, four years ago.

171
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,360
I invented the H2S poison gas bomb.

172
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,110
It worked so well

173
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,570
and killed everything on the
island in a matter of seconds!

174
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,270
ONE YEAR LATER

175
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,590
Do they believe I purified
the gas all over the island?

176
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,490
No way! No one would do
such a wasteful thing!

177
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,840
I compressed it and turned it into a monster.

178
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,270
And there he is!

179
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,170
Smiley!

180
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,840
This island was once covered with
dead soil where no one could live.

181
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,090
People tend to forget tragedies in no time

182
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,650
but that one has lingered here all along.

183
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,310
It was always in my hand!

184
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,400
VEGAPUNK'S FORMER THIRD LABORATORY

185
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,000
THE REMAINS OF VEGAPUNK'S
FORMER FIRST AND SECOND LABORATORY

186
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,800
I'll never let him take these children again.

187
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,190
I can't believe he was using them as
his test subjects and drugged them.

188
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,640
I can't forgive the Master guy!

189
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,750
Okay, then let's just go
and kidnap the Master!

190
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,490
Yeah, if we're too late,
we can't work with them.

191
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,150
We're not gonna be late. I have an idea!

192
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,910
What is it?

193
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,210
It's a very good idea!

194
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,370
We got their ship!

195
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,380
Stop the ship!

196
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,090
Hurry up! Let's finish them off!

197
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,060
S-Smoker-san, how can I turn back?!

198
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,180
You're in my way! Stay still, Tashigi!

199
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,230
The door is not open yet?!

200
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,720
The enemy is in the lab!

201
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,460
We can't just stay out here!

202
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,320
It's no good! The door is as
steady as a rock, Smo-san!

203
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,870
I feel miserable!

204
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:52,960
If I were in my body, I could easily
force myself into the place!

205
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,400
Room.

206
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,750
Your power is very useful!
Was it teleportation?!

207
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,100
Shut up and stay inside the bag.

208
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,330
We've almost reached the backdoor of the lab.

209
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,460
Caesar will probably be in the
main room with that woman.

210
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,190
I'll try to draw them out of the room.

211
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,350
I want you to find out about
the drug while we're gone.

212
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,390
But if you can reach the Master that easily

213
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,940
and you're so strong, why don't
you capture the Master yourself?

214
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,080
Then we can take time to
find out about the drug.

215
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,490
Because of a problem I have,

216
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,240
I can't do that and that's why
I need help from you guys.

217
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,200
In any case, I just want
you guys to kidnap Caesar.

218
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,670
I'll do the rest.

219
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,750
Hey, look at that!

220
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,630
Wh-What's that?!

221
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,430
--Something's flying toward us!
--It's a big bomb!

222
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,470
No, it's not!

223
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,540
Cien Fleurs!

224
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,530
Wing!

225
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,980
Wham!

226
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,830
What?! He said "Wham"?! Is it a human?!

227
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,350
Hot damn!

228
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,070
That was a nice shortcut!

229
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,590
Master, show yourself!

230
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,070
We will kick your ass and kidnap you!

231
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,320
Luffy, that was supposed to be a secret.

232
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,830
Straw Hat!

233
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,330
It's the Straw Hats!

234
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,460
Go, Luffy!

235
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,130
That fool! Who said anything
about confronting everyone?!

236
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,180
Where are you, Master?!

237
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,010
Show yourself!

238
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,130
A battle unfolds between Smoker's G-5 Navy men and Luffy's crew.

239
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,930
After the violent clash, just when it seems like the research lab will be breached...

240
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,210
...Caesar's deadly weapon, Smiley, rains down upon person after person...

241
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,390
...throwing everyone into fear and chaos.

242
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

243
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,360
"On the Verge of Annihilation!
A Deadly Monster Comes Flying In!"

244
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
