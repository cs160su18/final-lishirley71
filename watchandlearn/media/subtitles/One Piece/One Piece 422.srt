2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,730
To rescue his brother Ace who
has been captured by the navy,

50
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,490
Luffy stowed away on a navy ship with
the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock's help

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,700
and headed to the Great
Prison - Impel Down!

52
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,410
Meanwhile, the rest
of the Straw Hats

53
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,620
had been sent to separate
islands by Bartholomew Kuma.

54
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,380
As time ticks down for the
public execution of Ace,

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,920
tensions at Navy
Headquarters are rising

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,930
and preparations for
war are underway.

57
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,230
Nobody can stop it now.

58
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,190
We made the
king of the sea...

59
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,610
...angry!

60
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,680
"A Deadly Infiltration! The
Underwater Prison Impel Down!"

61
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,530
I wanted you and Luffy to
become good marines.

62
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,090
But instead, both of you brothers
have become notorious hoodlums.

63
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,980
I'm sure that you
heard about Luffy.

64
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,660
He picked a fight with the World
Government at Water Seven

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,560
and destroyed the Judgement
Island - Enies Lobby!

66
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,940
I rushed there and gave him
some tough-love with this fist

67
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,570
but he didn't
learn even a little.

68
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,170
So he went and made a big
mess at Sabaody Archipelago.

69
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,590
I'm so proud of
my grandson!

70
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,170
Oh yeah. I told Luffy
about his father.

71
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,670
A father? Do I have a father?

72
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,580
Your father's name is
Monkey D. Dragon!

73
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,930
He's a revolutionary!

74
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,050
Luffy was surprised to
know about his father.

75
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,010
It doesn't matter to us at all.

76
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,820
Because Luffy and
I unfortunately

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,320
have the blood of the world's most
infamous criminals in our veins anyway.

78
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,280
There was no way for
us to become marines.

79
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,960
I took over the name "Portgaz" from
my mother to whom I owe so much

80
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,520
but I never wanted to have my
good-for-nothing father's blood.

81
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,770
Because I don't have any memory of
him and I don't owe anything to him.

82
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,230
Ah yeah, I understand
but he tried...

83
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,600
What I want to say is...

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,640
Old man,

85
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,750
You are too valuable
to let die now, boy.

86
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,990
Run as wild as you want
on the sea under my name.

87
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,510
You are my son from now!

88
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,580
My only father is...

89
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,500
Whitebeard!

90
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,300
Vice Admiral Momonga!
I see a pirate ship!

91
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,180
Whose ship is that?

92
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,700
That mark... I've
seen it before...

93
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,670
I'll look into it!

94
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,910
If you don't remember, they
must not be a big deal.

95
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,000
Let them go! There is no
time to waste on this trip.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,810
Yes, sir!

97
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,440
Ahh! Look over there!
It's a big Sea King!

98
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,750
If he targets us, he can eat
this whole ship with one bite.

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,490
Please don't notice us!

100
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,150
He's gone.

101
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,790
W-We came all this way but

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,040
there is nothing
we can do now.

103
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,830
What should we do
now, Sister Alvida?!

104
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,590
Don't ask me what to do!

105
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,810
It's you guys who
wanted to come here

106
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,790
and who spent a fortune
on an Eternal Pose.

107
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:25,480
B-Because we really wanted to save Captain
Buggy who has been taken to Impel Down!

108
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,860
Look at the sea!

109
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,020
We're about to enter the Calm Belt
where monsters have their nests.

110
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,780
You think this ship
can sail there?

111
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,750
But there is only one other course
and that's exclusively for the Navy.

112
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,170
They're not gonna open the
Gate of Justice for a pirate ship.

113
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,800
No way! We can't
even get there?!

114
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,680
If nothing is done, Captain
Buggy will be executed!

115
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,050
...Along with his
friend Ace-kun!

116
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,460
Richie! Look at how sad he is
thinking about the Captain!

117
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,970
Impel Down is the greatest
prison in the world

118
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,390
and it's impossible to
break in or break out.

119
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,620
You better just give up.

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,250
Buggy the Clown's luck
as a pirate has run out.

121
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,330
That can't be true!

122
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,660
This is not the way
Captain Buggy will die!

123
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,990
Yeah! Until the day he finds
Captain John's treasure island

124
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,180
which he has been searching
for with all his heart,

125
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,360
we're gonna stand
by Captain Buggy!

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,410
Captain Buggy!

127
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,350
What a compassionate
lion you are!

128
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,380
Richie!

129
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,090
Alright, have fun!

130
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,970
I'll take this Big Top so
you guys take a boat.

131
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,370
What?!

132
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,460
No way! This is
Captain Buggy's ship!

133
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,380
But Buggy is not here!

134
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,880
Oh, that's true.

135
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm not going to march
up to death's doorstep -

136
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,790
and I won't let you
waste this ship.

137
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,350
You guys can chase after
Buggy to your heart's content.

138
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,470
We'll never stop
following our Captain!

139
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,060
Whether it's to the great
prison or the end of the world!

140
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,260
Yeah!

141
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,110
I have a feeling that you're gonna
die before you even see Impel Down.

142
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,030
Captain Buggy! Thank
you for everything!

143
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,650
We won't forget what
you've done for us!

144
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,760
Have a peaceful
execution! Goodbye!

145
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,130
See you in next life!

146
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,540
I can feel your grief, Richie!

147
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,620
This is Momonga,
marine code G100660.

148
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,190
We are about to sail on the current
so prepare to open the Gate!

149
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,190
The navy ship that Luffy
and Hancock are on

150
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,900
is approaching
the Tub Current

151
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,960
which is exclusively
used by the Navy

152
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,910
and connects three of the
government's central facilities.

153
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,880
"The Great Underwater Prison
Impel Down"

154
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,660
Just kill me!

155
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,100
Hey, new guy!

156
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:22,510
How come you're eating without first
paying respect to our cell leader?

157
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,840
Should I say hello every
time I eat something?

158
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,960
Don't be ridiculous!

159
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,200
There's a rule that a newcomer
should give his food to the boss!

160
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,070
That will learn ya!

161
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,550
H-Hey, wait a minute! That
was just a little disagreement!

162
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,680
We're not on death
row! Get us out of here!

163
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,570
It has been four and half days since they
left the Maiden Island - Amazon Lily.

164
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,160
Vice Admiral Momonga! We
are arriving at Impel Down!

165
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,820
Hurry and open the Gate!

166
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,200
Aye-aye, sir!

167
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,390
This is the world's
greatest prison!

168
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,240
We were delayed a bit
because of head winds

169
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,960
but we have arrived
at Impel Down!

170
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,200
Oh boy! We have to hurry!

171
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,250
Get Hancock now!

172
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,030
Yes, sir!

173
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,780
Hancock-dono! We are here!

174
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,910
I'll be right out.

175
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,120
What the hell?! They have more navy ships
here than when they did the Buster Call!

176
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,830
This is the most dangerous
place in the world

177
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,620
so this is necessary.

178
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,090
But - you saw
the Buster Call?

179
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,430
I know it only by
what I've heard.

180
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,810
It was an all-out attack by five vice
admirals with a fleet of ten ships,

181
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,230
and the strongest military
operation by the Navy.

182
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,360
Is this where Ace is?

183
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,060
I think he is being
held deep underwater.

184
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,030
Now, get into my cloak.

185
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,050
Thank you for coming,
Vice Admiral Momonga!

186
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,050
W-Wow! L-L-Look at her!

187
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,900
That's the pirate empress! She's the
most beautiful woman in the world!

188
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,530
Her beauty has no limit!

189
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,250
How many volts is the power of
her beauty?! 10,000? 1,000,000?

190
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,160
What's that noise?
It hurts my ears.

191
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,460
Can I turn them to stone?

192
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,610
Please don't.

193
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,480
The Navy can't take
any more humiliation.

194
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,070
Are we already inside?

195
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,250
Not yet.

196
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,680
Don't rush, Luffy.

197
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,000
The condition
you named was

198
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,820
to see the key figure of this whole
mess, Portgaz D. Ace, wasn't it?

199
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,580
Like I told you the other day,

200
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,320
pirates are not welcomed here
even though you're a Warlord.

201
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,230
So we'll put handcuffs made
of Sea Prism Stone on you

202
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,330
and we'll conduct a strict
body search before you go in.

203
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,740
Because we don't want any ploys
to free any of our prisoners.

204
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,090
Luffy, they'll
search my body.

205
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,970
I'll figure out a
way. Just go on.

206
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,930
I don't mind.

207
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,390
What?! Buggy the Clown
has vanished from his cell?

208
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,790
He ate a Devil Fruit?

209
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:17,290
Vice Warden! Vice Admiral Momonga and
Hancock-dono of the Seven Warlords arrived.

210
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,160
Alright, I'll be there.

211
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,680
Wow, c-c-cute! Open
the gate please!

212
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,740
Open it fully! Give her space!

213
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,810
Here we go, Luffy!

214
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,600
Take care!

215
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,660
Hancock-sama!
Have a nice visit!

216
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,130
Shut up, you idiots!

217
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,850
Don't be so mean!
And take care!

218
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,700
Help me!

219
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,830
S-S-Somebody!

220
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,880
Get me out!

221
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,130
What a dark atmosphere!
This must be hell.

222
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,310
Finally, we got in! But
we're not in the clear yet.

223
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,600
Welcome to my Impel Down!

224
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,690
Oh, I got it wrong! I said
"my" - jumping the gun!

225
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,610
I'm still the vice warden,
Hannyabal. Nice to meet you!

226
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,370
I'm Momonga.

227
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,270
I knew that you were coming.

228
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,470
And you're Empress
Hancock-dono?

229
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,590
You're my Empress
Hancock-dono?

230
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,590
Oh no, I'm sorry! That
was over-ambitious!

231
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,370
The dumb-ass-warden...
Oh, sorry!

232
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:07,930
The Warden Magellan is in his office on
level 4 and I would like you to meet him.

233
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,770
Vice Jail Manager Domino
and I will guide you.

234
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,030
It seems like you are in a rush so
let me ask you to come this way.

235
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,860
Vice Admiral-dono, you can go that way.
I'm afraid I have to conduct a body search.

236
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,830
If you were a prisoner, we'd ask you to go inside
of this cell and take off all of your clothes,

237
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,790
then we'd push you into an iron pot filled with
"the warm water of hell" boiling at 200 degrees

238
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,040
to receive your baptism and get sterilized at
the same time and you would be ready to enter.

239
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,880
There are different
classes of prisoners.

240
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,390
Among all recent
newcomers, "Fire Fist" Ace,

241
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,930
Jimbei of the Seven Warlords
and the former Warlord Crocodile

242
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,940
didn't turn a hair while receiving baptism
and entered prison very smoothly.

243
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,690
Please come in. We search guests
in a private room so don't worry.

244
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,380
I'd like you to take
off your cloak.

245
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,830
Those are well-suited for hide
something inside so I'll take it here.

246
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,380
It's not like I don't trust you but you
better not do anything suspicious.

247
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,430
Surveillance Transponder Snails are
everywhere inside of Impel Down

248
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,310
and they keep sending video
to the surveillance monitors.

249
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,820
Wow! This is the
pirate empress!

250
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,160
She's as beautiful
as they say!

251
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,260
Snails! Let me see
Hancock-sama more clearly!

252
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,910
Close-up! Zoom
in for a close-up!

253
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,910
Wow! Cute!

254
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,750
Now, let's just start.

255
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,790
Let me put these Sea Prism
Stone handcuffs on you.

256
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,270
I'm not a prisoner but
you put handcuffs on me.

257
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,260
You couldn't be more careful.

258
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,990
Public execution of Ace...

259
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,990
...is in 33 hours!

260
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,670
Luffy parts ways with Hancock and
infiltrates the prison alone.

261
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,670
He slips through the guard
to search for Ace's floor,

262
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,210
but he finds it harder than he
thought to penetrate Impel Down's

263
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,990
iron-tight security.

264
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,260
Just then, that man with
the red nose appears!

265
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

266
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,680
"A Reunion in Hell?! The Man
Who Ate the Chop-Chop Fruit!"

267
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,080
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
