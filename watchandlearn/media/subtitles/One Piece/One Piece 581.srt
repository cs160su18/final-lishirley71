00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,900
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,260
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,660
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

72
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

73
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

74
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,080
After surviving a fierce battle,

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,500
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,980
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

77
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,300
Responding to an emergency signal,

78
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,430
Luffy and the others went to Punk
Hazard and there, they faced...

79
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,650
Bu! It's strange but it's cool here!

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,170
You're not gonna believe this!

81
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,110
Somebody's stuck in the dragon's back!

82
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,120
One-Sword...

83
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,820
...Style!

84
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,280
Lion Strike!

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,450
Meanwhile, Nami and the others were...

86
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,630
Tie them all up!

87
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
Alright!

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,300
It's good that they're pirates.

89
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,220
No one will care if they go missing.

90
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,020
Let's take them to the Master!

91
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,020
"The Straw Hats Stunned! Enter: A
Samurai's Horrifying Severed Head!"

92
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,160
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND

93
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,990
THE BURNING LANDS

94
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,160
Now, what should we do about him?

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,820
Let's pull him out!

96
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,220
Hey, who are you?!

97
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,570
Get your hands off of me-bu!

98
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,930
Hey! I'm helping you! Stay calm!

99
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,410
Here we go!

100
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,090
Wow, he's completely stuck
in the dragon's body.

101
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,960
How is that possible?

102
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,340
His upper body is stuck but
he's talking normally.

103
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,500
Why isn't he suffocating?

104
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,360
Who the hell is he?

105
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,350
I-I-It's missing!

106
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,500
What's missing?

107
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,760
He's torn in half! I'm sorry!

108
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,590
You fool! Sorry isn't
enough!  You killed him!

109
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,690
Oh, I'm finally separated from it-bu!

110
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,560
What?!

111
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,690
The lower body just talked! What's going on?!

112
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,220
A zombie! A monster!

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,730
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,910
This is strange.

115
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,910
There is no upper half here.

116
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,800
What do you mean?

117
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,540
He didn't have an upper
body from the very start?

118
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,580
Oh, this is too freaky!

119
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,210
He's kind of big.

120
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,310
Who is there and what are you doing?

121
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,750
I sense your presence but
I don't have eyes or ears.

122
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,930
You're bizarre!

123
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,980
I don't know who you are
but get out of my way-bu!

124
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,020
What?

125
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,440
I cannot die here!

126
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,490
Oh, he took off!

127
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm not going to let them get away!

128
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,580
That goddamn Warlord!

129
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,450
Hey, wait! Why don't you join my...

130
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,290
No, Luffy!

131
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,290
I'm gonna go catch him!

132
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,130
Can you grill the dragon for me?!

133
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,220
Wait, legs!

134
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
Luffy is so whimsical.

135
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,090
Why does he like that monster so much?

136
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,350
It troubles me that he
mentioned the Seven Warlords.

137
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,390
Does it mean one of the Seven
Warlords is here on this island too?

138
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,920
Oh no! That's too much trouble!

139
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,900
We don't wanna face the Warlords!

140
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,760
It's not too late!

141
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,200
Can we go back?

142
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,290
Hey!

143
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,460
Wait, legs!

144
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,420
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

145
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,540
What is he doing?

146
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,760
Hey!

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,220
There's a wall!

148
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,760
Who is it?!

149
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,930
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

150
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,270
Why did you do it-bu?

151
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,120
Who is it?

152
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,560
I know someone's after me.

153
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,270
But for some reason,

154
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,010
I don't feel any hostile intent.

155
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,280
He's fast.

156
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,450
Bu! I don't know who you are but
what do you want from me-bu?

157
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,790
If you stand in my way, I'll fight you!

158
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,200
Stand in your way?

159
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,850
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,920
Cut that crap and join my crew!

161
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,250
Bu! What are you doing-bu?!

162
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,430
Gotcha!

163
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,560
Let me go-bu!

164
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,100
Now, why don't you join...

165
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,400
...my crew?!

166
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,570
Sorry!

167
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,970
Oh, that was surprising!

168
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,130
Hey legs, are you alright?

169
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,870
What the...?!

170
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,100
And you ended up like that?

171
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,400
Yep, that's right.

172
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,340
Oh, this dragon meat is yummy!

173
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,730
What do you call someone like this, Usopp?

174
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,940
Huh?

175
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,570
Um...

176
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,990
I think it's called...

177
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,950
...a centaur, maybe?

178
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,330
A centaur?

179
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,300
How funny!

180
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,590
First, he was stuck to the
dragon's body and now Luffy's?

181
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,880
What's wrong with him?

182
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,850
How do you like it?

183
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,810
Damn! I'm stuck in something again-bu!

184
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,050
Let me go-bu!

185
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,870
That's vulgar, Luffy.

186
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,210
Is it?

187
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,220
What's this?!

188
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,290
See? He's not gonna just go along with you.

189
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,310
There's no such creature!

190
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,590
I bet his upper half is looking for him.

191
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,000
Give him back to his owner!

192
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,740
Where's your sense of adventure, Usopp?

193
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,950
He was born like this. Right?

194
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,080
Oh, so he's naturally a
half-body... No, I don't buy it!

195
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,570
What's your name?

196
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,190
Hey, I know you're gonna eat most

197
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,780
of this dragon meat so
why don't you carry it?!

198
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,970
Hey, guys! Come and take a look at this.

199
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,720
Oh, Zoro! Is the samurai
and the guy who got cut?

200
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,800
Look.

201
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,150
What is it?

202
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,490
What?! S-Snowcapped mountains?!

203
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,450
No, are those mountains of ice?

204
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,960
There is a big lake in the middle
and there are snowcapped

205
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,000
mountains on the other side!

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,550
But on this side, there is an active
volcano and it's burning hot!

207
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,630
What kind of island is this?!

208
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,130
So one of the mysteries is solved.

209
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,850
Huh? Oh yeah, the man on
the Snail said he was cold!

210
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,270
Help me!

211
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,730
What happened?

212
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,900
It's cold... Is this the Boss?!

213
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,030
My colleagues are getting
cut one after another!

214
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,490
The samurai are gonna kill us!

215
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,030
It means the killer samurai and
the victims are on the other side!

216
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,790
This island is so interesting!

217
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,980
There is snow on those mountains, huh?

218
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,570
It's so hot here - I wanna eat a snowcone!

219
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,660
We're not gonna go there! It's too cold!

220
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,720
And it's a long way. Let's
go back to the ship for now.

221
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,760
Oh no, it's gonna be cold this time.

222
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,560
If there are animals, we
could make coats from pelts.

223
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,990
But it's gonna be okay.

224
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,380
No, it's not gonna be okay!

225
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,520
How can you guys go along with this?!

226
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,530
Snowcone!

227
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,470
Hey, I said "Wait"! Luffy!

228
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,440
Oh, you two are going too?!

229
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm not going at any cost!

230
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,250
There's no immediate threat to
my life here but over there,

231
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,210
I'll freeze to death.

232
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,490
I'm not gonna...

233
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,720
A monster!

234
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,450
No!!!

235
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,290
Ouch! What're you...

236
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,050
I saw... I saw a monster!
A bird! No, a human!

237
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,050
A bird or a human, which was it?!

238
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,300
Huh? What are you talking
about? Nobody's there!

239
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,230
Huh?

240
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,380
Gee! Hey, let's go!

241
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,120
No, believe me! There was
somebody just a minute ago!

242
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,030
Believe me!

243
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,580
I'm here to report, Master.

244
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,840
We seized intruders.

245
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,030
I assume they are pirates.

246
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,330
Oh, that is perfect.

247
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,330
We were running low on guinea pigs.

248
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,200
Well, well... They all look
unique and interesting.

249
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,940
They're gonna be good test subjects.

250
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,080
Yes, I thought  you would
especially like this cyborg.

251
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,750
Oh, what a rare find!

252
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,830
He is worth testing. You're
right. I can't wait.

253
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,700
Will this be all?

254
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,320
It seems there was another man who
looked like one of them but...

255
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,100
I assume they had a falling
out and he was murdered.

256
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,560
All that remained was his skeleton.

257
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,420
Such brutality is not so unusual for pirates.

258
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,530
I see. All right.

259
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,350
I want you to lock them in a room
and make sure they can't escape.

260
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,240
Let's see what they have here.

261
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,380
Look for food or something usable.

262
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,430
Yes, sir.

263
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,990
Oh? What was I doing?

264
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,020
Where are Nami-san and the others?

265
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,560
Who are those people?

266
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,360
It was very hot before

267
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,900
but it became extremely
cold while I was sleeping.

268
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,040
Who is it?!

269
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,970
Are you one of those pirates?!

270
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,710
It's bone-chillingly cold, isn't it?

271
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,190
Oh, I'm a skeleton - that's why.

272
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,460
Th-The skeletonized body said something!

273
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,060
I don't know who you are but do you know

274
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,930
where Nami-san and the others went?

275
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,080
S-Shoot! Shoot!

276
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,190
Huh? No, wait, you guys! Don't be so rash!

277
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,070
Sanji, what are you messing around with?

278
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,970
Oh, you're up.

279
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,350
Can't you see?

280
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,220
Oh no, Franky! We are locked up!

281
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,250
Hey, what's this place?! Where are we?!

282
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,530
I was eating a Giant Shellfish
dessert on the deck and...

283
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,590
I can't remember anything after that!

284
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I assume that somebody used sleeping gas

285
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,370
and seized us once we fell asleep.

286
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,730
What?

287
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,260
The ship was, in fact, filled with gas.

288
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,620
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,630
I wish I could've noticed it a little sooner.

290
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,070
What should we do?

291
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,900
Are they gonna sell us?!
Are they abducting humans?!

292
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
But if they took all of us
on the ship, where's Brook?

293
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,250
I don't know.

294
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,160
There are only four of us in here.

295
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,450
If they're abducting humans,
they wouldn't need a skeleton.

296
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,040
You're not a human either.

297
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,960
Neither are you! That's enough!

298
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,130
You guys.

299
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,130
Did anybody say something?

300
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,420
No, it wasn't us.

301
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,020
Do you guys like hanjimono?

302
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,390
That means "puzzles" in a foreign language.

303
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,770
Was it this thing that just talked?

304
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
What is it?

305
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,360
Don't call me an "it"!

306
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,530
It's...

307
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,940
What? A bug?

308
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,960
A new kind of Transponder Snail?

309
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,790
There are eight of them! I hadn't noticed!

310
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,810
I'm not a bug!

311
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,920
You guys don't seem like bad people.

312
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,220
These are all parts of my face.

313
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,930
Could I ask you to put them back together?

314
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,480
Your face?

315
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,020
Oh yeah, this is a mouth.

316
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,520
And this is an eye.

317
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,020
Like this?

318
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,830
--How is it?!
--Yeah, looks like a face now!

319
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,650
No no, you left out some parts!

320
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,860
I think it's like this!

321
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,000
How about this?

322
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,780
It's completely wrong!

323
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,870
No no, this is better.

324
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,400
Alright, that's fine.

325
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,880
No! No!

326
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,860
I wanna try it too!

327
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,130
You guys! Stop playing with my face!

328
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,030
It's done!

329
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,100
Looks like a human face now!

330
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,310
I think there is something
wrong with the chin

331
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,980
and the top part but it's okay.

332
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,060
Thank you!

333
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,070
A severed-head just talked!

334
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,770
You just noticed?

335
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,940
How can you live like
that?! Are you possessed?!

336
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,700
I don't know. I didn't
wish to become like this.

337
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,660
That bastard... He used
some kind of weird magic!

338
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,270
I thought I was dead when he cut
me but I ended up like this.

339
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,210
To be kept alive after
being sliced apart is...

340
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,090
...a dishonor to a warrior!

341
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,590
It seems like crossing the lake

342
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,560
is the only way to get to the other side.

343
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,160
But how do we cross the lake?

344
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,860
I don't know if we can live long enough
to get to the lake in the first place.

345
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,700
It's hot!

346
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,990
Snowcone!

347
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,200
I wonder how Luffy can be so high-spirited.

348
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,210
Snowcone! Snowcone! Snowcone!

349
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:21,880
Who goes there?!

350
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,260
There you are, intruders!

351
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,100
Huh?!

352
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,690
You have...

353
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,020
...those...

354
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,230
...legs!

355
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,190
They are so cool!

356
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,680
Oh, I'm sorry!

357
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,790
I was looking for intruders and
I saw some unfamiliar faces so...

358
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,710
Oh, okay! You surprised me!

359
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,340
By the way, your legs are cool too!

360
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,550
Yeah! Your hind legs are a little different.

361
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,910
You think so?

362
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,460
Where am I-bu!

363
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,520
Hey, calm down!

364
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,140
Your hind legs can talk?!

365
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,030
Yeah!

366
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,590
Awesome! None of my friends
have legs like that!

367
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,900
--I've never seen it before!
--Yeah?

368
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,760
So, Luffy made an odd friend again.

369
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,240
A panther centaur?

370
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,360
One, two...

371
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,570
...three...

372
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,960
...and four.

373
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,180
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

374
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,960
Clank.

375
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,820
Hello? Did you find them?

376
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,390
Yes, we found them. We
were about to kill them.

377
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,560
There are four intruders.

378
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,490
I see.

379
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,440
That's exciting.

380
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,130
Please be careful!

381
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,340
Roger.

382
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
Clank.

383
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,620
Luffy and the crew face a new crisis

384
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,520
while they cross the burning lands.

385
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,920
After Sanji and the others hear what
the bodiless samurai has to say,

386
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,410
they escape together from their cell.

387
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,900
While being pursued, they wander into a room,

388
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,390
and discover a terrifying
secret hidden on the island!

389
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

390
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,780
"Startling! The Secret of the
Island is Finally Revealed!"

391
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
