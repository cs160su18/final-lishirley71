2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,980
In order to become brothers
of the legendary pirate Shiki,

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,320
the Amigo Pirates came to the
island to catch the big beetle!

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,160
If you don't wanna get killed,
let us have the beetle!

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,910
The giant beetle doesn't want to join
a pirate crew! Just give up on him!

53
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,750
You got me wrong, stupid!

54
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,290
I'm here to catch him!

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,350
Mucho Needle Net!

56
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,680
Ow, ow, ow... Ouch!

57
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,940
Luffy!

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,560
Even if you are a rubberman, I will
not let you get away with it, senor!

59
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,980
"A Special Presentation Related to the Movie!
The Fierce Onslaught of the Amigo Pirates!"

60
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,870
I can't believe this!

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,070
There's no way to defeat her!

62
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,910
You won sixty-nine out of sixty-nine...

63
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,970
Robin-san, you're so good at it.

64
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,860
Hmm... I don't think that it's
possible to make such a clean sweep!

65
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,730
Oh? Are you suspecting that I
cheated? Do you have any proof?

66
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,800
Well...

67
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,110
What was that?!

68
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,750
It must be from behind the mountain.

69
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,470
Do you think Nami-san and others are okay?

70
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,740
Maybe they're having a hard
time catching the beetle.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,030
Let's go help them!

72
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,470
"Big Bro"?

73
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,930
Are they related?

74
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,440
Ow!

75
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,610
Augh! What is this?! It's all tangled up!

76
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,330
Damn you!

77
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,100
There's no use in doing that.

78
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,280
The more you struggle,
the tighter the net gets.

79
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,510
Choking to death like that at your age...

80
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,260
...makes me think how
cruel this world can be...

81
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,970
You're the vice captain of
the Amigo Pirates, right?

82
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,980
How would you explain
this shameful situation?

83
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,650
Oh, I'm sorry! I heard the big beetle
is the guardian of this island

84
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,660
so we tried to give them a scare
and make them bring out the beetle

85
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,030
but then that guy stepped in!

86
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,200
A big beetle? Oh, I thought
we're here for a stag beetle.

87
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,040
You never pay attention! How many
times do I have to tell you?!

88
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,440
It's a beetle! A big beetle!

89
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,710
Yeah?

90
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,050
Then maybe the beetle that
I saw on the way here

91
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,480
was the one you're talking about...

92
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,430
Whaaat?!

93
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh, shoot!

94
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,400
You have to keep moving!

95
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,380
Boss! Can you hear me? Boss!

96
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,340
Where did you see it, Big Bro?!

97
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,410
Hmmm... I think it was around there.

98
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,410
Alright then, let's just...

99
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,830
We can catch that crappy beetle any time.

100
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,960
So...

101
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,280
Let's give them an ultimatum: either let
have the beetle or face extermination.

102
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,340
That was a good idea which is rare for you.

103
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,150
Let's just go with it!

104
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,730
I didn't say "extermination"...

105
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,060
Ah, in addition to that,

106
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:52,240
we should get rid of those two who're
having been glaring at us so rudely.

107
00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:00,000
You two! How would you like to
die by my Net-Net Fruit power

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,990
which has a capture rate of 120%?

109
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,010
Oh no! Really?

110
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,550
Alright, bring it on, swordsman!

111
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,520
Hundred-and-Eight Pound Phoenix!

112
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,060
You bastard!

113
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,650
A flying sword attack! Now I'm wide-awake!

114
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,610
Mucho Sticky Net!

115
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,030
I can't cut it!

116
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,580
Not done yet!

117
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,990
Sticky Net Network!

118
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,210
W-What the...?!

119
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,010
What's this?! It's so sticky!

120
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,760
Come on! Come on! Come on!

121
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,070
Oh, shit!

122
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,430
What're you doing, stupid?!

123
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,570
Next up, what do you do for living?

124
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,020
I'm a good cook, you crappy net geek!

125
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,430
Well then, how about something
boiling hot? Colt.

126
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,970
Okay!

127
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,490
Aak! Ow, ow, ow...!

128
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,620
What a fool! You think drinking
hot water will help you?!

129
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,250
Whew, that was hot.

130
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,500
Okay, let's do it!

131
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,270
Million Boiling Net!

132
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,150
You bastard! Stop messing around
with those stupid attacks!

133
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,530
Let my friends go!

134
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,510
That kind of friendship gets me choked up.

135
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,020
You know that you can't beat me...

136
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,790
Mucho Iron Net!

137
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,880
What's this?!

138
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,150
This is crap!

139
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,470
Damn it!

140
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,960
He got all three! These
guys are the real deal!

141
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,100
I told you!

142
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,600
What the swordsman got was the
basic sticky net and there is...

143
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,900
...iron, hot water,

144
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,670
and then here is fire!

145
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,070
Aak! Ow, ow, ow, ouch!

146
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,460
I can turn everything that I ingest to nets

147
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,810
and capture something with a 120%
success rate that is my Net-Net power!

148
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,950
But you still challenged me...

149
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,180
It's so sad to see someone
who doesn't know his limits!

150
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,390
Now, it's your turn!

151
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,140
I wanna see you do your very worst.

152
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,940
You can count on it!

153
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,730
Alright, you guys! I heard that...

154
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,070
...you are all from the East Blue.

155
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,780
I'm gonna tell you weak
sea idiots once again!

156
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,740
Let us have the beetle!

157
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,380
I'm gonna picking you off
one by one from the end!

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,360
If you don't wanna die,
just tell me where it is!

159
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,470
Stop it!

160
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,770
Yoko! Don't be fool!

161
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,890
I'll fight you!

162
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,820
A Navy coat?! Is she a brand new recruit?!

163
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,630
Oh, senorita!

164
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,160
You stand against us with a
bamboo sword? Are you nuts?

165
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,830
Shut up! This is all I need...

166
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,580
...to beat you guys!

167
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,120
Oh no!

168
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,870
--Shoot her!
--Yes!

169
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,460
Yoko!

170
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,350
Boss!

171
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,520
So that must be the Shiki's big beetle!

172
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,480
Yeah, it is very big!

173
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,560
Oh no, it was just about to get exciting...

174
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,850
--Here he comes!
--Go, Boss!

175
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,620
Beat them up, Boss!

176
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,740
Yes! Get them!

177
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,160
Giant Beetle!

178
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,010
Shoot it! Shoot it!

179
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,940
Nice!

180
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,070
Boss!

181
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,950
Big Bro, the nets! Please!

182
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,700
No fun... This is no fun at all...

183
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,900
I was about to see a mucho mucho beautiful

184
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,180
inferno colored by despair and screams...

185
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,710
Big Bro, hurry!

186
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,300
Oh, he's so annoying. Doesn't
he know that he's just a pest?

187
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,160
Mucho Burning Net!

188
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,430
Now, shoot!

189
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,090
Boss!

190
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,060
We got it!

191
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,880
Boss!

192
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,830
I can't believe that Boss got beat!

193
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,470
Fabre-san, there is no other way!

194
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,420
To save this island, we
should let them have Boss!

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,930
Make a decision! You're the mayor!

196
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,930
Yoko, I...

197
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,700
Dad, what should I do?!

198
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,310
To save this island...

199
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,260
Boss?

200
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,580
Boss?! Where are you going?!

201
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,200
Oh, you...

202
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,500
No, it's not like that, Boss!

203
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,230
No!

204
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,680
Boss!

205
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,100
Hey, Fabre! What is Boss doing?!

206
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,230
He heard everyone's inner voices and

207
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,190
he's trying to save this island
by sacrificing himself!

208
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,330
Boss!

209
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,270
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

210
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,500
You're covered with cuts and bruises.

211
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,860
Don't worry.

212
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,540
Stay still.

213
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,030
I'll fix you up.

214
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,170
Trust me.

215
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,520
No!

216
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,450
Saying goodbye is always hard to do.

217
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,940
I understand you, senorita!

218
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,780
That was too easy but it's okay.

219
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,370
Now, come in and make yourself at home!

220
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,880
With this beetle in our hands,

221
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,290
we can finally become members
of the Big Boss' crew!

222
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,210
Hey, you!

223
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,940
Wait!

224
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,920
I said "wait!"

225
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,410
Can't you hear what I'm saying!

226
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm not gonna let you go with...

227
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,060
...these bastards!

228
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,100
Giant Beetle! You still
haven't fought with me!

229
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,180
We promised and I know that you remember!

230
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,600
Pirate!

231
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,210
W-What're you doing?!

232
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,490
Can't you see that Boss was trying
to sacrifice himself for the island?

233
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,320
Shut up! I don't care!

234
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,490
I just wanna fight him!

235
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,660
Is that it?!

236
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,660
He's so hopeless!

237
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,480
Do you have something to say?!

238
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,540
I want to...

239
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,150
I want to...

240
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,930
...be with Boss forever!

241
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,640
Yoko!

242
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,980
I want to...

243
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,300
...be with Boss...

244
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,070
...on this island!

245
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,590
Hearing that makes me realize
something. Let me down!

246
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,420
You're completely right!

247
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,790
I'm sorry that I gave you a hard time, Yoko!

248
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,670
Before I thought that we
better let them have Boss...

249
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,960
...And I'm ashamed of myself!

250
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,340
We love Boss...

251
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
...As well as this island!

252
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,850
W-W-We won't let...

253
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,600
...People like you...

254
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,640
...Have him!

255
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,270
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

256
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:02,260
You people are really manipulated
by what that stupid kid said!

257
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,860
It's like a sappy drama! It makes me sick!

258
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,420
They choose to be exterminated.

259
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,970
Underdogs will always perish.
That's the way of the world.

260
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,280
Oh, that's...

261
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,090
Oh, he starts to shed his skin!

262
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,440
Awesome!

263
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,660
How funny! Now they're starting
to fight amongst themselves!

264
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,270
Boss!

265
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,740
Boss!

266
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,740
--Boss!
--Boss!

267
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,580
Oh no! It was too soon to
shed his skin as I thought!

268
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,820
I don't know about the structure of your body

269
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,170
but it seems like that was
an incomplete transformation.

270
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,130
You should be disappointed.
I feel sorry for you!

271
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,320
Crying or screaming won't help anymore!

272
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,590
We got your guardian angel as you see!

273
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,600
It's not over yet!

274
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,980
We won't let his last breath...

275
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,020
...be wasted.

276
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,810
Thank you, Giant Beetle!

277
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,990
Now, it's showtime!

278
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,310
To recover the beetle and
protect Little East Blue,

279
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,340
the islanders travel through
the caves according

280
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,510
to Nami's secret plan.

281
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,030
Meanwhile, Luffy pursues
Largo, but the power of the

282
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,850
Net-Net Fruit traps him inside Largo's body.

283
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

284
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,060
"A Special Presentation Related to the Movie!
Luffy vs. Largo The Battle is on!"

285
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,210
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
