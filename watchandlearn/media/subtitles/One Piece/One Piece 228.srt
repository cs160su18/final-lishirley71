00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,280
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,810
Ice Age...

24
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,410
I'm impressed that you survived as a child.

25
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,250
You betrayed people and ran away.
You gained people's favor and used them.

26
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,790
You've survived in the underworld
by being quick to switch sides.

27
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,250
So this is the group that you
chose as your next hideout, huh?

28
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,050
The organizations Nico Robin had
something to do with up until today

29
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,550
all got annihilated...

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,140
...except for her.

31
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
You've come across some good friends.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,700
But you're still you, Nico Robin!

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
No...! I'm no longer...

34
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,790
Robin!

35
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,210
I'm...

36
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,130
Robin-chan!

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:32,270
"Duel between Rubber and Ice! Luffy vs. Aokiji"

38
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,120
You bastard!

39
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,170
Don't yell... She'll still live
if you defrost her carefully.

40
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,880
But her body has become fragile, so be careful.

41
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,130
If her body is broken, she'll die.

42
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,260
For example...

43
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,010
What?!

44
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,390
if you smash it like this...

45
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,810
Robin!

46
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,520
No!

47
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,150
Stop it!!

48
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:27,950
Hm?

49
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,750
That was close...

50
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,550
--Good job!
--Amazing, Usopp!

51
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,800
What the hell...?

52
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,340
Usopp! Chopper!

53
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,100
Run to the ship! Treat Robin and save her!

54
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,980
G-Got it!

55
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,560
Hurry up...! But gently, okay?

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,730
--It's cold!
--You idiot! Think of how cold Robin is!

57
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,400
Don't bother...

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,450
It'd be better for the world
not to save that woman.

59
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,700
Not to split hairs, but a pirate group
is a collection of people like that.

60
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,420
You got that right, lady.

61
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,840
Get out of my way, would you?

62
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,920
Nami-san!

63
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,260
--We can't...
--...just let you...

64
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,920
Wait, you two!

65
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,390
Don't interfere. I wanna fight him in a duel.

66
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,520
Let's you and me...

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,150
...settle this fight!

68
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,950
That's fine...

69
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,530
...but since I don't have a ship to
take you back in, I'll kill you, okay?

70
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,040
She... can't breathe, can she?

71
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,330
I think she's probably in a
state of suspended animation.

72
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,880
Th-Then won't she die if we don't hurry up?

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,670
But if we warm her rapidly, her body will break.

74
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,800
We need to restore her body
temperature from the inside.

75
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,470
I-Is this really gonna work?

76
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,810
I don't know... but this is the only way...

77
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,390
You can't just say you don't know!
Robin's life depends on you!!

78
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,570
But I've never seen a human whose
entire body got frozen like this!

79
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,280
Sure, Aokiji said she was still alive,

80
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,110
but to me, it's surprising that she's still alive!

81
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,540
Don't whine! If you can't do anything,
then no one can save her!

82
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,000
You're the doctor on this ship!

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,790
I know that! Just shut your mouth for a while!

84
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,770
Chopper!

85
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,820
Ah... What?! Why?! Just the three of you?!

86
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,610
We'll explain it later!

87
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,360
We're gonna go back right away!

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,490
Do something about our frozen arm and leg!

89
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,330
Ahh, okay. Let's see...

90
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,700
We have to melt those frozen
areas with water immediately.

91
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,500
But we're using the shower
room for Robin right now.

92
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,330
Is she okay?!

93
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,290
It's too early to tell.

94
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,340
What?

95
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,010
So will this do?

96
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,050
Once you melt the ice at low temperature,

97
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,560
come up to the ship while
rubbing the affected parts!

98
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,730
Nami! Help us treat Robin!

99
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,480
Okay!

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,700
Why are you guys here?
Where's Luffy?! What about Aokiji?!

101
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,950
Luffy said he wanted a duel.

102
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,950
A duel?! And you guys left
Luffy there by himself?!

103
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,540
Those were the captain's orders.

104
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,080
Hey! Even if it was the captain's order,
you can't just do that!

105
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,670
Aren't you guys a little
too cold-hearted?! Luffy is...

106
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,010
Shut up!

107
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,630
It's a duel. Can't you understand?!

108
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,890
Stop it! This is no time for that!

109
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,270
We're... in a crisis right now.

110
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,060
Whether this decision is his
passing whim or whatever,

111
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,320
if anything should happen,
be prepared to respond to that!

112
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,040
As I thought, you're an odd one.

113
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,310
Gum-Gum...

114
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,770
...Storm!

115
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,160
Ice Time...

116
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,650
Let's you and me...

117
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,730
...settle this fight!

118
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,660
Darn... I was tricked.

119
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,370
Since I accepted the duel,
this fight ends when I win.

120
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,210
Now I see...

121
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,840
If I mess with the others now,
I'd be the senseless one here...

122
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,670
...right, Captain?

123
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,510
Or...

124
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,470
...did you seriously intend to defeat me?

125
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,650
Let me say this.

126
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,360
In the future, Nico Robin will grow...

127
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,360
That woman will definitely grow
to be too much for you to handle.

128
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,330
You guys will no longer be able to
shoulder the burden of the brutal fate

129
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,080
that Nico Robin was born into.

130
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,720
That's what it means...

131
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,840
...to let her on your ship...

132
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,680
...Monkey D. Luffy!

133
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:16,190
Breaking you right here, right now
and killing you would be very easy,

134
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,320
but we owe you one.

135
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,370
Now I want you to cancel our debt
to you for suppressing Crocodile.

136
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,750
Also...

137
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,580
Err... Well, I guess I don't have
to talk about that idiot Smoker.

138
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,670
See you around!

139
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,390
--There he is!
--Luffy!

140
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
He didn't get broken into pieces!

141
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,850
Good, good...

142
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,680
We'll carry him!

143
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,940
Let's hurry to the ship!

144
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,480
Don't talk at the same time!

145
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:08,700
According to this island's log,
their next destination is... Hm?

146
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,540
Water Seven... The city of water, huh?

147
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,880
Oh, my, my... They're really
getting closer to our Headquarters.

148
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,350
Oops, sorry about that.

149
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,960
Both of them...

150
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,050
Their hearts...

151
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,090
...started beating!

152
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,050
All right!

153
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,050
Luffy!

154
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,220
--Robin-chan!
--No! You can't go in yet!

155
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,850
You'll make a racket, right?

156
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,270
Hey, Dr. Chopper. I'll make something for them.

157
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,190
Y-You calling me "doctor" wouldn't
make me feel happy, you jerk!

158
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,610
Ah, when they wake up, some drinks
that can warm them up would be good.

159
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,400
I'll carry them to the lounge later.

160
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,700
Aye-aye, sir!

161
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Nami, are we gonna sail out?

162
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,120
No, we aren't, with our captain like that.

163
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,870
We've already got the log,
but let's stay here for today.

164
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:37,790
Hm?

165
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,380
What's the matter, Usopp?
Are you feeling drained?

166
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,470
I wonder if strong guys like him
are coming after us from now on...

167
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,980
All I did was get flustered.

168
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,270
Get some sleep, you idiot. You're exhausted.

169
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,220
In order for Luffy and Robin to get
some rest, the Going Merry anchored

170
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,890
off the uninhabited island for four days.

171
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,640
After that, we sailed out.

172
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,810
This is the third morning since
we started our voyage again.

173
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,530
It’s a fine day today, partly spring...

174
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,820
...with occasional bouts of summer.

175
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,330
What a beautiful day!

176
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,330
Nami-san!

177
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,130
I made potato paille. Mademoiselle, if you like...

178
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,260
Hmm, this is good!

179
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,850
I'm so happy!

180
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,310
Shut up, you jerk. You're disturbing my sleep!

181
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,060
Yeah, yeah, sorry about that, cactus head.

182
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,150
What'd you say, you dartboard jerk?!

183
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,810
Dar... What'd you just say, you bastard?!

184
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,110
Dartboard eyebrows.

185
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,450
Luffy! Yeah! Luffy! All right!

186
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,580
Luffy! Yeah! Luffy!

187
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,620
At last!

188
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,880
Luffy!

189
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,590
I'm impersonating my frozen self.

190
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,730
Geez... I can't believe he's doing that
after he got frozen and almost died.

191
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,240
--Did I do a good job?
--You did! You looked exactly like that, Luffy!

192
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,740
Clean that up good, okay, Luffy?!

193
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,700
Hm? What're you eating, Nami?

194
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,780
It's paille, a potato dish.

195
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,080
Potato, huh? I'm hungry, too. Hey, Sanji!

196
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,960
Just how much sleep do
you need to be satisfied?!

197
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,050
How much sleep I get is my business!
I'll take you on if you wanna fight!

198
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,460
Okay, stop right there!

199
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,800
Hey, Sanji-kun, our captain says
that he wants to eat paille.

200
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,890
Okay, Nami-san!

201
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,970
Sanji! Potatoes! Potatoes!

202
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,640
Even when you're recuperating,
you're the same old Luffy, aren't you?

203
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,400
They said this is called paille. Yummy!

204
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,780
What's paille?

205
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,780
It's the tail meat of a huge monster Paille.

206
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,120
I killed it. It was at least 100 meters high.

207
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,290
100 meters?! That's amazing, Usopp!

208
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,580
Hmm, a piece of cake. I did it before breakfast.

209
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,330
What? You got up early and killed it?

210
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,590
Chopper, say my name.

211
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,050
What? That's, of course, C-Captain...

212
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,510
That's right! My name is... Captain... Usopp!

213
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,440
Robin!

214
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,780
Yoo-hoo! Robin-chan!

215
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Robin!

216
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,740
How are you feeling? Do you feel a chill?

217
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,530
I'm feeling a lot better.
Thank you, my excellent doctor!

218
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,290
Oh... Being called an excellent doctor
wouldn't make me feel happy, you jerk.

219
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,000
--He sure does look happy.
--Yeah.

220
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,830
Take it easy, Robin.

221
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,380
You might feel uneasy when you
see Luffy being as good as new

222
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,420
after having the same experience as you,

223
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,340
but you can take your time and rest, you know.

224
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,220
--Yay!
--That wasn't a compliment!

225
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,430
Robin-chan! Shall I make
something that can warm you up?

226
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,600
Do you have an appetite?

227
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,520
Then... May I have some coffee?

228
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,360
Okay! It's my pleasure!

229
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,910
Hm?

230
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,710
What the hell is that?

231
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,550
Anyway, this paille thing is so good
that we can't stop eating, isn't it?

232
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,010
Yeah, it's yummy!

233
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,140
Hey, if we sell this thing, don't you
think we can make some money?

234
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,430
Hey, Luffy!

235
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,560
A-A frog is doing the front crawl!

236
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,730
What?!

237
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,770
It went to your side, so take a look at it!

238
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,400
--Is that true?
--A frog... Could it be that frog?

239
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,650
Hey, Luffy, are you taking what
that stupid Admiral said seriously?

240
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,570
To start with, there's no way a frog
would do the front cra... Hey, it is!

241
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,370
A-A frog is doing the front crawl!

242
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,290
--We'll follow it, guys!
--Yeah!

243
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,080
Furl the sail! Stand by the oars!
Turn the ship to 2 o'clock!

244
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
--Yeah!
--Hurry up!

245
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,340
I don't know why, but I feel
like we have to go after it!

246
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,130
Sorry to keep you waiting, mademoiselles.

247
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,890
What the...

248
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,760
What?! What happened?!

249
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,020
Seems like the ship changed course.

250
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,480
Hey, you guys! Why'd you change
the course without asking me?!

251
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,770
Hey, Nami, you've got to hear this!

252
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,440
We found a huge frog
with scars all over its body!

253
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,740
What the heck?

254
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,530
We're definitely gonna roast it whole and eat it!

255
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,530
You're gonna eat it?!

256
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,200
Hey, you're right...

257
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
Hm? Is that a lighthouse?

258
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,210
Why is there a lighthouse in a place
like that? I wonder if someone's there...

259
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,880
Wh-What's the matter? Do you see an island?

260
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,930
No, there's a lighthouse. A Log Pose
wouldn't point to that sort of place.

261
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,850
What about the frog? Tell us
the direction the frog went!

262
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,850
Not a chance!

263
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,680
The frog is headed to the lighthouse.

264
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,440
--What?
--To cook frogs, first remove
the slime using white wine,

265
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,520
and then dredge them in
flour and fry them crisp.

266
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,860
Hey, Sanji-kun!

267
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,360
If our captain says we're going,
what choice do we have but to go?

268
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,280
Robin...!

269
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,280
All right! Full speed ahead!

270
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,410
Yeah!

271
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,160
What's with the solidarity?!

272
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,040
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!...

273
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,170
It flew!

274
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,300
Don't let it get away! We'll move
ahead of it and block its course!

275
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,390
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

276
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,950
We ran ashore on something!

277
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,490
Ahh... Nami-san, Robin-chan, are you guys okay?

278
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,250
Yeah, somehow...

279
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,450
I'm okay.

280
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,420
Good... Hm?

281
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,210
What? What's this sound?

282
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
What? What's going on?

283
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,690
Is this...? Don't tell me...

284
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,120
Why... in a place like this...?!

285
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,500
Ow, ow, ow...

286
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,220
Go back! Go back! Turn 180 degrees!

287
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

288
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

289
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

290
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

291
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

292
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

293
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

294
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

295
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

296
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

297
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

298
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

299
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

300
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

301
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

302
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

303
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,080
Eternally... Eternally...

304
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,550
What the hell is that?!

305
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,010
A ship?! No, it's not!

306
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,920
Hey, it's coming this way!

307
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,880
--Amazing!
--It's not!

308
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,930
We'd better get out of here now!

309
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,720
Hey, that frog is headed towards it!

310
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,560
--Is he trying to collide with it?!
--Ahh! Wait! My meat!

311
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,930
That's not meat!

312
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,810
"The Dashing Sea Train and
the City of Water, Water Seven"

314
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
