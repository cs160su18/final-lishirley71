00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,390
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,920
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,630
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,420
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,680
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,920
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,380
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,660
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:08,670
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,340
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,850
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,320
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:41,030
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,800
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,340
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,510
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:03,550
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:19,410
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

20
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,610
The feelings of those who are in anguish

21
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,120
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,620
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,770
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

24
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,120
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

25
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,800
Crocodile tries to get information
on where the Poneglyph is

26
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,880
and announces that a cannonball
will be shot into the Palace Square.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,650
Will this be the end of Alabasta?

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,820
Or will there be real peace?

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,470
The sandglass of fate starts
the final countdown once again.

30
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,380
"The Battle Is Over!
Koza Raises The White Flag"

31
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,650
Out of our way!
Out of our way! Out of our way!

32
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,200
Oh, that's...!

33
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,250
Please wait, Chaka-sama!

34
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,010
Hmm...? Who are they?

35
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,550
You guys...

36
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,380
Kicking Claw Force!

37
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,020
"Alabasta Kingdom Elite Guard Unit
Kicking Claw Force"

38
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,770
Don't do it!

39
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,610
Stay away from this man!

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,930
They broke the door!
It's the Kicking Claw Force!

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,160
--Just as you'd expect from the elite troops!
--Please save His Majesty and Vivi-sama!

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,350
Your Majesty! Defending you
to the death is our mission!

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,960
We can't just stay away from him...

44
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,210
When dealing with one of
the Seven Warlords of the Sea...

45
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,170
...we have to do whatever
it takes, even if it's unfair.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,420
All four of us...

47
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,640
...will fight together...

48
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,470
...to set things right.

49
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,540
It seems that you are very popular...

50
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,650
I'll spare you, so go home.

51
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,320
--No can do.
--Hm?

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,150
There's a reason that we can't withdraw.

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,820
A reason?

54
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,430
If you really are the ringleader
of this whole rebellion...

55
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,830
Those bruises...!

56
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,630
Don't tell me you guys...!

57
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,930
Shall I...?

58
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,550
No, don't bother. They're worms.

59
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,560
They didn't...

60
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,770
Chaka! Something is wrong with them!

61
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,860
In order to boost their
power temporarily... they...

62
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,100
...they drank the water that
shortens their lives... the fatal fuel...

63
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,490
They only have a few minutes left to live...

64
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,140
They can't be saved...

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,400
Oh, no...

66
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,200
I thought as much...

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,790
Challenging me at the cost
of your own lives...?

68
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,190
Chaka-sama... Please forgive us
for doing this without consulting you.

69
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,970
However, we have to make him
realize... this country's pain...

70
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
You... idiots...

71
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,970
We have to make him...
realize this country's...

72
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,210
...anger!

73
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,530
That's not smart...

74
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,030
You should value your life.

75
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,380
Well, I guess it's too late, huh?

76
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,330
If you're gonna die anyway, I don't
even have to kill you myself, right?

77
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,210
So you don't even bother fighting...?!

78
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,890
Chaka... sama...

79
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,320
This is the very definition of stupidity.

80
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,580
You wicked fiend...!

81
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,600
You bastard!

82
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,920
Chaka!

83
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,550
Chaka! Stop it!
Don't follow them to their deaths!

84
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,300
I see... A Zoan type...

85
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,510
Dog Dog Fruit, Model Jackal!

86
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,310
Howling Fangs!

87
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,460
So you're the type...
who'd die for others, too?

88

"Alubarna - North Block
In front of the Mehdi Assembly Hall"

89
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,580
Dammit! I bled too much...

90
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,640
I guess I'm lucky that
the wounds aren't deep...

91
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,550
But it does... hit me hard...

92
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,280
I wonder how the others are...

93
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,600
No one'd better be dead...

94
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,000
I wanna know what's going on...

95
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,170
What?! I have to pair with Lashes?!

96
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,340
He's a camel, for god's sake!

97
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,100
Don't underestimate how weak I am!

98
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,910
It was because you were unlucky
in the raffle! Just give up!

99
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,180
All right, then! Then promise me one thing.

100
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,930
When we're in a pinch...!

101
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,530
Make sure you save us, please!

102
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,860
Dummy. I only save ladies.

103
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,800
Usopp...

104
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,260
Hey, Usopp. Why're you crying?

105
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,300
Who're you saying is crying?! Crying?!

106
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,570
The one who says someone's
crying is actually crying!

107
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,070
Uh, that makes no sense.

108
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,740
But...

109
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,190
That mole hag said... that Luffy's dead, so...

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,700
I... I wonder if it's true...

111
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,660
You guys believe that?

112
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,190
Of course not! Are you stupid or what?!

113
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,290
Me neither! I don't believe it at all!

114
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,150
All right already! Then what we have
to do now is get to the palace ASAP.

115
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,350
Stow your snot away until the
rumbling of this battle stops.

116
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't swallow it!

117
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,930
Everyone... thank you...

118
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,400
It's too early to thank us.

119
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,240
He's right. Besides, if you
wanna thank pirates...

120
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,120
...you have to let us see some goods...

121
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,370
Just what are you trying to
leach out of this country?!

122
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,720
Is Nami okay...? Did she get away okay...?

"Alubarna - North Block
Behind the Mehdi Assembly Hall"

124
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,790
Ahh... They finally came off...

125
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,760
So this is what he meant by
a powerful one-shot attack...

126
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,470
The wave of rebels is already
right around the corner...

127
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,810
...though the situation has changed....
In any case, I should head to the palace...

128
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,690
What's going on with Vivi...?
The battle seems to have started...

129
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,050
Oh yeah, Vivi-chan. Just remember this.

130
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,060
After a battle... that guy eats tons...

131
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Yes...

132
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,670
We'll be waiting for you in Alubarna, okay?!

133
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,050
Yeah!

134
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,310
Now, this will be the crucial point.

135
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,010
Don't goof things up!

136
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,160
Let's go! See you at the Alubarna Palace!

137
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,910
Chaka!

138
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,800
Being weak... is a crime...

139
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,630

K... Koza!

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,130
You... I see, you came through
the shortcut you used to use...

143
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,090
Is something wrong with my eyes...?

144
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,070
I came to persuade the Royal Army, but...

145
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,300
Chaka...

146
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,950
The king is... about to be
killed by the country's hero...

147
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,500
It's hard to believe what I'm seeing...!

148
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,860
This has become interesting!

149
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,900
You're in the middle of the battle right now,

150
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,540
and yet both sides' leaders
are facing each other here...

151
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,810
This war is now a fight to the death

152
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,510
between lizards whose heads are broken off.

153
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,410
Looks like you're confused.
Well, that's just a natural reaction...

154
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,770
...but it's simple.

155
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,900
Just imagine the worst possible scenario.

156
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,530
Don't hold suspicion, Koza.

157
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,940
Do you like this country?

158
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,880
Yeah! I was born here!

159
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,410
I'm the same way!

160
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,070
Koza, listen...

161
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,900
Vivi! Who took the rain
away from this country?!

162
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,150
Everything was...

163
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,250
It was me, Koza.

164
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,980
Everything you thought
was the king's doing

165
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,140
was a "trap" by my company.

166
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,840
Over the past two years, you guys
played right into our hands...

167
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,660
...when the royal family and army
were desperately chasing our shadows.

168
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,260
You probably could've died happy
if you didn't know this fact...

169
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,240
Don't listen to him, Koza!

170
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,570
King...

171
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,390
There's still things you can do!

172
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,540
Save as many citizens as you can!

173
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,460
Within less than half an hour...
the Palace Square will be blown up!

174
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,090
What?!

175
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,700
So you're still alive...

176
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,360
Hurry!

177
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,680
No!

178
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,040
Vivi...!

179
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,580
Hey! Move, Vivi! What're you doing?!

180
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,990
The Square will become a battlefield.
If it really gets blown up...

181
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,280
I won't... I won't let it become a battlefield!

182
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,780
You're still panicking!

183
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,310
What do you think will happen

184
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,960
if they realize now that
the Square'll be blown up?!

185
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,140
It won't just be a panic!

186
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,520
Once that happens, the war will
no longer stop! No one will be saved!

187
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,040
Isn't that right?

188
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,400
Well, well... what a clever judgment...

189
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,820
What we should do was
decided from the beginning...!

190
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,720
Which is to stop this plotted rebellion!

191
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,340
And you're the only one who can do it!

192
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,460
Vivi...

193
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,450
And you think I'll just sit back and watch?

194
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,050
Chaka!

195
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,540
I am... the Jackal, Alabasta's guardian deity!

196
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,780
The one who destroys the
enemies of the royal family!

197
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,360
As long as I still live, I fight!

198
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,980
That's what you call "stupidity."

199
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,600
Do as you want, both of you!

200
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,550
I can probably hold him back
at least for a few more minutes!

201
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,490
Okay!

202
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,310
Chaka...!

203
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,460
I guess the leader of
Sand Sand Clan isn't all that strong.

204
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,420
Now, what's the matter?

205
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,500
Ouch!

206
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,980
What's with you?! You're childish!
Take it easy on me!

207
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,660
You're a pain in the neck.

208
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,470
You're the one who asked me to train you.

209
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,620
Report from Guard Unit 2 to Headquarters!

210
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,140
Report from Unit 2 to Headquarters!

211
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,590
Line 4... has been broken through!

212
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,660
The rebel army is currently
passing through the Central Plaza

213
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,490
and heading to the North Block!
They'll reach the palace!

214
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,630
Raise the white flag to surrender!
Surrender right now...! Royal Army!

215
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,420
Vivi-sama! What's she saying?!

216
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,720
Surrender?!

217
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,120
If we do such a thing, what's
gonna happen to this country?!

218
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,580
Hey, look! That's...!

219
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,290
It's Koza! Why is the rebel army's leader here?

220
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:21,420
Listen to Vivi! We no longer
desire victory, or to fight!

221
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,100
I want you to stop this battle!

222
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,680
What?! What's going on?

223
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,400
I will let the rebel army know...
that this battle was pointless...

224
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,660
...that there's no longer
a reason for us to fight!

225
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,800
In order not to shed any more
pointless blood, wave the white flag!

226
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,300
Please!

227
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,000
The king's head is close at hand!

228
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,500
Ahh! We can now see the clock tower!

229
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,800
We're approaching the Palace Square!

230
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,100
Prepare to attack!

231
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,740
H-Hold it!

232
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:38,280
White flags?! The Royal Army is
waving white flags to surrender!

233
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,220
Koza-san!

234
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,040
I-It's Koza-san!

235
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,840
What is Koza-san doing here...?

236
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,180
Koza-san... What is Koza-san
doing here...? Why...?

237
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,140
The battle is over!

238
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,790
Everyone! Subdue your anger
and drop your weapon!

239
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,780
The Royal Army no longer
has the will to fight!

240
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,460
Please stop...!

241
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,690
Is that true...? Koza-san...?!

242
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,780
Yeah... the battle is now...

243
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,050
Koza!

244
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,740
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

245
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,740
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

246
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,960
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

247
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,420
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

248
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,640
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

249
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,100
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

250
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,850
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

251
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,610
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

252
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,860
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

253
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,880
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

254
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,870
A never-ending journey to be together

255
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,420
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

256
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,210
Wake up, Princess. You can't save the country.

257
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,540
My voice no longer reaches anyone...

258
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,320
If nothing is done, the country will...

259
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,890
Don't worry! Your voice is heard by us.

260
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,680
Luffy-san!

261
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,100
I'm gonna put an end... to all this!

262
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,830
On the next episode of One Piece!

263
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,000
"Where Vivi's Voice Gets Heard!
The Hero Descends!"

264
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,310
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
