00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,890
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,780
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,390
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,420
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,740
Chopper! What's wrong?!

35
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,060
Take a good look at me! It's me! I'm Nami!

36
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,250
Chopper!

37
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,410
Chopper! Stop it!

38
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,510
I'm gonna hurry up and finish it here.

39
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,390
Tempest Kick!

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,560
This is bad! Even the soles
are slippery. I can't dodge it!

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,510
Huh?! I could dodge it!

42
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,130
Ah... My right leg went back to normal.

43
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,490
Why? What caused it?

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,680
It's wet...

45
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,410
It got wet in the earlier
commotion. Oh, that's right!

46
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,210
Water! I can wash off
the soap power with water!

47
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,180
Aren't you being too optimistic?

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,170
Even if you figured out
how to undo Golden Bubbles,

49
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,270
there's no way I'd let you do that.

50
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,730
Sheep Cloud! Relaxing Bubbles!

51
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,990
I'll blow away those bubbles with wind!

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,590
Cyclone...

53
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,840
Shoot!

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,460
O... Oh, no... My strength is...

55
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,040
Supple Finger Pistol!

56
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,130
Takt...

57
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,950
Whip!

58
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,080
That was helpful.

59
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,230
Helpful?

60
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,480
If you blow me away like that,

61
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,740
the annoying bubbles on
my body get blown away, too.

62
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,210
That's a bluff. If you so wish, I'll keep
blowing you away until you die.

63
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,020
The weather forecast is cloudy!

64
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,730
Cloudy Tempo!

65
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,350
This is different from the
magic show stuff I used to do!

66
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,950
Clouds? More lightning?

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,040
Thunder doesn't get generated
from such thin clouds.

68
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,940
Instead, they'll condense!

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,670
Don't tell me...! No, she might do that!

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,280
The weather forecast is rain!

71
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,410
Cool Ball!

72
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,080
Shave!

73
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,360
Pour down! Rain Tempo!

74
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,300
You're not sweet at all. After I was nice
enough to make your skin silky smooth.

75
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,630
If being sweet means not
putting up a fight, then I'll pass.

76
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,340
Cool Charge!

77
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,950
What?

78
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,790
Mirage Tempo!

79
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,860
She disappeared?!

80
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,570
Now I understand... your powers...

81
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,240
...as well as the strength of CP9.

82
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,280
What's this?!

83
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,540
Mirage Tempo!

84
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,630
Fata Morgana!

85
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,150
"Nami's Decision!
Fire at the Out-of-Control Chopper!"

86
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,420
The mirage from earlier...

87
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,440
In the end, you've only got one body.

88
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,150
That's right. One of them is the real me.

89
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,900
The other four are illusions
being reflected by the chilly air.

90
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,890
Illusions, you say?

91
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,410
That sounds mysterious and lovely.

92
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,120
But when you think about it calmly,

93
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,790
it becomes obvious that illusions
don't have offensive power.

94
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,750
In other words, this is just an empty threat.

95
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,960
That's right.

96
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,050
So you turn defiant? You're not sweet.

97
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,130
Thunder Charge!

98
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,970
Only one of the five of me is real.

99
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,970
So what?

100
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,270
And... Thunder Ball!

101
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,480
Only 20% of my attacks are real as well.
Why don't you try dodging them?

102
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,730
Oh, shoot! I have to guard myself!
Which ones are the real ones?!

103
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,590
Its power, on the other hand, is 100%.

104
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,160
I told you... that I'd throw
you off your guard, didn't I?

105
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,390
This is very different from the old Clima Takt.

106
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,930
A mere Thunder Ball attack
has this much power.

107
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,390
With my next powerful attack, you'll fall.

108
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,350
What kind of prediction is that? How cocky...

109
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,060
It's not a prediction. It's a forecast.

110
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,530
I've controlled both humidity and temperature.

111
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,900
The weather in this room belongs to me!

112
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,850
What's the big deal with
controlling the weather?

113
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,240
The Six Powers are techniques
that exceed human abilities.

114
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,580
How insolent!

115
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,910
That wasn't the real one!

116
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,620
The possibility of catching
the real one today is again 20%.

117
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,390
According to today's sky forecast,
although atmospheric pressure is stable,

118
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,110
small dark clouds with violent
air currents will remain stationary

119
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,770
for a while, and soon they will shoot
thunderbolts through your chest.

120
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,770
Please watch out for paralysis of the heart!

121
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,980
Dark Cloud Tempo!

122
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,940
If this is lightning, I showed you at
the beginning that I can guard myself.

123
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,150
As long as I'm being careful...

124
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,250
The flaw in that technique is that
you can't move around while using it.

125
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,270
You sure take me lightly. Are you
telling me to break it with an attack?!

126
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,130
Then... Soap Sheep!

127
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,610
I don't have to know which one is the real one.

128
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,220
I'll swallow everything with a
big wave of Relaxing Bubbles.

129
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,390
Sheep Cloud!

130
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,270
Tidal Wave!

131
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,030
I'll be a goner if I get hit by that.

132
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,350
The one on the floor after I
swallow everything is the real one.

133
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,450
That's not gonna happen!

134
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,160
Cyclone Tempo!

135
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,160
She used wind to blow the bubbles away!

136
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,500
But it looks like the one who got
through it is the real one, huh?

137
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,980
Finger Pistol!

138
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,240
Oh? I thought it was another illusion.

139
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,020
I won't let you run around anymore.

140
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,950
I'll just turn your body into Swiss cheese.

141
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,920
You've already forgotten it, haven't you?

142
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,840
You should pay attention to the
weather forecast by a navigator.

143
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,610
From the dark clouds to the Clima Takt...

144
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,560
...a thunderbolt will burst forth...!

145
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,320
Come on!

146
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,820
The one from earlier...!

147
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,910
Thunder Lance Tempo!

148
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,050
No matter how strong you are...

149
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,760
...my forecast is never wrong.

150
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,600
My friends are waiting. I'll be taking your key.

151
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,920
That son of a bitch... Damn deer-gorilla!

152
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,100
This entire island is a mess!

153
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,060
They all had better be okay.

154
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,990
Hey, Navy! Come back!

155
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,950
Take us with you!

156
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,170
Tempest Kick!

157
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,290
Sky Slicer!

158
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,170
Chopper! What's taking you so long?!

159
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
What do you think you're doing?!

160
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,040
Hold it, Nico Robin!

161
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,940
Coo coo!

162
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,450
All right!

163
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,830
Coo coo!

164
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,650
Deer-gorilla! Where'd you go?!

165
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,810
What? Franky! What are you doing there?!

166
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,710
Oh, hey, lady.

167
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,910
That monster deer-gorilla in
your group came here, didn't he?

168
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,010
Deer... You mean Chopper?

169
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,930
Yeah, that deer-gorilla.

170
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,220
Yeah, he did. What's the deal?
What happened to him?

171
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,390
How should I know?! I wanna
ask that question myself!

172
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,720
He isn't someone who can
transform into something like that?

173
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,110
How would I know?!
I've never seen him in that form.

174
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,700
I see... I thought you guys
might know how to deal with that.

175
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,160
Then, I guess I'll just kill him anyhow.

176
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,580
If you say that again, I'm gonna kill you.

177
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,330
I-I'll never say it again. Ever again.

178
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,050
But we still need to do something.

179
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,920
If he rampages about while he's that huge,

180
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,110
you never know how long this tower will last.

181
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,980
Yeah. He isn't in a state
where he'll listen to us.

182
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,940
It seemed like he didn't recognize me,
so I think he's lost his memory.

183
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,770
What's causing it?

184
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm not totally sure,

185
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,000
but it may have something to
do with his Devil Fruit powers.

186
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,320
Then there's only one way
to solve this problem...

187
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,850
By the way, you're not bad at all.
You took this woman down?

188
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,260
Her key is important. The #2 key is.

189
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,500
Key... Hold on a sec. I was searching for it.

190
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,010
Key! Key! Where'd you hide it?

191
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,220
Yow! Nice scandalous action!

192
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,240
Ahh! Stay back! Stay back!

193
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,420
Listen, you guys! To tell you
the truth, 8,000 men are under m...

194
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,860
I mean, under my close friend Usopp-kun!

195
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,730
S-So, this island is already surrounded.

196
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,320
Stop the useless resistance and surrender!

197
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,930
Eight thousand guys? It'll be
worthwhile killing all of them, huh?

198
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,990
Hurry up and call them in here.

199
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,710
Don't be a fool. He's clearly lying.

200
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,650
To think that you easily fell
for such an obvious lie...

201
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,490
You're a disgrace to CP9.

202
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,590
Who's the fool here? I knew it was a lie;
I was just making fun of him.

203
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,800
I can't stand how ridiculously honest
and incredibly serious you are.

204
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,500
What's wrong with being serious and honest?

205
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,180
I'm saying the "ridiculously" and
"incredibly" parts are bad, blockhead!

206
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,930
My plan worked. Yay...

207
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,130
But now...

208
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,530
The Buster Call is imminent, so...

209
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,490
Eek!

210
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,520
We've wasted too much time, but...

211
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,450
Let's both get serious and...

212
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,320
Huh?

213
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,360
--...settle this, shall we?
--...settle this, huh?

214
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,110
What?! H-Hey, hold on a sec. Calm down!

215
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,080
We're calm!

216
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,750
Tempest Kick!

217
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,620
Oh, shoot!

218
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,630
--Pick it up!
--Okay!

219
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,140
Finger Pistol--!

220
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,840
Finger Pistol!

221
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,360
Looks like playtime is over.
Don't let your guard down.

222
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,560
Oh no...

223
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,850
Shave!

224
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,010
Ow, ow, ow...

225
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,280
This is bad. They're pretty fired up.

226
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,330
We'd better hurry up and take these off.

227
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,990
Chopper! Hurry up!

228
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,320
What the hell is this monster?!

229
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,810
There was another Zoan type power holder?!

230
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,300
Does that mean that this
guy's also part of CP9?!

231
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,460
Come to think of it, I feel
like I've seen him before.

232
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,130
Ch-Chopper?!

233
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,930
What're you doing, Chopper?! It's us!

234
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,680
Ahh! Stop it!

235
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,610
Hey, is that really Chopper?!
How come he doesn't recognize us?!

236
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,990
I don't know, but it must be Chopper!
Who else has those antlers and wears that hat?!

237
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,710
Then, what about our hope and the #2 key?!

238
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,080
Who knows? This is it! We're gonna die.

239
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,410
But something is wrong.

240
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,870
Isn't he the one who looks
like he is about to die?

241
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,170
It seems as if his vitality is rapidly dimming.

242
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,080
Wh-Wh-What does that mean?

243
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,510
It may be that him staying in that form
uses up too much energy or something.

244
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,360
What the hell?! What do we do
about him and the other two?!

245
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,700
Hey, what's gonna happen
to the key? The #2 key?!

246
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,550
I don't know what happened,

247
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,090
but he must've fought incredibly hard...

248
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,110
So hard that he transformed into that.

249
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,860
#2...

250
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,070
We got interrupted. What's that monster?

251
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,500
When the Buster Call is imminent...

252
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,790
Of course he'd interrupt us.
It seems like he's one of those pirates.

253
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,290
Anything that gets in our way...

254
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,830
...should be eliminated.

255
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,370
Although this is a small fry...

256
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,140
...we've got another prey now.

257
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,720
Dammit! They're gonna attack Chopper!

258
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,400
Straighten your back,
renowned sword Nose Storm.

259
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,850
H-Hey! What're you gonna do?!

260
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,360
Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

261
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,150
You bastard!

262
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,530
Step aside, you guys!

263
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,360
--Huh?
--That guy...!

264
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,780
Franky! What're you trying to do?!

265
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,990
This is one of our...

266
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,040
I know! Just be quiet.

267
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,920
This is the only way that I
can think of to deal with him.

268
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,040
Power holders have a weakness...

269
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll push him off to the sea.

270
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,510
I'll go easy, so bear with me!

271
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,680
Coup de...

272
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,810
...Vent!

273
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,060
You bastard, Franky! That's reckless!

274
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,400
What're you doing to our friend?!

275
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,450
Don't worry. He discussed
this with me beforehand.

276
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,370
What?

277
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,510
What're they doing, attacking their own?

278
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,180
They sure do make a big fuss.

279
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,730
So you're finally released?

280
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,110
You'd better stop laughing
and start regretting.

281
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,570
Never again...

282
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,110
...will you get a chance like
you had earlier to slay me...

283
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,380
...World Government!

284
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,570
Why don't you run around like you
did earlier, you stupid masked man?!

285
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,510
Please! Don't kill Usopp!

286
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,350
You fool! You'll die next!

287
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,410
Now, this is it for you!

288
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,490
Don't!

289
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,020
--No way...
--Who the hell are you?!

290
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,180
On the next episode of One Piece!

291
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,860
"Hunter Sanji Makes an Entrance?
Elegy for a Lying Wolf"

292
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
