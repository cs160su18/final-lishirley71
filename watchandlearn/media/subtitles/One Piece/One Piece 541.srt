00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,660
Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660
Make waves, jump from your sleep

your toughness, that’s what it takes

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,880
Being brazen, is it a crime?

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830
It’s important not to wake up

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,850
We won’t left anyone behind

55

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
One, two, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,050
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,520
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,150
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,160
where the New Fish-Man Pirates - who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,370
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after Shirahoshi,
are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,660
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,380
Meeting Jimbei again at the Sea Forest,

81
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,670
Luffy learns about the
Fish-Man Island along with

82
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,050
Nami, Sanji, Chopper,
Franky and the others.

83
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:17,310
"Kizaru Appears!
A Trap to Catch Tiger!"

84
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,360
Fisher Tiger's attack on
the Holyland of Marie Jois

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,030
and the Sun Pirates' raid - those events...

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,580
...had such impact on Fish-Men's future.

87
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,840
15 YEARS AGO

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,270
I can't believe that he really did it.

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,480
It put the Fish-Man Island
in a bad position again.

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,280
We won't be welcomed at the
World Summit for a while.

91
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,030
Now, what should we do?

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,250
But we couldn't stop him that day.

93
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,790
What did you see during your trip?

94
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,050
I saw humans!

95
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,720
Because I could hear that the
scream from his soul so loudly.

96
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

97
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,990
He showed up the Celestial Dragons
who no one dares challenge!

98
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,240
Fisher Tiger - the hero
of the Fish-Man Island!

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,540
Wow! A Fish-Man changed history!

100
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,370
Listen to me, everyone!

101
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,000
--Oh, that's Queen Otohime!
--Her again?

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,630
We have been cowering, hiding and running.

103
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,140
But we have learned nothing from it.

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,520
If we cut all humans off because of
the actions of only a few bad ones,

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,100
there will be no future for the Fish-Men!

106
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,560
Now, let's live together with humans!

107
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,070
Learn about them under the bright sun!

108
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,030
--Learn about them?
--Yeah, I feel sorry for her but...

109
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,030
You two right there!

110
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,160
Sign here!

111
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,000
I-I can't, Otohime-sama!

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,710
The whole island is applauding
Tiger-san for what he did.

113
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,590
It might cause a rift
between us and the humans.

114
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,050
But, after all, it's their fault,
of course. So I can't...

115
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,560
Even though it's impossible now,
think about 7 years or 11 years or 15 years from now.

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Plan for the day that we will be able to
participate in the World Summit again.

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,110
Please! Sign here! Please!

118
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,900
How great! Fisher Tiger!

119
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,410
THE FISH-MAN DISTRICT

120
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,410
He was leader in this town!

121
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,910
He made the Celestial Dragons mad!

122
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,910
HORDY JONES

123
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,910
The Celestial Dragons!

124
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,040
He sure showed those annoying humans!

125
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,670
Arlong-san always said
that humans were all jerks!

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,460
They're lowly creatures!

127
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,510
The Sun Pirates are pummeling humans
as they sail around the sea now-dosun!

128
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,510
Cool-dosun!

129
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,850
If we were stronger,
we could've gone with them-ch!

130
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,940
Awesome! It's so cool!
I wanna do it too, someday!

131
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,360
Go, Sun Pirates! Kill all the humans!

132
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,610
Yeah!

133
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,620
Boss! Boss! There's an enemy ship-nyu!

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,660
Boss! Boss! Boss!

135
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,580
Boss Tai! We have a crisis!

136
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,670
Shut up, Hachi!

137
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,170
Why don't you calm down a bit?

138
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,300
How disturbing. Is it the Navy?

139
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,470
Nyu! I saw the Navy's banner!

140
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,970
What should we do, Boss?

141
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,190
That's a silly question!

142
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,230
There is no mistake!
Those are the Sun Pirates!

143
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,900
Kill Tiger!

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
You missed!

145
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,910
Shoot them!

146
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,050
What are you doing?! Shoot at them!

147
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,920
But it's hard when they're in the water!

148
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,950
Oh no.

149
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,080
You Fish-Man bastards!
Return all the slaves!

150
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,250
Then the charges against you will...

151
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,500
R-Rear Admiral-dono!
Th-They're coming from below...

152
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,960
What?!

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,970
You fools!

154
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,980
Just give us back the slaves.
What you guys are doing is a serious crime!

155
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,810
How dare you turn against humans!
You guys are only Fish-Men!

156
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,940
What did you say?

157
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,230
Let's hear...

158
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,280
Let's hear you say that again!

159
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,870
Help...

160
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,830
Slavery is okay but
freeing slaves is a crime?

161
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,710
And you still want us to give
humans a chance, Queen Otohime?

162
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,650
Shoot! Shoot!

163
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,440
Shoot at him! We got a tip!

164
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,910
You guys are hiding the former slaves!

165
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:44,990
No way!

166
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,250
The former slaves?

167
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,540
A-Are you a monster?!

168
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,640
Do you have any proof that
we are hiding the slaves?

169
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,940
Check all of us. I heard all the
slaves have a mark on their body.

170
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,440
Do you see it?!

171
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,310
L-Let go of me! Stop! What are you doing?!

172
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,860
Help me!

173
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,910
Don't worry, I'll let you go.
I'm not like you humans.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,710
Guys! Take their money,
goods and food, and get back to the ship!

175
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,170
You deserve execution.

176
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,050
Being human is itself a sin.

177
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Wait, Arlong!

178
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,510
Drop dead!

179
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,560
Vice Admiral Borsalino.

180
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,020
MARINEFORD--THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS

181
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,020
G2 branch - Rear Admiral Kadar's
ship has been defeated.

182
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,990
Oh? Why did they even fight them?

183
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,370
I just wanted to know where they were.

184
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,990
It's said if you get
close enough to see them,

185
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,620
they'll surround you in the
water before you know it.

186
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,920
Oh, that's scary! They aren't known as
undersea professionals for nothing.

187
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,880
So, what are we up against?

188
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,180
Well, it looks like Arlong and his men,

189
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,310
who are conducting raids around
the Fish-Man island, are among them.

190
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,190
But they're always in water so it's
hard to tell how strong they are.

191
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,320
Arlong... Yes, I've heard about him before.

192
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,280
And they said there is a man

193
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,820
who is as big as Tiger and just as
formidable but we don't even know his name.

194
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,080
Oh, that's not good.

195
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,950
Ouch!

196
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,800
So what? It's not so big a deal to get rid
of one or two of those lowly creatures!

197
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,720
You two are going too far, don't you think?

198
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,180
We're not a group of killers.
Stop acting like fools!

199
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:17,810
But Brother Tai - I mean, "Boss!"
They're all trying to kill you!

200
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,190
If that's what they want, we might
go a little too far! It makes us mad!

201
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,280
If you kill somebody, it's your loss!
Do you want to be like them?

202
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,750
This is not revenge for their discrimination.
Neither was what I did at Marie Jois.

203
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,840
I broke that stupid unspoken rule but I did
so to free all those mistreated slaves.

204
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,880
We Sun Pirates are all about liberation
and freedom. There is nothing more to it.

205
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,760
If we start to seek revenge
against the humans as we like,

206
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,640
it will only lead them to get back
at us later and that's just tragic.

207
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,520
They will look on innocent
future Fish-Men as their enemies.

208
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,650
Don't you see?

209
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,740
We'll fight and rob those people who
come after us but don't cross the line.

210
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,910
We won't kill anyone!

211
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,170
Big Brother! I always wanted
to say one thing to you.

212
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,750
"It will only lead them to get back at us"?

213
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,170
We could just kill them so
they can't get back at us.

214
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,010
Kill them brutally and
scare the hell out of them!

215
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,890
Then they wouldn't dare
think about getting revenge!

216
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,850
They don't know how strong
and dreadful we can be!

217
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,770
Let it be engraved in
their minds! The terror!

218
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,530
What do you think you're doing?!

219
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,360
Is that Jimbei?

220
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,580
Arlong is very hot-blooded and
quite a pain in the neck, isn't he?

221
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,460
I don't blame him.

222
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,340
In fact, I have no right to say such a thing.

223
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,340
Brother Tai...

224
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,180
Jimbei, what Queen Otohime
is calling for is great.

225
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,560
For her, there is no difference
between Arlong and me.

226
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,790
What I'm most afraid of is the demon
that is hiding deep in my mind.

227
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,010
At that time, I couldn't
understand what Boss really meant.

228
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,850
Nyu! There's a pirate ship!

229
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,390
It's a big one!

230
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,560
They wanna beat us to prove themselves!

231
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,020
Now we have these kinds of enemies, too.

232
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,270
Well, if we sink them,
we'll make an example of them!

233
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,450
We were fighting on a daily basis,
as criminals wanted by the Government

234
00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:00,580
while Queen Otohime was fighting
against the world in her own way, too.

235
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,750
Sign here!

236
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,830
No, Your Majesty! We don't wanna
live together with humans!

237
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,790
Please!

238
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,210
Hey, they put a bounty on
Boss Tai and Jimbei-san!

239
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,010
What?!

240
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,720
Wow, 230 million berries!

241
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,890
Jimbei-san is 76 million berries!

242
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,350
Wanted posters!
The reward has increased again!

243
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,190
Even the World Government is scared!

244
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,150
Destroy the Navy!

245
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,570
Sign!

246
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,240
Let go of me!

247
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,700
So 3 years passed like that and then
we met a young girl on some island.

248
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,000
Mister, could you do us a favor?

249
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,870
12 YEARS AGO

250
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:54,010
This girl escaped from Marie Jois like
us 3 years ago when you freed the slaves.

251
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,960
Look.

252
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,520
But her hometown where her
parents are is far from here.

253
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,270
We wanna take her home but we don't
think we can cross the ocean safely.

254
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,070
My name is Koala. I'm 11 years old.

255
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,900
Thank you for helping me 3 years ago.

256
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,490
She might be a kid but she's
still a human! Disgusting!

257
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,910
Why did you invite a human on board?!

258
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,330
It's just how things turn out.

259
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,210
Stop smiling! You're an aggravating brat!

260
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,670
Arlong-san!

261
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,800
Arlong-san!

262
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,380
Let go of me, Hachi! I
wanna pound her into pulp!

263
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,720
He's right.
She's constantly smiling and kind of creepy.

264
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,570
What are you...?

265
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm sorry! I'll work! I'll clean without
taking a break! So please don't hit me!

266
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,070
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

267
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,530
I'm sorry!

268
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,580
--What are you doing?
--I'm sorry!

269
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,870
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

270
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,920
--Hey, you're bleeding.
--I'm sorry!

271
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,170
I'll never ever cry -
just please don't kill me!

272
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,180
Hey, stop it! Are you afraid of us?

273
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,810
Yes, I am. But I wanted to see my mother so
I plucked up courage and got on board.

274
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,940
If I stop cleaning,
maybe you men are gonna kill me.

275
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,190
I'll serve you well so please don't kill me!

276
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,160
She's used to living as a slave.

277
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:52,080
She must have seen other slaves get killed
when they cried or took a break from cleaning.

278
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,840
So she has always been afraid that she
might be next and she can't trust anyone.

279
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,010
Boss!

280
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,770
Please! Don't kill me! I'll do anything!

281
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,610
Bring this brat to my room.

282
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,530
What is he doing?

283
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:25,070
Lecturing her won't do anything.
She's mentally ill.

284
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,370
Boss! What're you doing in there?!

285
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,180
Stop the bleeding!

286
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,060
I may have been rough on her but she couldn't
forget being a slave with that mark on her.

287
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,890
Hey, are you alive?!

288
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,980
Oh, you're up!

289
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,230
Oh, I passed out.

290
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,070
I'm sorry! But I didn't cry
so please don't kill me!

291
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,290
I'll never, ever cry so please don't kill me!

292
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,790
It's okay to cry!

293
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,550
Don't think that we're like
those stupid Celestial Dragons!

294
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,260
Look closely.

295
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,330
What?

296
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,720
We won't kill anybody!

297
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
Let's go, guys!

298
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,650
We'll take her...

299
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,950
...to her hometown!

300
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,500
The Straw Hats and Toriko's friends
have the crossover of your dreams!

301
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,670
Chopper has come down with Deap Sea Fever,

302
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,550
so Luffy and Toriko's groups must find
a mysterious ingredient to save him.

303
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,560
But Chopper will only last until daybreak!

304
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,890
As the seconds tick by, mighty
beasts rise up to block their way!

305
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

306
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,980
"A Team is Formed! Save Chopper"

307
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
