2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,990
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,750
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,190
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,360
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,350
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,850
We're gonna make you rue the
day you picked a fight with us!

48
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,190
Gecko Moria, we're taking back
twice the amount of food you stole!

49
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,570
And before dawn!

50
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,780
Yeah!

51
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,530
This spells trouble! I need to
hurry and inform the master.

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,620
What?!

53
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,290
The people we stole shadows from
couldn't possibly be awake!

54
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,710
I-It looks like their friends
whacked them awake!

55
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,580
Come to think of it,
where the heck is Absalom?!

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,080
Uh, about that...

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,920
His wedding ceremony is about to start...

58
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,230
The majority of the General Zombies
are attending his wedding.

59
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,490
This incident doesn't call for that beast.

60
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,480
What?

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,090
I'm going back to my room.

62
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,630
Come on, Kumacy.

63
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,320
Okay! I'm coming.

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,060
I'm going to stay here for a while.

65
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,740
I want to play with Oars.

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,080
Then I have a favor to ask of you.

67
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,050
Where is Moria?!

68
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,590
Stay away!

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,380
Give my food back!

70
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,010
Huh?

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,480
We're falling!

72
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,440
Usopp! Sanji!

73
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,360
The whole lot of them fell
when the stairs gave out.

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,470
Forget about those two
who came hurtling down.

75
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,450
What the hell is that?

76
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,380
It came out of nowhere
and it's blocking our path!

77
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,750
What is this wall?!

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,220
This isn't made out of stone...

79
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,890
No! What the heck are you two doing?!

80
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,720
That is Luffy's zombie!

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,650
"Usopp's the Strongest?
Leave Anything Negative to Him!"

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,570
"Moria's Dance Hall"
"Perona's Room"

83
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,930
Usopp and Sanji fell downstairs.
Aren't we going after them?

84
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,210
Nah! Those two should be fine!

85
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,590
We need to make our way to Moria

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,050
and pluck that giant shallot
before it gets up and moves!

87
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,890
Got it! That's the quickest way
to solve all of our problems.

88
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,270
That entrance leads to the dance hall
where he stole your shadow, Luffy!

89
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,150
Beyond there is a giant freezer.

90
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,860
That's the last place we saw Moria!

91
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,570
All right!

92
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,790
Didn't Perona take you down?!

93
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,090
Hogback...!

94
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,460
Who is that reindeer?

95
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,180
So that is Dr. Hogback...

96
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,700
He was with Moria!

97
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,000
May I give him a sound beating?

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,350
H-Hold your horses!

99
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,940
Wait, Luffy.

100
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,970
Could you leave him to me?

101
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,240
See that doorway in the back?

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,610
It leads to the freezer. Go on ahead!

103
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,950
Okay, you got it!

104
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,060
You can't skip straight to Moria-sama!
Learn some manners!

105
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,210
Cindry-chan, get him!

106
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,830
Certainly.

107
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,540
One!

108
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,170
Two!

109
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,050
What was that? A plate?

110
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,300
Looking good, Cindry-chan!

111
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,430
I won't miss again.

112
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,970
Three!

113
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,230
What's the matter, Cindry-chan?

114
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,780
What's that?!

115
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,490
Feel free to go ahead, Luffy.

116
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,410
'Kay! Thanks, Robin!

117
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,950
Wait, dammit! Straw Hat!

118
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,990
Hogback!

119
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,420
You've disappointed me!
I refuse to consider you a doctor!

120
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,340
I didn't recognize you, Dr. Chopper!

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,720
You were a Zoan type power holder?

122
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,100
No wonder I thought you were
such a peculiar creature...

123
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,360
I don't know how you escaped
on your way to Perona's garden,

124
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,180
but that won't happen again
now that I've run into you!

125
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,900
I will get your shadow!

126
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,990
Nah. How about I kill you
and use your body as a mario?

127
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,370
They'll do the dirty work!

128
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,300
That penguin...!

129
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,760
Sanji's shadow is inside of it!

130
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,940
Huh? Then what about the other one?

131
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,890
That's right! If the zombies act just like us,

132
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,170
then I saw your zombie, Zoro.

133
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,660
What was he like?

134
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,280
No different from you.

135
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,960
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame!

136
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,500
They aren't anything alike!

137
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,250
Indeed not.

138
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,110
Go! Wipe the floor with them!

139
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,510
Okay, Hogback-sama.

140
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,640
Who should we take out first?

141
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,140
That damn reindeer.

142
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,990
This hallway is surprisingly long!

143
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,800
Sweet! I finally reached the end!

144
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,300
Now where am I?

145
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,140
Found ya!

146
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,390
Hey! If it isn't you.

147
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,330
Wh-What...?

148
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,500
Wh-Why is he so freakishly big?!

149
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,590
What is he, some demon lord?!
I've never seen a giant this big before!

150
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,800
Isn't he a zombie?

151
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,970
This is...

152
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,350
Luffy's...?

153
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,970
Crap! We're doomed!

154
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,600
He's here to kill us!

155
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,900
Eek! Gulp!

156
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,260
What's he gonna do now?!

157
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,100
No!

158
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,980
I like this!

159
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,130
Sweet! Now I feel the part!

160
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,390
I'm gonna become the
rottin' King of the Pirates!

161
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,490
Man, I totally freaked out
when the building collapsed.

162
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,730
Wh-What gives?

163
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,020
Didn't he notice us?

164
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,280
He really sounded just like Luffy.

165
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,030
That body with Luffy's fighting
abilities might be a problem!

166
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,390
Why don't we give up on your shadows?

167
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,530
No way!

168
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,460
Even if you convinced me to,

169
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,760
I'd still want to save Nami-san!

170
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,520
Pull yourself together!

171
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,770
The lack of stairs is going to be a problem.

172
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,650
It looks like Usopp and I got knocked
down along with the entire stairway.

173
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,150
Even if we switched to this path,
the bridge here is also toast.

174
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,030
All of the paths leading to the mansion
by the mast have been cut off.

175
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,820
And none of us could make that jump.

176
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,900
There goes our shortcut...

177
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,700
There'll be gobs of zombies
along the long way...

178
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,170
Just give me thirty seconds!

179
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,180
Something about this design
doesn't seem right...

180
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,930
You built a bridge!

181
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,130
I could make a bridge or two easy with
all this wood and debris everywhere!

182
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,570
But didn't you go a bit overboard with
the details for a makeshift bridge...?

183
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,360
Are you telling me to do a half-assed job?

184
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,580
Hardly! This was a huge help!

185
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,320
Anyway, you were a lifesaver! Now, let's go!

186
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,800
What's with this room?

187
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,900
Isn't this room rather ostentatious?

188
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,880
I had planned on sacrificing you to the
zombies on the stairs and the bridge.

189
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,090
I never expected Oars to come crashing down.

190
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,760
He just had to interfere!

191
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,620
Those ghosts...!

192
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,080
I never would have suspected
that she was controlling them.

193
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,790
What the heck are they?!

194
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,840
You already know just how
terrifying these ghosts can be!

195
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,890
Having eaten the Hollow-Hollow Fruit,

196
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,030
I am an incorporeal human
capable of creating ghosts at will.

197
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,320
These ghosts are my clones.

198
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,570
They make people's hearts feel hollow.

199
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,750
You've reached the end of the line!

200
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,580
I can't believe that cutie is the mastermind
behind those annoying ghosts!

201
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,600
Save that for later!

202
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,590
If her attack hits us, we'll be goners in no time!

203
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,340
Our only option is to flee!

204
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,970
I can't fight ghosts!

205
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,260
Run for it!

206
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,680
Negative Hollow!

207
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,880
Mackerel... I'm worse than mackerel...

208
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,220
Yeah! I want a feral dog to step on me!

209
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,170
I'm sorry for walking on the same earth...

210
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,180
...as everyone else!

211
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,810
It's over! It's all over!

212
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,630
Apprehend them.

213
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,990
Yes, ma'am!

214
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,710
That was too easy.

215
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,170
Now to deal with the group upstairs.

216
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,190
Wild Shot: Salt Star!

217
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,060
Who did that?!

218
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,360
I won't let you...

219
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,330
...hurt my crew!

220
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,460
Shoot! He only pretended
to get hit by my attack!

221
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,230
I'll finish you off for real this time.

222
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,060
Negative Hollow!

223
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,620
What?!

224
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,580
My name is Captain Usopp.

225
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,840
Why?! Why aren't you falling to your knees?!

226
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,300
My ghost clearly hit you!

227
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,050
How did you counter it?

228
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,800
I didn't do anything to counter it.

229
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,310
I've always been negative!

230
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,150
What?!

231
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,630
He held out against the ghost's negative power!

232
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,580
This man is incredible!

233
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,080
Perona-sama!

234
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,110
That's absurd!

235
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,680
No one in the world could possibly
be immune to my Negative Hollow...!

236
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,760
Perona-sama!

237
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,030
People are alive...

238
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,470
That alone should be enough to
keep us looking forward with hope!

239
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,010
But this man...!

240
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,120
Hang in there...

241
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,920
--Hang in there!
--Hang in there!

242
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,300
Hang in there!

243
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,760
Hang in there! Hang in there! Hang in there!

244
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,630
"Live!!" "Hang in there!!!" "Fight!!"

245
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,630
--Hang in there! Hang in there!
--Don't try to cheer me up!

246
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,310
Snap out of it, guys!

247
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,560
You've gotta hurry and rescue Nami and Brook!

248
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,610
You guys--your abilities--
are powerless before this chick.

249
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,360
I'll take her on!

250
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,770
Dude...!

251
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,380
Why does he seem so dependable?

252
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,830
That didn't work on him?

253
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,330
Curse you!

254
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,240
But take out all of these
zombies before you go!

255
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,020
I can't defeat them! I'm sure I'd die if--

256
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,390
I'll let you handle things here!

257
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,340
Eh? Uh, no! That's not what I meant!

258
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,810
No! Hold up!

259
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,090
Wait!

260
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm done going easy on you.

261
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,830
Do you, Absalom, take Nami
to be your wedded wife?

262
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,550
To have and to hold in sickness and
in health, to love for all eternity?

263
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,510
Yeah, I do!

264
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:17,940
Do you, Nami, swear to love
Absalom for all eternity?

265
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,900
Yes, I rottin' do! I love Absalom-sama!

266
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,160
Then you may kiss the bride.

267
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,880
What's this?

268
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,960
When I pull it, the whole
ship moves. This is fun!

269
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,550
Let's go starboard next!

270
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,720
Which way is starboard again?

271
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,890
I can't remember!

272
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,310
Meatboard! I'll go wherever there is meat!

273
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,860
On the next episode of One Piece!

274
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,030
"The General Zombies Are Down in a Flash!!
Oars Feels Like an Adventure!!"

275
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
