00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,150
Zoro...!

24
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,360
Where is Luffy?

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,820
Did Luffy get cut down by Zoro?

26
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,200
Don't tell me... It can't be...

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,500
Where's our captain?

28
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,210
You damn swordsman...!

29
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,180
If you're gonna harm the ladies,
I'll be your opponent.

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,560
He said, "I still haven't
played my trump card yet"!

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:11,710
"The Last Counterattack by the Memory
Thief Who Revealed His True Colors!"

32
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,800
Oooh! All right! I'm... me!

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,140
Ahhh! I'm me!

34
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,860
Excuse me, but aren't you one of the guests?

35
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,700
That's right! I'm a guest!

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,620
Why am I dressed like this?

37
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,830
What're you doing, manager?!
Please come to the front desk right away!

38
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,630
So I was right... I'm the inn manager, aren't I?

39
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,380
M-Mom! Where have you been?!

40
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,390
I'm sorry. Are you okay? How have you been?

41
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,650
All right! Our memories...
Our memories are back!

42
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,320
E-Everyone! There's trouble!

43
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,450
Oh, it's you, Drim.

44
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,750
Don't scare us like that.

45
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,660
Drim... Drim...!

46
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,960
Mom! Mom!

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,710
So you're okay.

48
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,970
Looks like everyone's memories are back.

49
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,260
Good, good.

50
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,890
But how did something like that happen?

51
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,350
Everyone! There's trouble!

52
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,520
The one who took our
memories away is in the forest!

53
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,490
--What?!
--What?!

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,300
What's it saying?

55
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,130
"T-Take them out, Roronoa Zoro!"

56
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,090
So he said.

57
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,810
S-See? He's being controlled by that thing!

58
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,320
Hey, someone, do something...

59
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:57,040
Geez... You damn swordsman,
you're always bringing in trouble...!

60
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,290
Ahh, Sanji! Be careful!

61
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,050
Hm?

62
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,680
"Now this will buy me some time"?

63
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,890
Collier!

64
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,100
Huh?

65
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,280
Don't interfere...

66
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,570
...you idiot cook!

67
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,210
Oh? There he is!

68
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,130
Zoro!

69
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,940
So you're okay!

70
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,150
Luffy! What'd you do that for?!

71
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,610
Zoro, did you just... say "Luffy"?

72
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,570
Tsk.

73
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,280
So your memories are back?!

74
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,620
Of course.

75
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,160
Your face is scary! If your memories are back,

76
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,540
then approach us with
a smiling, kind face like this!

77
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,790
Argh! Shut up!

78
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,630
Ow!

79
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,130
Hm? Who am I?!

80
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,800
--Huh?!
--Hey! Don't make it more
complicated than it already is!

81
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,180
Ah, Zoro! How dare you do that earlier?!

82
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,520
Geez, do what you want, you guys...

83
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,520
Good! Now we're all back to normal.

84
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,610
Robin-chan really is wonderful, to figure out
that that sea horse horn is the real culprit.

85
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,150
What?! So that was it?!

86
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,320
You were the first one to
get your memories back.

87
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,490
Why didn't you notice it?

88
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,450
How rude! I'm better than Zoro!

89
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,410
So where did that thing go?

90
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,580
Ah...

91
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,500
Did it get away?

92
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,130
No...

93
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,590
...it's so obvious where it is.

94
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,530
You're right. It turned pale.

95
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,410
It should've hurried up and escaped.
Does it think it's hiding wel--

96
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:42,370
You bastard! How dare you manipulate me?!

97
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm gonna catch and fillet you!

98
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,170
Oh, his feelings are hurt in his own way.

99
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,880
"Now, catch me if you can!"

100
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,800
"You really piss me off! Hold it!"

101
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,590
"Hahaha! You can't catch me!"

102
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,390
"Then how about this?!"

103
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,260
"I'm right here!"

104
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,350
"What?! No way! Now, I'm getting serious!"

105
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,310
"There, I've caught you!"

106
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,820
"I'm not gonna let you go!"

107
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,120
You're next, Usopp!

108
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,450
"I'm going to play my... trump card"?!

109
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,380
What?!

110
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,850
C-Can't be...!

111
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,390
Bellemere-san... is that you?

112
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,400
Doctor...!

113
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,700
Kaya...!

114
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,570
Are you better now?

115
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,180
Whoa!

116
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,140
Whoooa!

117
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,520
How have you been?!

118
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,650
These are...

119
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,030
...afterimages of their memories...

120
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,920
You wanna fight, you jerks?!
I'll kick all your asses at once!

121
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,150
What's going on?!

122
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,780
Shoot...!

123
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,240
Dammit! I can't move!

124
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,660
What is it saying?

125
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,040
"Thanks to you guys, I even lost all the
memories I collected from the villagers.

126
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,340
But if I can obtain all your rich memories,

127
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,930
I can become one!"

128
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,140
Become what?

129
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,430
I don't know.

130
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,360
"I'm not going to miss this opportunity!"

131
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,800
What the heck is that?!

132
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,770
And...

133
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,430
...who am I?!

134
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,350
Who are you guys?

135
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,020
Who am I?

136
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,150
Hey, the one who's drowning over there!

137
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,030
--Huh?
--Do you know?

138
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,990
How would I know?!

139
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,710
"All right! I was able to
become a Millennial Dragon"?

140
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,040
--You...!
--Amazing! You can understand what it's saying?!

141
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,920
--Err...
--Hey... This raccoon dog talks!

142
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,220
Ahhh! Am I a raccoon dog?!

143
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,640
A talking raccoon dog and a Millennial Dragon...

144
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,470
And a damn bastard who almost drowned...

145
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,600
What the heck...?

146
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,360
Just watching that dragon...
somehow gets me pissed off! Why?!

147
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,030
What happened? How? Why?

148
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,990
Strange... Why am I here?

149
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,030
Amazing!

150
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,160
A dragon, huh? I wanna ride it!

151
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,910
Are you an idiot? There's no
way you can ride it from...

152
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,840
You don't know until you try... Ahh!

153
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,010
What the heck is he?!

154
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,720
What's going on?! My arms and legs stretch!

155
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,180
This is fun!

156
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,350
He really jumped on it...

157
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,730
Wait... What's with his body?!

158
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,860
He's a monster.

159
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,910
It's dangerous! Hey, keep still!

160
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,880
Somehow that thing looks like it's in pain.

161
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,590
"Let go of me! Hey! The memories
are going to leak out"?!

162
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,130
Memories?

163
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,910
Again and again...

164
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,410
How dare you steal our memories?!

165
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,210
You bastard!

166
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,550
What is it saying?! Chopper!

167
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,010
Chopper? M-Me?

168
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,260
Who else could it be?! Right?!

169
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,550
Yep!

170
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,680
"I was finally able to become a
Millennial Dragon! Don't interfere!"

171
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,310
Oh, yeah?!

172
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,240
People's memories aren't yours to take!

173
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,900
If you wanna become a Millennial Dragon,

174
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,990
become one by making your own big memory!

175
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,000
"Shut up! Take this! This is it!"

176
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,130
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

177
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,350
If you wanna fly that bad...

178
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,180
I'll send you flying!

179
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,470
--Hey...
--Hm?

180
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,510
You're gonna catch a cold.

181
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,570
I kicked its ass!

182
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,360
At any rate...

183
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,830
...if I remember right,
don't Millennial Dragons hatch from eggs?

184
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,290
Yeah. You can't become one
just by eating memories.

185
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,790
Is that right?

186
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,960
Yeah, you probably don't know it,

187
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,760
but we saw it with our own eyes
before we entered the Grand Line.

188
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,720
Really?

189
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,100
Well, forget that. People must be
making a racket in the village by now!

190
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,430
After all, we're their benefactors who
got all the villagers' memories back!

191
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,730
No doubt they're gonna treat us like heroes!

192
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,480
First all-you-can-drink party
we've had in a while, huh?

193
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,770
There's something you wanna forget?

194
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,690
Shut up.

195
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,150
Seems like we can expect
them to reward us good!

196
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,110
I want a bronze statue.

197
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,580
I'm gonna be so popular
with girls, huh? Not bad.

198
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,580
What about you, Robin? If you're able
to get something, what would you like?

199
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,410
Books, as expected?

200
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,540
Yeah. If possible, maybe books
on this island's history.

201
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,630
I knew it! I want a medical book--
one that's this thick!

202
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,510
We can see the seashore now.

203
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,980
Hey, ladies and gentlemen!
Thanks for coming to greet us!

204
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,060
Huh?

205
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,820
--What?!
--Why?!

206
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,280
U-Um... H-Hey...

207
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,990
I-It's them!

208
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,120
Everyone! Attack!

209
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,080
Ahhh! What's going on?!

210
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,870
Usopp! Aren't we supposed to be heroes?!

211
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,420
Beats me! I wanna ask that question myself!

212
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,380
Nami-san! Where's the waver?

213
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,840
This way!

214
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,670
Hold it! Stop right there, pirates!

215
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,550
You damn memory thieves!

216
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,510
You damn girl! Pay your bill!

217
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,720
What's with them?! They think we did it!

218
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,470
Looks like it.

219
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,650
Well, we're pirates. It can't be helped, huh?

220
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,110
Now that it's come to this,
we're to the point of desperation!

221
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Hey! Hold it! Stop it!

222
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,120
What pirate would stop just
because they're told to stop?!

223
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,510
I'm glad we made it back.

224
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,890
A big bronze statue... It was so close...

225
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,980
...to being built... A big, dark statue...

226
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,810
At any rate...

227
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:22,400
To think that losing memories
would turn into such a big fuss...

228
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
Yeah, I totally agree.

229
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,030
There was even some guy who
schemed to make us his pirate crew.

230
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,370
Well... Sanji-kun... I just got
carried away... I just got carried away.

231
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,500
On the other hand,

232
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,840
there was a damn simpleton
whose body and soul got taken over.

233
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,090
What'd you say?!

234
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,930
To start with, if you were
actually standing guard,

235
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,680
this racket wouldn't have happened,
you idiot moss-head!

236
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,930
Shut up! I was sleepy!

237
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,900
If you wanna sleep that much,
sleep for the rest of your life!

238
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,940
Argh! Shut up! That's enough!

239
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,740
Or would you like to lose your memories again?

240
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,120
Oh, Nami-san! Please don't say things like that!

241
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,710
My memories...

242
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,840
If I hadn't gotten my memories back...

243
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,920
...what would I have...

244
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,140
What's wrong... Robin?

245
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,180
What?

246
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,100
I'm okay.

247
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,930
I'm a little sleepy, that's all.

248
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,820
It's just natural. Robin-chan hasn't
slept much because of this racket.

249
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,690
--Oh, that's right!
--All right then!

250
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,570
I'll make a special healthy dinner with
a mixture of herbal medicines tonight!

251
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,870
Ah, food! I forgot about it!

252
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,030
Sanji! Food!

253
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,330
I'm gonna make it now, so just wait quietly!

254
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,660
--Say, Luffy.
--Hm?

255
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,620
Why didn't you come back
with Zoro at that time?

256
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,710
Oh... Well, I got stuck
under a rock Zoro cut down.

257
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,010
--A rock?!
--Yeah. That was one huge, hard rock.

258
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

259
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

260
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

261
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

262
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

263
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

264
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

265
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

266
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

267
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

268
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

269
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

270
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

271
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

272
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

273
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

274
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,200
Eternally... Eternally...

275
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,090
Now, things have been settled.
To the next island, full speed ahead!

276
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,680
Geez, you're full of hot air!

277
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,100
I think with this incident, you've all
learned how important memories are.

278
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,430
What are you trying to summarize for?

279
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,850
Hm? I feel like I just saw something
I don't wanna remember.

280
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,600
Oh, that Split-Head is...

281
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,980
Boss?!

282
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

283
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,400
"Proud Man! Silver Fox Foxy"

284
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,570
Him again?
