We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

want to do and doing them all

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,990

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,930
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,480
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,670
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,720
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,660
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,710
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,930
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,970
When Luffy found out that the prize for a

77
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,190
fighting event was the Flare-Flare
Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,790
Finally, the match for Block C
which Luffy registered for, started!

79
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,540
Let's do this together!

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,300
Meanwhile, Nami and the others who stayed
on the Thousand Sunny, encounter...

81
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,980
Wh-What's going on in here?!

82
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,240
"A Blow of Anger!
A Giant vs. Lucy!"

83
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,680
OFF THE COAST OF DRESSROSA

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,650
THE THOUSAND SUNNY

85
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,090
Wh-What is this?

86
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,150
What's going on in here?

87
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,180
It's so creepy.

88
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,150
Franky-san will be pissed if he sees this!

89
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,810
What?!

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,650
Th-The door got deformed, too!

91
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,270
Is she a Devil Fruit eater?!

92
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,780
But what kind?!

93
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,970
"BAD TASTE" Fruit?

94
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,520
Oh boy, oh boy!

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,710
I don't like people who
have no artistic sense!

96
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,110
W-Who are you?!

97
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,480
Be quiet!

98
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,930
Did you just call me a mermaid?

99
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,080
We didn't say that!

100
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,520
Whoa-whoa, who do you
think you're talking to?!

101
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,160
This is Giolla-sama of
the Don Quixote Family!

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,550
GIOLLA
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY
(THE TRÉBOL ARMY)

103
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,280
The Don Quixote Family?!

104
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,610
Oh boy!

105
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,830
My soul is swinging!

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,150
I see an image! My mind is gonna erupt!

107
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,550
It's gonna explode!
An image of liberty and beauty!

108
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,720
Wh-What the...

109
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,320
Oh my face!

110
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,830
It got all flattened and smooth!
How dare you!

111
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,960
No!

112
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,840
Hey you! What do you think you're doing?!

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,170
It's art. A work of art.

114
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,610
I know you ordinary people
can't understand art.

115
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,350
Cut the art crap! Turn us back!

116
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,070
Yeah, turn us back!

117
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,670
No no, I can't do that.

118
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,690
All right, I can turn you back if you want.

119
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,220
But in exchange, you need to hand Momonosuke

120
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,290
over to us without any trouble!

121
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,830
Don't worry, Momo-chan!
We won't let them take you!

122
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,350
I heard you!

123
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,320
Oh, my soul is swinging!

124
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,370
I'm gonna make you more beautiful!

125
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,660
Here it comes again!

126
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,110
If we get distorted anymore,
what will we look like?!

127
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,860
They're gone!

128
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,200
--There is a hatch!
--Should we go after them?

129
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,370
Oh boy, oh boy! What a pain!

130
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,430
--There they are!
--When did they get out there?!

131
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,140
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
Get back here!

132
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,100
Or I'll make you look more like art pieces!

133
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,850
Screw you!

134
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,960
You can't reach us with your
bizarre power ever again!

135
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,340
That's right!

136
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,080
Just try it!

137
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Oh boy, oh boy!

138
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,160
She's getting mad, just as we planned.

139
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,040
Uh-huh.

140
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,500
Boy, if she keeps using that weird power,

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,800
the Sunny will get all messed up!

142
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,540
I know Franky-san will be furious

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,490
but aside from that, can
we even turn it back?

144
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,170
The room that used to be
the men's dormitory...

145
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,720
I don't know.

146
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,290
But all we can do now is
try to keep it from getting

147
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,600
any more screwed up!

148
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,240
I hope she focuses out this way!

149
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,050
Away from the ship!

150
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,180
Huh?

151
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,420
She's going to the other side!

152
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,020
What's going on?

153
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,940
How annoying! Oh boy, oh boy!

154
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,190
Hey, guys!

155
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,680
Yes, ma'am!

156
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,360
I-Is that...

157
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,110
Doflamingo's submarine?!

158
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,100
Ah, so that's how they got here!

159
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,910
They came hiding in the fog, didn't they?!

160
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,600
This is no good.

161
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,780
I didn't realize there were so many of them!

162
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,190
What are you guys doing?!
They're going to get away!

163
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Just go and take Momonosuke away
from them already!

164
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,890
Yes, Giolla-sama!

165
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,540
My soul is swinging! I see an image!

166
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,670
My mind is gonna erupt!

167
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,210
Oh, she's gonna do it again!

168
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,340
Hello?! We're here!

169
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,920
You have to aim at us!

170
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,480
Don't bother with the ship! We're here!

171
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,590
Oh, it's gonna explode!
An image of liberty and beauty!

172
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,390
No!

173
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,300
The world should be free!

174
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,230
Shouldn't it?!

175
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,470
Damn!

176
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,050
She did it! We're in big trouble!

177
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,430
This is what beauty is!

178
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,280
What do you think?
Isn't it beautiful?

179
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,020
Oh no! You can't call it a ship anymore!

180
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,570
Oh boy, oh boy!

181
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,020
I'm not gonna fall for your trick!

182
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,170
Young Master-sama ordered
me to kidnap Momonosuke

183
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,300
and hijack your ship!

184
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:41,590
Now, there is no way for you Straw Hats
to escape from Dressrosa!

185
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,450
Our plan failed!

186
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,480
Just give up and surrender yourselves!

187
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,950
I don't need any medical attention!

188
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,650
I'm leaving!

189
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,830
Mr. Ricky! We can't just let you go!

190
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,670
Our job is to take care of all competitors
including treatment of injuries,

191
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,330
especially you guests.

192
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,460
Treatment?

193
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,100
You let people kill each other
in front of an audience!

194
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,770
Cut the treatment crap!

195
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,320
You're bleeding from the head!

196
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,020
Take off your mask and let us take a look!

197
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,620
Don't touch my mask!

198
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,070
A-Are you alright, Mr. Ricky?

199
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,680
I don't need treatment.

200
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,060
Open the exit!

201
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,270
No, we're not allowed to do that.

202
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,890
Everybody, hold him down.
He's badly wounded!

203
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,700
This is serious.

204
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,390
You have to get treated.

205
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,930
Here.

206
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,080
Move! I can walk by myself!

207
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,300
Go straight and take the
stairs to the basement.

208
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,410
Rebecca... I'm sorry.

209
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,210
A WAITING ROOM FOR THE DON
QUIXOTE FAMILY IN THE COLOSSEUM

210
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,180
Straw Hat is fighting in
the match now, Diamante.

211
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,420
After the match is fine.

212
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,530
Joker wants me to kill Straw Hat?

213
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,910
Doffy's too indulgent.

214
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,900
He's giving the man who couldn't
win the match one more chance.

215
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,660
Aren't you happy, Bellamy?
Assassination is an easy task.

216
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,760
Finish it up before the competition's over.

217
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,160
Hey, Bellamy! Don't give up!

218
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,850
Then, you'll get promoted
to be an executive of the Family.

219
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,940
I heard you're trying
to kill Lucy, Cavendish.

220
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,500
You're Bartolomeo, aren't you?
Congrats on making it to final.

221
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,820
About Lucy, it's none of your business.

222
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,040
No, that man is...

223
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,120
...not yours to kill!

224
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,810
I see. You want to kill him, too.

225
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,300
Because he's in the limelight!

226
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,290
But I'm the one who will kill him.
I won't let anybody else to do it.

227
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,840
Of course, you're no exception!

228
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,530
If you get in my way, you'll get hurt.

229
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,110
You scare me!

230
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,970
My connection with him is much deeper.

231
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,240
Many people are eliminated already!

232
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,120
The battle for Block C is heating up!

233
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,900
It's so fierce both
offensively and defensively!

234
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,670
But even though they're all tough fighters,

235
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,670
there is one giant warrior who is
literally sticking out!

236
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,110
He is a warrior of the new generation
from the famous Giants' country - Elbaf!

237
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,400
The most formidable "Pirate Mercenary"!

238
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
His name is...

239
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,110
...Hajrudin!!

240
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,020
He's gigantic!

241
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,400
You're too big, you bastard!
That's not fair!

242
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,570
Have you ever seen a Giant
who ate a Logia fruit?

243
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,180
That's what I'll become once
I win the Flare-Flare Fruit!

244
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,150
I'm gonna become the king of...

245
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,720
...all Giants!

246
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,340
With just a single blow!
It was like lightning!

247
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,080
Who can stop him?!

248
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,200
Whoa, on the other hand,

249
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,030
there is a fighting bull
running out of control

250
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,050
showing no fear for all those tough contenders!

251
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,800
He's a killer bull who slayed
21 death row prisoners

252
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,150
during a fight in this very Colosseum!

253
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,920
The Colosseum's Grim Reaper!

254
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,050
Because of his behavior, people call him Brutal Bull!

255
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,910
And somehow, someone knows how to tame
and ride this Grim Reaper!

256
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,260
Bursting into prominence,
with his cool strength,

257
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,700
he instantly became a crowd favorite!

258
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,160
Lucy!

259
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,670
Go Usy (bull)!

260
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,730
I like that guy, too!

261
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,990
Gyats-san, you should be impartial!

262
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,780
Good boy! Go, go!
Take them all down!

263
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,250
He became popular even under
a fake name! Straw Hat!

264
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,110
What a funny guy.

265
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,970
Go Ucy!

266
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,700
Oh?

267
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,990
Oh no, they're challenging Hajrudin!

268
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,180
Do you wanna fight me?

269
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,030
Oh, crap! Run, Ucy!

270
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,330
Ucy!

271
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,110
Bull!

272
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,660
Bull!

273
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,660
Lucy!

274
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,110
What a disappointment!

275
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,170
It was obviously a mismatch!

276
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,950
The rookie from Elbaf...

277
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,440
...crushed the Colosseum's Grim Reaper
and the unknown gladiator - Lucy.

278
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,020
Gyats-san!

279
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,790
They couldn't do anything...

280
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,800
The Giant's been knocked down!
