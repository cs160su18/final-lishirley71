2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,020
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,940
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,--

11
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,490
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

12
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,910
They landed on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen.

13
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,310
After forming an alliance with Trafalgar Law,

14
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,250
Luffy finally encountered Caesar Clown

15
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,500
but was beaten by his mysterious power.

16
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:59,300
Meanwhile, Law, too, got taken down by
the Navy G-5 base commander - Vergo.

17
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,510
R...

18
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,800
Run!!

19
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,130
Straw Hat-ya...

20
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,680
We can't miss a beat here.

21
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,770
Let's fight back.

22
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,240
"Launching the Counter Attack!
Luffy and Law's Great Escape!"

23
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,500
A member of the Seven
Warlords - Trafalgar Law.

24
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,470
A pirate who was on the news recently
for making a stunning comeback -

25
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,330
Straw Hat Luffy.

26
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,670
And his comrade--the
Devil Child - Nico Robin.

27
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,770
The Wild Dog of the Navy--"White
Chase" - Smoker.

28
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,520
How did these big-timers end up

29
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,140
VARIOUS PLACES IN THE NEW WORLD

30
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,640
being captured by Caesar?

31
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,650
What?!

32
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,700
It's them! So that's where they are!

33
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,150
What should we do?

34
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,450
Let's see how things go for a while-bon.

35
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,620
Hey, they are...

36
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,760
He finally got off his ass! Straw Hat!

37
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,710
EUSTASS "CAPTAIN" KID

38
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,430
THE CAPTAIN OF THE KID PIRATES BOUNTY:
470 MILLION BERRIES

39
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,860
It's no use watching it.

40
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,550
And you're not the kind of guy...

41
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,690
...who wants to play an arms trader, are you?

42
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,800
KILLER

43
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,550
Killer.

44
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,140
A CREW MEMBER OF THE KID PIRATES BOUNTY:
200 MILLION BERRIES

45
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,640
You're right.

46
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,170
But I can't believe those
three are there together.

47
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,110
Yeah, that asshole - Trafalgar!

48
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,440
I thought he had lost his mind when
he became the Government's dog

49
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,620
but to nobody's surprise,
he was up to something.

50
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Is he gonna start something?

51
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,290
We don't wanna fall behind! Let's move!

52
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,500
Kid, I beg you. Settle it peacefully.

53
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,040
I know! So shut up, already!

54
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,430
SCRATCHMEN APOO

55
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,160
Hey, Captain Kid!

56
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,310
BASIL HAWKINS

57
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,480
You look annoying as always!

58
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,780
Scratchmen! What are you doing?!

59
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,910
You made a big mess out of our lair!

60
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,700
Sorry, Captain! We couldn't stop him!

61
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,850
I was making sure that

62
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,960
you didn't have any snipers.

63
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,040
THE CAPTAIN OF THE ON AIR PIRATES BOUNTY:
350 MILLION BERRIES

64
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,460
Anyone would do so

65
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,040
when he gets summoned by his enemy.

66
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,090
See, Killer?!

67
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,630
This is why I told you not to call him!

68
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,170
Calm down. He's a powerful man.

69
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,940
THE CAPTAIN OF THE HAWKINS PIRATES BOUNTY:
320 MILLION BERRIES

70
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,050
How thoughtless of you to

71
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,930
keep a guest you invited waiting.

72
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,600
You assholes...

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm gonna kill you both now!

74
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,950
Oh, I knew that's what you wanted!

75
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,770
I'm ready for it!

76
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,480
Bring it on! Check it out!

77
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,900
This is so stupid. I'm leaving.

78
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,700
Wait, Hawkins! Not so soon!

79
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,830
Everyone! Enough already!

80
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,120
We wanted to discuss...

81
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,100
...forming an alliance
with both of your groups!

82
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,100
Don't you guys even know how to talk?!

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,470
Fighting back?

84
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,640
Yeah, it's no use wasting our time here.

85
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,420
Let's get it over with.

86
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,270
Can anybody here burn things?

87
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,360
If nobody can, that's fine, too.

88
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,990
Franky can set fires.

89
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,880
He can even shoot a laser beam!

90
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,740
Oh yeah!

91
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,860
Why don't you burn this chain with the beam?

92
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,290
I need to use both hands
to shoot the Radical Beam.

93
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,290
The only thing I can shoot is...

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,760
...Coup de Boo from my ass!

95
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,230
Whatever.

96
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,130
Can you set fire to the Navy
ship down there on the right?

97
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,820
Huh? That one?

98
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,090
That's as easy as pie, young man!

99
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,390
You can count on me!

100
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,300
Franky...

101
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,650
...Fireball!

102
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,480
--The ship is on fire!
--Run!

103
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,870
Put out the fire!

104
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,460
What is he doing? Is he just desperate?

105
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,170
That Pacifista-esque guy!

106
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,760
It's no use.

107
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,860
After the experiment,

108
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,180
I'll chop up their bodies
and put them to good use.

109
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,600
--I can't see the cage because of the smoke!
--Captain-chan, you okay?!

110
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,440
--Smo-yan, is it smoky there?!
--Fool! He's a smoke man in the first place!

111
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,960
Hey, Trafalgar! It's getting so smoky here!

112
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,540
You're the one who did it.

113
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,670
You made me do it!

114
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,460
What are you doing?

115
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,760
Well then...

116
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
What?!

117
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,430
Now that we are not being picked up
on Caesar's Video Transponder Snail.

118
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,560
They're not gonna find out for a while.

119
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,300
You're unbelievable!

120
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,900
How did you free yourself
from Sea Prism Stone chain?

121
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,530
Well, mine was just an ordinary
chain from the beginning.

122
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,490
What?

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,070
So I untied myself easily with my power.

124
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,200
Room!

125
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,180
Do you know how many months I've been here?

126
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,960
Just in case of an emergency,

127
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,370
I put a number of regular chains
everywhere in the laboratory.

128
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,520
So I could avoid Sea Prism Stone

129
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,930
even if I got caught by accident.

130
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,130
I'm free!

131
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,650
Quit cheering, fool.

132
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,740
Yeah, yeah, I'm free!

133
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,910
--Yeah, yeah, I'm free!
--Now...

134
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,030
...what should I do with you two?

135
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,050
You've learned a little too much.

136
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,960
I have your destiny in my hands.

137
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,140
You know what you wanna
do with it, don't you?

138
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,640
Just do it already!

139
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,610
Smoker-san?!

140
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,720
We're back to ourselves!

141
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,030
Don't scream like a woman, young girl!

142
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,870
J-Just untie us!

143
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,280
I'd do anything you say!

144
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,430
Stop it, Tashigi!

145
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,330
Wouldn't you rather die than
grovel before a pirate?!

146
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,120
Right now, we have to beg for our lives,

147
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,910
throwing ourselves at his
feet if that's what it takes!

148
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,920
Because if we die here,

149
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,030
we can't save our people
and Vice Admiral Vergo...

150
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,220
I mean, Vergo will act as
he pleases in the Navy.

151
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,060
And the children...

152
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,230
We can't die here!

153
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,740
She's a little smarter than you.

154
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,260
White Chase-ya, I have
no obligation to save you

155
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,400
but if letting you go back to the base safely

156
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,120
makes Vergo lose his footing,
it works out well for me.

157
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,060
However, you need to forget everything
that you heard about me and Joker.

158
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,740
I'm not asking you a favor. It's a condition.

159
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,440
For sparing your life.

160
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,590
I can't see anything!

161
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,430
What's going on out there?

162
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,750
Yeah, I finally got out!

163
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,310
--Aha!
--What are you...

164
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,480
Yeehaw!

165
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,170
Hey, wait!

166
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,860
How dare he do whatever the pleases!

167
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,180
It's not like the cage is
made of Sea Prism Stone.

168
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,230
Our captain does that sort of thing
as soon as your back is turned.

169
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,790
That fool!

170
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,610
Hey, Tra-guy!

171
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,880
Aha!

172
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,030
How should I get in?!

173
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,890
Hey, young man.

174
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,060
I'd rather take care of the Sunny.

175
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,670
Do as you like.

176
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,630
Alright then, see you later!

177
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,650
Coup de...

178
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,220
...Boo!

179
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,610
I'm coming for you, Sunny!

180
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,870
I'm counting on you, Franky!

181
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,930
Oh, it stinks!

182
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,810
Why are you looking at me like that?

183
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,940
Hey! What are you waiting for, Tra-guy?!

184
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,170
Hey, Smo-yan!

185
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,240
Captain-chan! Are you okay?!

186
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,950
What should we do?!

187
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,750
Hey, look. It's already...

188
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,630
The poison gas will get here any minute!

189
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,700
If nothing is done, just like
people in that video, we...

190
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,950
I-It's no good! We need to
get inside the building now!

191
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,710
--Open the shutter!
--Damn it! Open up!

192
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,970
Run!

193
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,100
We can run faster like this
but it's catching up to us!

194
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,660
The dragon is so far ahead!

195
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,210
Let's catch it and fly already!

196
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,480
--I can't...
--Sanji-san, stay with us!

197
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't run anymore!

198
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,410
Nami-san's cardiopulmonary
functions can't take it anymore!

199
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,960
The chest feels tight!

200
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,120
Her chest... Breasts...

201
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,790
Breasts!

202
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,780
I caught it!

203
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,840
What kind of stupid power was that?!

204
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,660
--The smoke is closing in!
--That creepy color...

205
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,180
It must be very poisonous!

206
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,750
Sorry, Brownbeard-chi!

207
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,150
You're badly wounded but
you have to carry us!

208
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,080
No problem. It's just like carrying dwarves.

209
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,780
I have to save my men anyway!

210
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,680
We have to save those kids!

211
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,310
I hope they haven't eaten those candies!

212
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,220
Hey, look! What is that?!

213
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,200
There! Somebody's running from the gas!

214
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,610
A dragon?

215
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,280
Don't tell me that's...

216
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,200
Can't you run more quietly?!

217
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,310
I mean, why doesn't it fly?!

218
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,560
I don't need a dragon's help!

219
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,610
Cut it out, guys!

220
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,440
We caught it thanks to Nami-san's sexy body!

221
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,450
Just by thinking about it, I...

222
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,660
This is no time for a nosebleed, you pervert!

223
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,490
The poison gas is catching up to us!

224
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,410
My arm muscles can't take it...

225
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,130
Oh, I don't have muscles!

226
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,500
Brook!

227
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,950
--Brook!
--That was close!

228
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,320
--Usopp!
--N-Nami-san?!

229
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,040
Let's keep running!

230
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,690
Why are you here?!

231
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,480
We have tons of questions,
too, but they can wait!

232
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,440
Let's get to the lab!

233
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,010
Yeah!

234
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,450
Hey, he's getting tired!

235
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,830
The gas will get us if nothing is done!

236
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,210
You all have to jump on my back!

237
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,460
Thank you!

238
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,960
Ouch!

239
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,050
Oh, this is good!

240
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,010
Good! Just go like that!

241
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,140
--That's nice!
--We're counting on you, Brownbeard!

242
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,260
You people are horrible!

243
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,720
--Hey! Hurry up!
--We're gonna die!

244
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,390
Damn! Damn! Damn! Shit! Shit! Shit!

245
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,910
Just open!

246
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,690
Th-The poison gas is...

247
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,360
...coming over the mountain!

248
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,340
Dammit!

249
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,870
This is it... We're gonna die...

250
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,230
The poison gas will reach here soon!

251
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,650
Smo-yan and Captain-chan can't even escape!

252
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,610
We're all gonna die!!

253
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,680
The shutter's opening!

254
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,100
--We have a problem!
--The shutter's opening!

255
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,400
Who touched the lever?!

256
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,380
Damn it! G-5 soldiers are
entering one after another!

257
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,600
--What's going on?!
--Hey, look!

258
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,950
N-No way!

259
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,750
The Navy G-5 Vice Admiral Smoker!

260
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,320
The Warlord - Trafalgar Law!

261
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,960
The pirate - Straw Hat Luffy!

262
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,430
I thought they were held
captive by the Master!

263
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,350
Good! Everyone's inside!

264
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,150
Now, what should I do with my heart?

265
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,110
I'm getting excited!

266
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Why am I doing this with these guys...

267
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,560
Smo-yan! Captain-chan! You're alive!

268
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,830
Now, nobody's left outside!

269
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,700
We're safe from the poison gas!

270
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,850
What's that?

271
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,540
Ouch!

272
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,350
We arrived at the lab!

273
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait!

274
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,120
Don't close the shutter!

275
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,210
Damn! We're so close!

276
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,290
Open it! Let us get inside!

277
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:24,070
Oh no! They're cutting us off!
We're gonna be killed by the gas!

278
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,970
We can't make it. We're
going to kingdom come.

279
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,970
Hey, Kin'emon!

280
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,640
Can you cut iron?

281
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,440
That's not so hard to cut!

282
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,730
Brownbeard, keep charging like this!

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,590
That's ridiculous!

284
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,940
I'm gonna crash into the wall!

285
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,700
Then do you wanna be
killed by the poison gas?

286
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,390
No way!

287
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,770
Who cares!

288
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,230
I'm gonna charge!

289
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,210
We don't have any other option now, do we?

290
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,980
Yeah, it's hit-or-miss!

291
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,680
Let's take a chance!

292
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,900
Are you ready?

293
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,050
Of course!

294
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
It's Zoro and the others!

295
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,210
That's a bizarre entrance!

296
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,420
What?!

297
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,730
They cut the shutter!

298
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,940
Hey! Everybody's here, huh?

299
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,020
Luffy!

300
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,110
Luffy-san!

301
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,610
Luffy!

302
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,950
We're all back together!

303
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,840
Alright! Let's let loose!

304
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,750
The Straw Hats manage to escape the clutches of Shinokuni and reunite.

305
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,890
However, their only remaining escape route is through the door to Building R.

306
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,140
Facing extreme circumstances...

307
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,640
...they finally signal the counterattack!

308
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

309
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,900
"Get to Building R!
The Pirate Alliance's Great Advance!"

310
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
