00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's go

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to lose something precious

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
I'll keep getting back up

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Because I don't want to lose something precious

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
To the future I believe in...

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,350
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,590
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,690
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,610
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,660
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,520
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,460
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,980
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,230
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

63
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,590
Luffy and the Whitebeards are
trying to make it to the scaffold

64
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,060
but they have been walled in!

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,080
But with Jimbei's help,
Luffy was able to get over the wall

66
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,750
and finally make it to the plaza!

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,680
Luffy!

68
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,310
I'm on my way!

69
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,600
Ace!

70
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,390
Wh-What is that?!

71
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,310
We're enclosed!

72
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,290
What the hell is this?!

73
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,160
Do it, Akainu!

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,120
Meteor Volcano!

75
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,260
He's firing lava fists into the air!

76
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,570
They can't get away!

77
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,350
Melt the ice that they're standing on!

78
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,390
I'm sorry...

79
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,780
The plan is going well!

80
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,880
Now let's move on to...

81
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,270
...the execution of Portgaz D. Ace...

82
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,590
...immediately!

83
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,060
Jimbei!

84
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,860
I need you to do me a favor!

85
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,890
Ocean Current Shoulder Throw!

86
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,030
Oh no! You finally made it!

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,630
You're standing tall, Dragon's son!

88
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,750
It scares me! His youthfulness!

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm gonna get Ace back!!

90
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,390
Gum-Gum...

91
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,930
...Stamp Gatling!

92
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,030
"Moving into the Final Phase!
Whitebeard's Trump Card for Recovery!"

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,010
I can't believe that he's
attacking the 3 admirals openly!

94
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,470
He's a damn fool! They're gonna kill him!

95
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,360
Second Gear!

96
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,500
I don't have time to fight those guys!

97
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,960
He fooled us!

98
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,430
You're too slow!

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,420
Luffy-san!

100
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,520
I told you!

101
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,200
Damn!

102
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,880
Be ready!

103
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,960
Yes, sir!

104
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,650
Do it!

105
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,570
Ace!

106
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,020
Ace-san!

107
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,060
Ace!!

108
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,720
Ace!!

109
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,730
Who did this?!

110
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,880
You bastard!

111
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,240
I thought that it was to
our advantage to have you

112
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,280
since you hold a grudge against Whitebeard.

113
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,350
Crocodile!

114
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,780
That guy!

115
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,230
What is this? I thought this
was my chance to show off.

116
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,520
He was trying to kill the good old man before.

117
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,210
The winds have changed!

118
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,220
I can kill that old, dying buzzard later.

119
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,330
But before that,

120
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,300
I don't want to let you taste victory!

121
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,610
Hey, you, gator guy!

122
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,500
D-Doflamingo!

123
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,360
You turned me down and now,
you wanna team up with Whitebeard?

124
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,970
It makes me jealous.

125
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm not gonna team up with anybody.

126
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,170
So that means you are still
giving me the cold shoulder.

127
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,280
Looks like it.

128
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,830
I don't know what this is
all about but it's helpful!

129
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,740
This is it, Straw Hat!

130
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,610
Die!

131
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,330
Don't get in...

132
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,720
...my way!

133
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,720
Stop, Straw Hat!

134
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,940
I won't let you go any further!

135
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,740
--Outta my way!
--Shave!

136
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,770
Moon Walk!

137
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,230
Iron Body...

138
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,040
...Smash!

139
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,290
Gum-Gum...

140
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,570
Iron Body!

141
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,550
...Bullet!

142
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,000
Stop Straw Hat!

143
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,960
Don't let him go any further!

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,520
Admiral Sakazuki!

145
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,810
That hurts! Dammit!

146
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,180
I owed a favor to your grandfather

147
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
but I have no choice!

148
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,300
Because you chose to risk your life!

149
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,460
You fool! I won't let you do that to Luffy...

150
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,830
Admiral!

151
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,640
That's...!

152
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,750
1st division commander--Marco!

153
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,980
Thanks! You saved me!

154
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,600
Don't mention it!

155
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,160
We've got three invaders in the plaza!

156
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,590
Devil Fruit eaters can fly over the walls!

157
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,170
Th... Three?

158
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,210
A-Am I one of the three
that they're talking about?

159
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,970
But when did they find out about me?!

160
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,900
I escaped Admiral Aokiji's attack by a hair

161
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,010
and survived so many deadly crises!

162
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,610
And finally I got this far!

163
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,500
But I'm not safe here either!

164
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,660
Isn't there any place safe?!

165
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,290
Someone's coming!

166
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,570
That was...

167
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,550
INSIDE THE BAY OF MARINEFORD

168
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,510
Go across the sea towards Oars!

169
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,810
Get to the plaza whatever it takes!

170
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,390
Fleet Admiral-dono!

171
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,100
The pirates inside the bay are acting strangely!

172
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,060
Go across the sea towards Oars!

173
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,140
Get to the plaza whatever it takes!

174
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,220
They are desperate.

175
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,550
Defend the open space in the wall!

176
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,400
Yes, sir!

177
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,010
They've gone crazy after losing their ships and the

178
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,810
ice they stood on, stupid pirates!

179
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,450
They're fair game for us! Shoot!

180
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,400
Don't hesitate! Keep going forward!

181
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,380
Head towards Oars!

182
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,390
Get to the plaza!

183
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,700
Wh-What's wrong with them?

184
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,250
How can they keep their
morale in this situation?!

185
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,760
Advance!

186
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,200
Everybody, get on board!

187
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,350
Hold on tight!

188
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,850
N-No way! It's a ship!

189
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,980
We have a problem!

190
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,200
Another coated ship is entering the bay!

191
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,090
Dammit! It must've been hidden
at the bottom of sea all this!

192
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,120
I don't remember saying that
that was all of our ships.

193
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,210
It's a paddle boat!
It's coming towards us at full speed!

194
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,000
What?!

195
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,390
Sink it like the Moby Dick!

196
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,780
No! Not the boat! Shoot at Oars!

197
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,820
Huh? Why Oars?

198
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,320
It's too late!

199
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,700
Get ready, everybody!

200
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,500
He pulled the boat out of water!

201
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,950
They broke the encircling walls!

202
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,370
We made it to the plaza!

203
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,320
Let's save Ace!

204
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,330
Let's burn down Navy HQ!

205
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,210
Wait for us, Ace!

206
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,850
They got us!

207
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,350
There was only a space the size of a rathole!

208
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,210
But they went for it wisely!

209
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,940
The walls could become
an obstacle for us this time!

210
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,690
Pops!

211
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,450
Whitebeard!

212
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,660
You still have your head, right, Ace?!

213
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,680
We did it!

214
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,750
Now we can save Ace-kun...

215
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,460
Oars!

216
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,890
Save Ace-kun at any cost...

217
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,810
Oars...

218
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,010
Whitebeard has descended to the plaza!

219
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,080
Stay back, my sons!

220
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,160
Guys! Rescue Ace and...

221
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,720
...destroy the Navy!!

222
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,670
Garp.

223
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,170
Yeah.

224
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,530
I don't think we can make it
through this unscathed!

225
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,130
I'm on my way, Ace!

226
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,050
At last, Whitebeard stands before Ace!

227
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,100
But he's faced with the two admirals Aokiji and Akainu,

228
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,270
and the conflict becomes a battle royal.

229
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,210
Amidst the chaos, Marco finds an opportunity

230
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,430
to make a dash toward Ace!

231
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,350
On the next episode of One Piece!

232
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,860
"Luffy at the End of His Tether!
An All-out Battle at the Oris Plaza!"

233
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
