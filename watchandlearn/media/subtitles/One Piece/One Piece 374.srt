2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,820
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,060
O-Oars is back on his feet!

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,310
I don't know what happened to Luffy,
but he dealt plenty of damage.

49
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,650
Pierna Fleurs!

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,610
The weather forecast is rain!

51
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,360
Cool Ball!

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,610
Rain Tempo!

53
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,820
Crank it like mad!

54
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,620
I'm cranking it!

55
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,410
Here it comes! It's the Super Cold Cannon
connected to the extra-large freezer!

56
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,830
Fire!

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,170
Now it's my turn!

58
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,470
Darn it!

59
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,680
Go!

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,140
Not a chain!

61
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,440
Be careful.

62
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,770
Third Gear!

63
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,520
Bone Balloon!

64
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,610
Zoro, push in Oars' stomach.

65
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,320
Three-Sword Style...

66
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,870
...Secret Technique!

67
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,530
Three Thousand Worlds!

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,630
Here goes nothing.

69
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,260
Gum-Gum...

70
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,470
...Giant Bazooka!

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,490
He did it!

72
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,910
Now go smack Moria awake
and make him return our shadows.

73
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,910
The sun is almost up!

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,790
I don't need... a wakeup call.

75
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,750
Moria!

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,630
Straw Hat, how dare you
trash my Thriller Bark?!

77
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,720
I lost my crew because they were alive!

78
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,680
But with undead zombies,
I have nothing to lose!

79
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,090
Come to me, all of the
shadows on Thriller Bark!

80
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,760
Serve as my power!

81
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,030
Shadows Asgard!

82
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,910
Bro!

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,290
He's collecting all of the shadows
on the island and absorbing them.

84
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,710
Straw Hat, I'd say you absorbed
around 100 shadows.

85
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,700
In that case, I'm absorbing 100...

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,320
200!

87
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,220
300!

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,310
400!

89
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,730
500!

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,610
600!

91
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,200
700!

92
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,790
800!

93
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,590
900!

94
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,600
1,000 shadows!

95
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,760
"Our Bodies Vanish! The Morning Sun
Shines on the Nightmarish Island!"

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,890
A thousand...

97
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,950
...shadows...

98
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,120
...are inside of Moria!

99
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,530
We're in a load of...

100
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,690
This can't be real.

101
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,300
We're doomed. What the heck is that?

102
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,520
I'm back to normal.

103
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,430
It's as good as dawn!

104
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,980
We're out of time!

105
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,390
Oars was a pushover for Straw Hat
when he had 100 shadows.

106
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,030
And he has ten times that!
Where is he storing all of that power?

107
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,570
Since it's his power, he must have
way better control of the ability!

108
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,670
Th-This is hopeless!

109
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,950
We've come too far for
crap like this! It's not fair!

110
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,470
He even has Straw Hat's shadow.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,430
Yeah.

112
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,010
I imagine he has ours as well.

113
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,960
They're all inside...

114
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,480
...of his stomach.

115
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,270
Right.

116
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,400
Run! This is a lost cause!

117
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

118
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,450
He put a crack in the island!

119
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,620
The mansion attached to
the mast is collapsing!

120
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,310
Run for it! Head for the forest!

121
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,380
It's over for real this time!

122
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,180
No! I'm gonna vanish!
My body is gonna vanish!

123
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,140
Please save me!

124
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,310
Stupid! Hurry into the shadows.

125
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,560
The morning sun is coming through!

126
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,020
Make your way to the forest
through the shadows!

127
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,790
Don't leave the buildings' shadows!

128
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,690
Captain Lola!

129
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,340
Captain Lola, what's keeping you? Hurry up!

130
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,340
Guys, please run for it.

131
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,090
H-How could you say that?
You're in the same boat!

132
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,050
But I'm responsible...

133
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,480
...for this gamble!

134
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,650
Just look at them.

135
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,360
Those guys...

136
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,330
They aren't the least bit fazed.

137
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,590
And here they've lost their shadows as well.

138
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,940
Do they still intend to win?

139
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,900
But all it took was one hit for him
to put a crack in the island!

140
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,020
Right now, Moria is way more
powerful than Oars ever was!

141
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,180
As long as they intend to fight,
I'm not leaving this spot!

142
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,500
If we selfishly place our faith
in him as the "Star of Hope"

143
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,550
and then split as soon
as the going gets tough,

144
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,470
we're no better than lowly insects!

145
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,150
But this situation is hopeless!

146
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,760
I want you to escape.

147
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,110
As the captain, our obligation
will be met if I stay behind.

148
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,710
Guys... Treasure your lives.

149
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,060
Captain Lola!

150
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,870
The sun is shining over there!
Hurry into the shade!

151
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm fine!

152
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,490
This is what it means to
place your hope in someone!

153
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,630
Captain Lola!

154
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,920
No...! Do you want to die?!

155
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,170
I'm either going to live or die!

156
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,400
I don't care which way the coin flips.

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,930
I will never go back to
hiding in the shadows!

158
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,260
Captain!

159
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
He's practically going berserk.

160
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,500
He doesn't have full control of the shadows.

161
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,750
It looks like anger and foolish pride
made him overestimate himself.

162
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,750
Hey, guys. We're out of time.

163
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,390
I'm gonna push myself a bit.

164
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,710
Please take care of things after that!

165
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Okay, you can count on us!

166
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,210
Send him flying!

167
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,620
Hey, you guys! What makes
you think you stand a chance?

168
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,370
There is no way you'll win!

169
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,960
You're up against a monster
that's a thousand strong!

170
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,880
Right! Stop and think for a second.

171
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,290
He even has your shadows!

172
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,590
He has your monstrous power!

173
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,890
And we're running out of time!

174
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,320
If you're here to watch, shut your trap.

175
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,650
We've already won the fight with Moria.

176
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,860
But it all comes down to finishing
things before the sun rises.

177
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,450
Moria plans to use his insane power
to buy that brief period of time.

178
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,550
Second Gear!

179
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,010
Will we get obliterated first?

180
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,800
Or will Moria self-destruct first?

181
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,520
Go, Luffy!

182
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,650
Gum-Gum...

183
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,700
...Jet Rocket!

184
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,910
Look! The shadows are coming out.

185
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,540
Gum-Gum...

186
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,880
...Jet Bazooka!

187
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,190
Jet Bazooka! Jet Bazooka!

188
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,170
Gobs of shadows are being released!

189
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,690
Why are the shadows leaving
if they're under his control?

190
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,480
Moria is losing control over them
as he starts to black out.

191
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,860
Even Moria can't fully control
a thousand shadows at once!

192
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,410
--Gum-Gum...
--Brick Bat!

193
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,130
Black Box!

194
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,090
I'm trapped!

195
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,010
I'm going to crush you!

196
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,550
That was a direct hit!

197
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,800
It was just like the punch
that put a crack in the island!

198
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,650
Straw Hat!

199
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,910
Stop it!

200
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,080
This is your baptism!

201
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,290
This is what happens when a whippersnapper

202
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,300
tries to act like a big shot on these waters!

203
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,810
This is what you get for defying
one of the Seven Warlords!

204
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,810
H-He's cruel!

205
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:51,310
Know your place! The world is devised
to crush anyone who stands out!

206
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,970
Luffy-san!

207
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,040
Luffy!

208
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,620
Luffy!

209
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,000
He got back up!

210
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,240
It doesn't matter if I'm
a "whippersnapper"...

211
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,330
...or if I stand out!

212
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,420
No one...

213
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,560
...can...

214
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,920
...crush me!

215
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,860
No one can crush you?

216
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,930
Your ability to say that
without any justification

217
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,640
proves just how green you are!

218
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,350
It's because I'm rubber.

219
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,790
In just a sec, I'm gonna make you
spew out all of the shadows!

220
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,530
What's with him? Is he immortal?

221
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,960
He's incredible!

222
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,000
The morning light!

223
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,330
Crap!

224
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,100
Stupid! Get in the shadows or you're toast!

225
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,880
Help me! My hand is vanishing.

226
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,210
Hurry into the shadows!
The courtyard isn't safe anymore.

227
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,140
Third Gear!

228
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,160
Bone Balloon!

229
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,400
Hey, is it wise to use that
attack more than once?

230
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,660
Of course not!

231
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't you remember what using
Second Gear did to you that one time?

232
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,750
Use your Gum-Gum to shoot yourself over here!

233
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,970
Once you're here, I'll carry you!

234
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,380
We're surrounded by the sea
and a bunch of battleships!

235
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,680
If we stay here, we're gonna be killed!

236
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,340
I-I can't...

237
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,900
What?

238
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,400
My body... isn't moving at all.

239
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,950
Don't be ridiculous! You defeated the enemy!

240
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,410
We got Robin back, too!
All that's left is for us to go back!

241
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,830
Please! Try hard!

242
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,710
This really is nuts, Luffy!

243
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,240
Your body can't take this!

244
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,460
Gum-Gum...

245
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,590
...Giant Jet Shell!

246
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,890
It's so powerful!

247
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,110
More shadows are coming out!

248
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,070
I won't let them escape! They're my minions!

249
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:13,050
Shadows, I am your sovereign!

250
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,260
That bastard! He doesn't
plan on giving up our shadows.

251
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,680
My shadow!

252
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,570
Come back to me!

253
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,940
--Captain Lola!
--Captain Lola!

254
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,100
Captain! Captain!

255
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,140
My shadow, can't you hear me?

256
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,680
We were always together,
clear from the time I was born!

257
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,280
We came into this world together!

258
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,400
Come back to me!

259
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,290
I spent the past three years searching
for the zombie that contained you!

260
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,350
Now you're in there, aren't you?

261
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,540
If you can hear me, come back! Come back!

262
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,970
Captain Lola!

263
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,880
Please hide in the shadows!

264
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,970
You're gonna turn to ash!

265
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,510
But... But it's killing me!

266
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,600
It's right there!

267
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,520
You're right! Supposedly all of our
shadows are currently inside of Moria.

268
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,970
They're right in front of us!

269
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,120
We'll never get another chance like this!

270
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,860
But we're up against one
of the Seven Warlords...

271
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,030
She's right... Come back!

272
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,740
Shadows, come back!

273
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,330
Come back!

274
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,000
Come back!!

275
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,960
Come back!

276
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,490
Come back! Come back! Come back!

277
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,090
I'd like to say something to my shadow, too.

278
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,520
If you want to become the
King of the Pirates...

279
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,190
...you had better...

280
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,300
...stick with me!

281
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,710
Straw Hat, curse you...!

282
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,660
I dare you to go to the New World!

283
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,820
The real nightmare awaits
you in the New World!

284
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,380
Our shadows are coming back!

285
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,730
We made it in time!

286
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,200
Here come our shadows!

287
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,640
H-Hey, guys!

288
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,680
Whoa!

289
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,290
Shadow, please hurry!

290
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,670
What the heck?!

291
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,750
No way!

292
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,950
Come on, guys!

293
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,990
W-Wait! What is going on?!

294
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,110
Didn't we take down Moria?!

295
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,480
Luffy!

296
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,670
It sounds like my fears were justified.

297
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,660
So it would seem.

298
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,040
Do not leave witnesses to testify
that Straw Hat defeated Moria.

299
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,620
I am assigning you to a special mission.

300
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,520
Annihilate the entire Straw Hat Crew!

301
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,000
That will be easy.

302
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,840
On the next episode of One Piece!

303
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,260
"Not Out of Danger Yet!
Orders to Annihilate the Straw Hat Crew!"

304
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
