2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,630
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,650
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,990
Luffy finally freed Ace!

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,240
However, Admiral Akainu landed
a fatal blow against Ace

63
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,000
and Ace died in Luffy's arms!

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,930
The man that Roger is waiting for...

65
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,090
...is not you, Teach, at any rate!

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,600
Forgive me, my sons.

67
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,100
I raised such a ridiculous fool.

68
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,150
You guys gave me everything.

69
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,820
I have deep appreciation.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Goodbye, my sons!

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,350
"The Show Begins! Blackbeard's
Plot is Revealed!"

72
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,170
Head Office! Head Office!

73
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,760
There's big news out of Marineford!

74
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Is it true?!

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,130
Is Whitebeard really...?! Are you sure?!

76
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,980
Can't believe that Whitebeard is...!

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,100
The news has spread around
the world like wildfire!

78
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,500
"The Whitebeards failed to
rescue Roger's son Ace!"

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,930
"And the death of Whitebeard,
the legendary pirate captain."

80
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,820
Extra! Get ready to issue an extra!

81
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,950
Here is the breaking news!

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,030
Whitebeard died shortly after
"Fire Fist" Ace! I repeat!

83
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,790
--At Marineford...
--Whitebeard is...

84
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,420
...Dead!

85
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,830
Then this is it for the Whitebeard Pirates!

86
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,680
--The war will be over soon!
--We can live in peace finally!

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,310
People who witnessed with their own eyes

88
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,250
the historic event which is being reported...

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,130
...stand transfixed, words
frozen on their lips.

90
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,910
So Whitebeard's gone now...

91
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,980
He was 72 years old.

92
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,550
He stood even against the King
of the Pirates in his day.

93
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,260
He was the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates

94
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,770
and was the great pirate Edward Newgate...

95
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,090
...aka Whitebeard.

96
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,770
He died in the decisive war at
the bay of Marineford between...

97
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,010
...the Whitebeard Pirates
and the Navy Headquarters

98
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,330
and their ally The Seven Warlords.

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,250
This is great!

100
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,380
Things are really gonna change in the world!

101
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,800
But even before that,

102
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,380
I don't think that things will
settle down that easily here!

103
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,260
With the most heinous criminals and
the jail manager of Impel Down,

104
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,640
I wonder what Blackbeard is up to.

105
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,640
What's gonna happen?

106
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,400
Is this really the end of the war?

107
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,610
Also, the thing that Whitebeard
said before he died...

108
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,190
The One Piece...

109
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,620
...is real!!

110
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,960
It's a matter of time before
the world finds out!

111
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,880
I wonder how the pirates will react!

112
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,170
But even before that, can we
say this war is really over?

113
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,880
Why did Blackbeard come to Marineford?

114
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,780
That bastard!

115
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,530
Marco! Everybody feels the same!

116
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,370
But you better hold your tongue for now!

117
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,560
I know, Vista!

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,830
Hurry up and get on the ship! Don't
you remember our captain's last order?

119
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,540
--Ace!
--Pops!

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,890
Jimbei! Bring Ace's brother, hurry!

121
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,100
Okay!

122
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,320
Ace-san! Good old man!

123
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,690
I couldn't do anything to help you two!

124
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,660
I want to help Luffy-kun at least!

125
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,240
--Don't let the pirates get away!
--Kill them all!

126
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,250
Captain Buggy, where're you going?!

127
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,920
Are you stupid?! I'm getting out of here!

128
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,670
I can't kill Whitebeard - he's already dead!

129
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,710
Captain Buggy!

130
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,590
I couldn't do it!

131
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,130
Black Hole!

132
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,220
--Captain Buggy, now is your chance!
--Hurry and kill Whitebeard!

133
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,770
I know that you can make it over the crack!

134
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,480
Stop telling me what to do! It
wouldn't be smart to just jump him!

135
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,190
I'm waiting for the right time!

136
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,650
--They think that it's easy!
--Vortex!

137
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,660
You can't create earthquakes anymore!

138
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,540
Oh yeah! Captain Buggy knew
it and waited for this moment!

139
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,000
--Let us help you!
--Oh no, wait...

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,340
--Here you go, Captain Buggy!
--Wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute, guys!

141
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,010
Ouch! Damn!

142
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,980
I-Is that what a dying
old man is capable of?!

143
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,820
N-No! That's what makes
him the legend Whitebeard!

144
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,680
I was scared and I couldn't
even approach him!

145
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,600
Whitebeard was scary!

146
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,330
The man at the top is
scary, even if he is dead!

147
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,040
I don't care if you think that I'm
hopeless! I say goodbye to you fools!

148
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,590
Captain Buggy!

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,510
He's crying... Captain Buggy...

150
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,890
I know why! "Yesterday's
enemy could be today's d!"

151
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,470
He felt pity for his rival Whitebeard
as a human without even noticing!

152
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,100
He could've killed that guy!

153
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,850
And now he's trying to leave
us  without making excuses!

154
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,940
Son of a gun! He showed us something

155
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,070
more important than killing Whitebeard!

156
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,030
I can't believe that he chose
to have pity on the instead of

157
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,000
all the fame he was surely going to get!

158
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,020
He is one man in a million
as we knew all along!

159
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,960
You're way too cool, Captain Buggy!

160
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,300
--Wait, Captain Buggy!
--Let us come with you!

161
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,280
Captain!

162
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,020
He was so tenacious! Good to
see him drop dead finally!

163
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,860
It's going as we planned so
far. Now is the time, Captain.

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,160
Alright, let's begin!

165
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,500
They're up to something again!

166
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,250
--Teach, that bastard!
--What is he gonna do to Pops now?!

167
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm gonna put on a show!

168
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,090
It's a show that will shake the whole world!

169
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,310
What is that black cloth?!

170
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,890
Blackbeard got inside of it
with the body of Whitebeard!

171
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,560
Now, please don't trespass for a while!

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,130
What do you think you're doing?!

173
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,450
He's someone who deceived us by joining
the Warlords only to betray us!

174
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,490
Stay alert!

175
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,280
I can't wait!

176
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,660
Are we gonna disband if we fail?

177
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,630
Hurry up! To the sea!

178
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,550
Luffy-kun!

179
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,160
Stay with me!

180
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,390
You have to carry on in this
world where Ace-san is no longer lives...

181
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,320
...tomorrow and the day after!

182
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,430
Fire!

183
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,600
You have to live strong!

184
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,940
Jimbei, if I don't escape death...

185
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,490
I'm sorry but could you
look after my brother?

186
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,290
I'm sorry to contradict you, Ace-san,

187
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,540
but you can't overrate me. I'm
not as good-natured as you think.

188
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,920
Even if he's your brother,
we're in the pirates' world.

189
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,220
I only help or protect the ones
who I have a high regard for!

190
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,440
My feelings haven't changed at all, Ace-san!

191
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm not helping him because
he is your brother!

192
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,280
I have a high regard for
Luffy-kun! That is why...!

193
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,300
Hurry up, Jimbei! Give Luffy treatment!

194
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,920
Pacifista! Kill Straw Hat!

195
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,000
Although he's a Warlord,
Jimbei is our enemy now!

196
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,490
We're allowed to kill him!

197
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,020
Perfume Femur!

198
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,270
Boa Hancock! Are you gonna
stand in our way again?!

199
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,410
"Fire Fist" Ace and Whitebeard
are dead already!

200
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,370
I don't like persistent men!

201
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,370
Jimbei! Please take good care of Luffy!

202
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,500
Jimbei! Get on this ship!

203
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,380
Okay!

204
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,960
What's this?!

205
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,600
--Damn! He froze the sea!
--We can't leave!

206
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,640
Hurry up and do something!

207
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,480
It's Admiral Aokiji!

208
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,060
Stop Aokiji!

209
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,980
I have no choice! I'll look for another way!

210
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,540
When I say that I won't let you get away,

211
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,250
why don't you give up your life, you fool!

212
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,400
Hand Dragon's son over to me!

213
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,700
--Akainu! He isn't dead!
--I thought he was beaten by Pops!

214
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,950
--He traveled underground...
--...By making a path with lava!

215
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,850
Jimbei!

216
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,880
I cannot do that! Because I've
already made up my mind...

217
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,130
...to save his life even if it means death!

218
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,010
Alright then, I won't ask you again!

219
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,850
Coby! Akainu-san wants to
kill Straw Hat at any cost!

220
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,690
Once he sees you as a target,
you can't get away from him!

221
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,060
Luffy-san...

222
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:55,160
--We're gonna protect Ace's brother!
--That's also what Pops wanted!

223
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,410
Yeah! Ace's family is our family, too!

224
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,830
"Family"? Don't be ridiculous!

225
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,620
You guys just left "Fire Fist" Ace

226
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,840
and your "father" Whitebeard
to their fate and ran!

227
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,210
--What did you say?!
--Take this!

228
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,850
I-It doesn't work at all!

229
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,100
Outta my way, you cowards!

230
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,310
Move aside, Jimbei!

231
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,110
Emporio Face Growth Synthesis!

232
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,860
Ivan-san, let me assist you!

233
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,950
Great Scissors!

234
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,750
Keep your hands off of Straw boy!

235
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,500
I'll kill Dragon's son for sure!

236
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,170
Hell...

237
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,750
...Wink!

238
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,000
Since Impel Down, Straw boy
has been under assault...

239
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,900
...physically and mentally and it's
pushing him beyond his capacity!

240
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,030
If I let something happen to him,
I wouldn't be able to face...

241
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,530
...my comrade Dragon for the rest of my life!

242
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,740
I agree!

243
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,740
I have no time to play
with you guys right now!

244
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,000
So back off, you two!

245
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,210
Bring it on!

246
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm burning way hotter than you right now!

247
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,730
Looks like he's all set now!

248
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,070
Let me see it already, Captain!

249
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,330
Alright, everybody, thank you for waiting!

250
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,300
It's the greatest show in the world

251
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,170
presented by Captain Teach
of the Blackbeard Pirates!

252
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,050
Please enjoy it!

253
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,560
B-Blackbeard!

254
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,560
What was he doing in there?!

255
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,300
Nothing has changed on Whitebeard's body!

256
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,480
And neither has Blackbeard's!

257
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,030
Navy!

258
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,110
I'll show you what I'm capable of!

259
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,170
We'll turn against each other again!

260
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,270
Black Hole!

261
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,090
What's going on?!

262
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,850
That's my Dark-Dark Fruit power!

263
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,390
And now...

264
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,190
...this is...!

265
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,400
That pose is...!

266
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,850
That's...

267
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,520
...the power of Tremor-Tremor Fruit!

268
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,650
W-Why does he possess the
late Whitebeard's power?!

269
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,530
You did it, Captain!

270
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,470
We're not gonna disband then?

271
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,290
It looks like I made the right
choice by teaming up with them!

272
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,880
Pops' tremor power?!

273
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,750
What did he do, that bastard Teach!

274
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,470
The gravity of darkness
brings total annihilation!

275
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,260
And the power of tremor destroys everything!

276
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,300
I possess them both! No one
can compete with me now!

277
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,230
I'm the strongest man in the world!

278
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,730
I don't know how he did it but...

279
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,460
he acquired Whitebeard's power!

280
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,220
How is it possible?!

281
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,330
That means we still have to fear
the power of Tremor-Tremor Fruit?!

282
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,160
If I'm correct, it's impossible to have
two Devil Fruit powers at the same time!

283
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,340
It's impossible for average
people, that's for sure.

284
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,570
But Teach is a little
different, as you guys know.

285
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,310
His body structure is irregular
compared to common people's.

286
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,980
That's why he was able to do it!

287
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,850
Hey, did you guys see that?!

288
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,320
Tell all the people in the world!
The boring people who love peace,

289
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,740
Navy soldiers, the World
Government, and pirates!

290
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,530
This must be a bad dream!

291
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,870
The future of this world is determined!

292
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,630
Yes, here comes the era that I conquer!

293
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,180
I thought that Whitebeard
died and the Navy won!

294
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,600
I can't believe that he now
has two Devil Fruit powers!

295
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,020
Who the hell is Blackbeard?!

296
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,350
I thought that the war would be over soon!

297
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,770
Then why is this happening?! Hey, Coby!

298
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:11,160
Although Luffy-san's brother and Whitebeard
died, this war is still not over?!

299
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,210
Blackbeard freely uses the power he
stole from Whitebeard to wreak havoc.

300
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,970
Meanwhile, Akainu and the rest of the Navy

301
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,880
chase down the pirates
in the name of justice.

302
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,510
The battle shows no sign of coming to an end,

303
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,690
but only increases in intensity!

304
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,890
On the next episode of One Piece!

305
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,480
"The Insatiable Akainu!
Lava Fists Pummel Luffy!"

306
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
