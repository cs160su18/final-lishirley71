00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,680
"The Fabled Pirate Hunter!
Zoro, the Wandering Swordsman"

20
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,720
We're going to drink up
every bit of liquor in this joint!

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,010
Hey, now, Billy,

22
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,120
how many places are you going
to ruin before you're satisfied?

23
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,670
How should I know?

24
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,590
"Yosaku (several years ago)"

25
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,740
That man over there...

26
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,440
has a bounty of 5,000,000 Berries.

27
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,960
5,000,000? What do you say...

28
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,320
"Johnny (several years ago)"

29
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,320
we back off on this one, Yosaku?

30
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,790
Hey, Johnny,

31
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,510
if all we do is go after
small-timers, we won't get anywhere.

32
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,070
This is the time when a bounty hunter
has to go after the higher ranks.

33
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,460
I know what you're saying,
but when it comes to 5,000,000,

34
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,290
even we would lose by a hair.

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,900
Give me something to eat.

36
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,050
Got any money?

37
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,580
Not right now. However,

38
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,030
I'll be making some soon enough,
once I cut me up a bounty.

39
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,120
I can't let that go unanswered!

40
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,790
I'll cut you down before you can get me!

41
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,030
Don't go making me exert myself so much.

42
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,350
I'm hungry.

43
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,480
Answer me one thing:
Is there a bounty on your head?

44
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,560
Won't you be surprised to hear?

45
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,630
I've got a bounty of 5,000,000 Berries!

46
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,480
You don't say. That's plenty.

47
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,280
What?

48
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,540
I've earned some money.
Now give me something to eat.

49
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,210
Yes, coming right up!

50
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,050
He's got amazing skill.

51
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,680
He's not on the wanted list.

52
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,010
If he's a bounty hunter,
someone should know who he is.

53
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,210
Could he be the pirate hunter
we've heard about lately?

54
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,560
I've heard he's one incredibly brutal guy.

55
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,790
No, word is that the pirate
hunter uses three swords.

56
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,980
They say that one of them is a
famous sword, with a white sheath.

57
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,380
What's more, they say
he's like a demon beast,

58
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,410
who's taken the form of a man.

59
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,680
He sure doesn't look like that.

60
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,370
If that's the case...

61
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,730
...we can't just stand by
as our prey is taken from us!

62
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,830
Hey, Johnny...

63
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,730
Hey, mister, if you're a bounty hunter, too,

64
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,390
then you have to abide by our rules.

65
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,510
Huh?

66
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,270
We didn't want to make
any trouble for the pub,

67
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,260
so we were waiting for him to leave.

68
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,730
We had first dibs on this guy.
He was our prey.

69
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,350
H-Hey, you!

70
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,480
Didn't you hear me?!

71
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
There are rules among
fellow bounty hunters!

72
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,950
Hawk-Eye.

73
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,750
Do you know Hawk-Eye Mihawk?

74
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,410
Mihawk? One of the Seven Warlords?

75
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,220
I'm on a journey,
with the aim of defeating him,

76
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,700
and becoming the world's
greatest swordsmaster.

77
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,210
I do collect bounties, in order to eat,

78
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,920
but it's not as though I'm a bounty hunter.

79
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,940
The world's greatest swordsmaster?

80
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,270
Hey, did you hear that, partner?

81
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,770
No way! There's no way!
You must be dreaming!

82
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,190
When I was a kid, that's what
I made up my mind to do.

83
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,550
It doesn't matter what anyone else says.

84
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,050
Even if it was your childhood
dream, there's no way you'll...

85
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,960
I didn't know you had claim on him. Sorry.

86
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,370
You can deliver him to the navy.

87
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,620
The bounty is yours.

88
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,570
Y-You mean it?!

89
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,990
However...

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,220
...my lunch here is on you.

91
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,800
We did it, Johnny! 5,000,000 Berries!

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,200
We'll be able to eat for a while,
without having to go after any bounties.

93
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,720
Hey, what's the matter?

94
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,320
Aren't you happy?

95
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,790
Why...

96
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,180
...did you become a bounty hunter?

97
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,080
Huh? Why did I?

98
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,980
Isn't it obvious? So I could eat.

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,800
The village where I was born
was really poor.

100
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,280
Even so, the bandits still
hit villages like mine a lot.

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,930
When they did, the bounty
hunters who were after

102
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,750
the bandits' heads came, too.

103
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,030
Deep down in my heart, I wanted
to be just like those dashing men,

104
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,450
who challenged the bandits to fight.

105
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,300
I thought to myself, someday,

106
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,680
I sure do hope that I can take
down those bad men like that, too.

107
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,180
It wasn't until much later that I learned

108
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,650
that they collected bounties
as their profession.

109
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,330
Now that you mention it,
I wanted to be like them, too.

110
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,270
When I heard what that
"world's greatest" dude in there said,

111
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,860
it reminded me of myself back then.

112
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,820
Hey, what are you getting
all sentimental on me for?

113
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,200
It's not like you.

114
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,370
Shut up.

115
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,710
What is it?!

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,820
What's wrong? Has something happened?

117
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,420
Bandits! The Dick Gang is attacking
a ranch just outside of town!

118
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,610
Dick the Bandit?

119
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
Here he is! Wow!

120
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,640
He's a big-leaguer-- 10,000,000 Berries!

121
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,850
Snap it up, men!

122
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,770
They were hiding quite a bit, huh?

123
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,630
We got a big haul today!

124
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,470
Is that them?

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,870
Hey, what do we do?
They're taking it all away, fast!

126
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,290
We're talking about the bandit Dick.
We're no match for him.

127
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,420
It's not worth it if he takes
our lives from us, too.

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,670
Damn it!

129
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,020
All right, next one!
Take everything they've got!

130
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,850
What's with the people in this town?

131
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,610
They're such cowards.

132
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,180
Don't they even have
the guts to put up a fight?

133
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,270
Well, maybe that's smart, in a certain sense.

134
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,740
There are those who take,
and those who get taken from,

135
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,440
and you're either one or
the other in this day and age.

136
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,210
Being weak is a crime all by itself.

137
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,710
Defiance is something only a fool would do!

138
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,010
So there is a fool here...

139
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,430
G-Give back our food!

140
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,510
That's something we all
worked very hard to store up!

141
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,490
Harry!

142
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,180
You've got grown-up guts, at least.

143
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,570
Darn you...!

144
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,360
Harry! Stop! You're no match for him!

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,480
Harry!

146
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,520
Let's go!

147
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,160
Hey, take it easy, partner.
Even we would lose to him by a hair.

148
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,160
That's not why. He's...

149
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,360
...who I was that day...

150
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,170
He doesn't know how to compromise
or look out for himself yet.

151
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,020
He's me, back when I was still innocent.

152
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,190
Hey! Johnny!

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,430
What do you think you're doing?!

154
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,490
Who are you?!

155
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,320
Just a nameless bounty hunter.

156
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,900
What did you say?

157
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,660
You guys are bounty hunters, huh?

158
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,390
Are you after my head?

159
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,700
What a pain. You're just a couple of hyenas.

160
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,100
What did you call us?!

161
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,940
If you want money, then I
can give you some charity,

162
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,780
if you don't mind small change.

163
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,530
We don't want it!

164
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,320
Huh?

165
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,350
We just feel a little bit like
being champions of justice today.

166
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,850
Eh? Hey, Johnny...

167
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,250
Champions of justice?

168
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,600
Hey...

169
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,300
Partner...

170
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
Would you let me be a man?

171
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,560
Johnny...

172
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,410
Johnny, you mean...?

173
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,230
All right.

174
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,100
There's no such thing as
justice or evil in this day and age!

175
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,450
The mighty prevail!
That's all there is to it, am I right?

176
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,600
We're serious!

177
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah! Just this morning,

178
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,620
we turned in a bounty worth
5,000,000 Berries to the navy!

179
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,210
The navy, this morning?

180
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,800
You're the ones who did in Billy--
my sworn brother?!

181
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,970
What?!

182
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,470
Have you finished the
sword I asked you to do?

183
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,840
Yeah.

184
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,150
You have exceptional skill.

185
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,960
I put in a lot of work.

186
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,710
You're too reckless with
such a precious sword.

187
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,720
If that were an ordinary sword,
it would have met the same fate

188
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,480
as those two other broken swords of yours.

189
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,280
All right. I'll be careful.

190
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,170
I'm going to get stronger for her, too!

191
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,210
I'm going to get strong enough
that my name reaches to heaven!

192
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,020
I'm going to be the world's
strongest swordsman!

193
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,690
Thanks for your help. I'd like
to pay you something extra,

194
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,990
but unfortunately, right now, I'm broke.

195
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,590
Don't worry about it.

196
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,070
It's not often I get to see
such an item as that.

197
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,930
It was a feast for the eyes.

198
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,240
Not at all like this
good-for-nothing long sword.

199
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,640
Hey, didn't I tell you so?!

200
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,790
Give me a break!

201
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,700
No matter how many swords you carry,
it'll never be enough like this!

202
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,950
Damn, I've done it again.

203
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,380
Sorry, I'll be sure to make it up to you.

204
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,580
That's that punk Dick, the mountain whale.

205
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,300
He's a 10,000,000-Berry bandit,
who uses a cannon.

206
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,200
A bandit with a price on his head, huh?

207
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,740
Damn it!

208
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,260
It's no use. He's too much
for those guys, after all.

209
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,600
What is this?

210
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,590
Are you two really the ones
who took out my sworn brother?

211
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,750
Hmph! We were the ones who turned in Billy,

212
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,020
but someone else beat him, you bastard!

213
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
Then what are you bragging for?

214
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,230
I thought you were pretty weak.

215
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,690
Shut up!

216
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,670
Man, you are relentless.

217
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,380
Stop!

218
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,210
Hey!

219
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,830
Why, you...!

220
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,920
You want to die that badly, do you?!

221
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,350
Boss!

222
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,220
We're done loading
all the loot into the cart.

223
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,080
You're done? Then let's pull out of here.

224
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,860
There's no sense in messing
around with these weaklings.

225
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,960
Hold on!

226
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,900
I said hold it right there, wanted man!

227
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,680
We've turned in dozens--
no, hundreds of bounties by a hair!

228
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,120
If we let you get away,

229
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,330
it will shame us for generations to come!

230
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,860
What a waste.

231
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,720
It's not worth it, is it?

232
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,220
Maybe we won't earn anything... but still...

233
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,940
...there are times when a man
has to stick to his beliefs, and fight!

234
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,770
You guys aren't long for this life.

235
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,880
We knew that when we started!

236
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,620
I see.

237
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,840
Hey, men! Take care of
these guys, right away!

238
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,460
Let 'em have it!

239
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,210
Out of the way!

240
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,760
What do you want?! Let me go!
They're in there fighting for me!

241
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,730
If you feel like fighting...

242
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,600
...think. What can you do
with the power you've got?

243
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,560
My, my, you poor guys.

244
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,530
You don't have a spot on your
faces that hasn't been messed up.

245
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,950
I think it's about time to put an end to this.

246
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,110
It won't gain me a single
red cent to kill the two of you,

247
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,300
but consider this your own twist of fate.

248
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,380
The hard luck that comes from
having come after my head.

249
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,510
But relax, I'll send you into
the next world together, as pals.

250
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Take this!

251
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,570
Here goes!

252
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,890
That's enough, don't you think?

253
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,050
This fight was over a long time ago.

254
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,540
You...

255
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,510
That guy from earlier...

256
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,720
Forgive me, but I'm going
to swipe your prey from you.

257
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,530
I've come into an urgent
need of money, you see.

258
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,850
S-Sure...

259
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,380
Okay.

260
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,430
Who is that?

261
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,600
A-A white-sheathed sword...?

262
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,530
I need to borrow your swords for a minute.

263
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,630
No problem, but what exactly are you--

264
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,250
Three swords?! You don't mean...!

265
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
The pirate hunter, Roronoa Zoro?!

266
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,680
Ho, so this is the fabled pirate hunter, huh?

267
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,660
So then, what's going on here?

268
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,200
Sure, I've gotten noticeably stronger lately,

269
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,750
but as soon as I use too
much of it, my swords break.

270
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,110
I can't go overusing my strength so recklessly.

271
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,980
No matter the sword,
I have to get to the point

272
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,500
where I'm able to get
100% of its force out of it.

273
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,260
Roronoa Zoro-san, even using three swords,

274
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,520
I don't think you'll be able to
defeat that many men at once.

275
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,170
Using three swords is not the same thing

276
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,410
as using the Three-Sword Style.

277
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,430
Three-Sword Style, you say?

278
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,370
Let's see it, why don't we?

279
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,880
Get him, men!

280
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,570
He did it! Incredible!

281
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,050
Outstanding!

282
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,100
Watch out!

283
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,230
Awesome!

284
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,180
I told you, don't stand beside me.

285
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,580
You're going to catch
a cold dressed like that.

286
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,840
People who catch colds are people
who let their mind's guard down.

287
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,260
Well, I wonder if someone
somewhere is spreading stories

288
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,450
about Zoro, the pirate hunter.

289
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,410
I've never once called myself a pirate hunter.

290
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,360
Then, who did give you
a name as cool as that?

291
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,370
Who knows? It doesn't matter to me.

292
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,130
O-Oh, crap! My flame!

293
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,300
Oni Giri!!

294
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,610
So that... is the Three-Sword Style...

295
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,370
All right, they aren't broken.

296
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,160
Thanks for the help.

297
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,900
Roronoa Zoro!

298
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,930
I'm deeply impressed by your skill.
Would you let us join you?

299
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,280
We are a bounty hunting unit,

300
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,620
fearsome enough by a hair
to silence a crying child,

301
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,130
Yosaku and Johnny.

302
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,840
Suit yourselves.

303
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
Big Bro!

304
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,690
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

305
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:28,280
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

306
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:43,590
There are days where I almost lose to myself

307
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:50,590
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

308
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:58,080
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

309
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:09,080
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

310
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:17,390
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

311
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,240
This unique moment...

312
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,010
--Hey, Luffy...
--Huh?

313
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,460
Let's hurry and get off this island.

314
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,630
It looks like there's going to
be nothing but trouble here.

315
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,680
I get the same whiff from that
old-timer that I do from you.

316
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,730
Really? Then there's nothing
to worry about, is there?

317
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,350
No, that's why I'm worried!

318
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,340
Oh, yeah?
