00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,870
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,770
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,240
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,380
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,410
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,870
Those ranked Lieutenant
Commander or below, stay put!

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,980
To the two hundred elite Captains and
Commanders, go take them out quickly!

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,020
Get them!

37
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,990
Recapture Nico Robin!

38
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm part of the Straw Hats, too.
When we fight, we fight together.

39
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,130
Hold strong until Luffy comes!

40
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,390
I'll pursue that woman who threatens
the World Government's plans

41
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,680
to the very ends of the
earth and eliminate her...

42
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,140
...in the name of dark justice!

43
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,610
We came to take Robin away from all that!

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,860
Jet Stamp!

45
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,110
Six King Gun!

46
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,800
Luffy!

47
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,840
--I got him!
--Watch out!

48
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,050
Hey! Now's not the time
to be spacing out, Soge...

49
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,910
Luffy!

50
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,370
What're you doing?!

51
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,330
Get up!

52
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,560
Luffy!

53
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,670
"Fists Full of Emotion!
Luffy Unleashes Gatling with All His Might"

54
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,100
Weapons Left!

55
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,740
Super...!

56
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,070
Commander!

57
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,580
What's with those pirates?!

58
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,040
What a crazy brawl! They're holding
their own against Captains!

59
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,800
Is that woman a power holder?!

60
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,510
I'll take care of her. Stay back!

61
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,180
Cien Fleurs!

62
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,060
Flip!

63
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,030
Here we go! Thunder Ball!

64
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,410
Thunderbolt Tempo!

65
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,040
Done!

66
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,430
So I guess these guys aren't
the typical small fries, huh?

67
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,850
Two-Sword Style...

68
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,320
...Hawk Wave!

69
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,160
Who's next?!

70
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,460
Usopp...

71
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,380
Luffy!

72
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,310
Luffy!

73
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,400
Luffy!

74
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,330
Get up!

75
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,160
U-Usopp...

76
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,500
S-So... you came?

77
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,760
D-Don't get the wrong idea!

78
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,230
I came here to rescue Robin!

79
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,920
I didn't come here to see your face!

80
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,550
Geez... He's such a...

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,080
Hey, you! Boss cat of CP9!

82
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,380
I'm talking to you!
Now, I'll take you on! Bring it on!

83
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,260
Th-That's right! I'm your opponent!

84
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,490
Now, don't be surprised when I tell you this!

85
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm the great Captain Usopp,
a pirate among pirates,

86
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,110
the great warrior of the sea who
has 8,000 men under his command!

87
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,790
I've traveled all over the Grand Line
and wreaked havoc on every single island!

88
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,120
Anyone who falls into my hands...

89
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,080
...even you guys, the World Government...

90
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,310
...will be crushed by the tip of my little finger!

91
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,890
If that pisses you off, then bring it on!
You no-good little kitten!

92
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,230
Hey...

93
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,960
Hey... don't! Don't! Hey!

94
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,190
Leave him alone!

95
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,870
You've already lost.
I have no business with you.

96
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,430
They're all gonna be killed anyway.

97
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,160
You just stay there and watch.

98
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,420
All right, come on, boss cat!
I'm gonna blow you away!

99
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Are you stupid?! Stop it, Usopp! He'll kill you!

100
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,270
Shut up! What can you do
when you're almost dead?!

101
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,160
He's mine! I'm gonna beat him up!

102
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,580
Then get up already!

103
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,340
Then don't look like you're about to die!

104
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,280
It's not like you!

105
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,630
Even though there's nothing but smoke
above us, we can still see the sky!

106
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,210
We can see the sea, too!

107
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,490
This isn't... This isn't hell!

108
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,940
Don't look like you're about to die, you jerk!

109
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,310
Don't make us worry, you bastard!

110
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,630
Are you done?

111
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,380
You'd better be prepared.

112
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,340
I know...

113
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,110
This isn't hell or anything.

114
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,270
Luffy...!

115
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,200
Defeat him! We'll all go back together, Luffy!

116
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,160
Of course!

117
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,830
So you can still move...

118
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,310
I never said... I gave in.

119
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,590
Until I defeat you...

120
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,560
...I won't... sink to the ground ever again!

121
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,380
I'm terminating Life Return.

122
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,760
I've had enough with you guys' farce.

123
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,950
I'll crush you with pure power once and for all!

124
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,910
Don't worry about your friends, Straw Hat.

125
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,170
As you wish... to be together with them again...

126
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,130
...I'll send you all to the same hell!

127
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,520
Spots!

128
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,200
They've given us quite a bit of trouble!

129
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,260
If we're just careful about that thunderbolt...

130
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,470
Ahhh! There's another cloud!

131
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,200
Guys, don't gather in one place!
Spread out and attack all at...

132
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,430
What is it, at a time like this?!

133
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,570
What'd you do that for?!

134
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,150
--Guys!
--Hm?!

135
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,780
When the lightning strikes,
please be careful not to get electrocuted!

136
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,860
Thunder Ball!

137
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,200
Thunderbolt Tempo!

138
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,940
Good job, pirate ladies!

139
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:47,720
We're okay, so go up there
and help the guys already!

140
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,130
Leave the raccoon dog guy to us!

141
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,100
I'm not a raccoon dog. I'm a reindeer.

142
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,340
Okay! Then we'll leave Chopper to you!

143
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,610
--Robin!
--Yeah.

144
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,120
When everyone's fighting so hard,
to think that I can't do anything...

145
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,720
It's frustrating...!

146
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,700
Everyone! Hang in there!

147
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,170
H-Hey! What do you mean run away?!

148
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,810
It's our duty to guard this place!

149
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,840
This isn't the time for that!
This island will be entirely eliminated!

150
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,620
Click. Beep...

151
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,590
--Beep... beep... beep...
--Dammit!

152
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,820
Bingo!

153
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,870
Luffy...

154
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,560
Victory Bird!

155
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,230
Dammit! What's the deal
with them?! I can't hit them!

156
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,330
Hey! I beat them!

157
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,790
Oh, I see! All my shots
must've actually hit them!

158
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,010
That's right! I'm the king of snipers, Sogeking!

159
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,970
♪ I was born on the... ♪

160
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,670
Take this!

161
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,060
I'll show you the power of the Berry-Berry Fruit!

162
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,400
Dammit! I can't make a wrong move here!

163
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,730
You can't do anything, can you?!

164
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,910
Thanks!

165
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,790
Hey you, hold on a sec.

166
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,750
If you like flying so much...

167
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,010
Hey! D-Don't!

168
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,920
Weapons Left!

169
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,050
Be careful! There are some
power holders among them!

170
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,680
They could say the same about us!

171
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,230
Treinta Fleurs! Clutch!

172
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,780
So you're Roronoa Zoro?

173
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,820
And if I am?

174
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,410
I'll defeat you!

175
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,530
Fine!

176
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,670
I ate the Rust-Rust Fruit and became a rust man.

177
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,750
You can't defeat me.

178
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,220
Dammit! My Yubashiri...

179
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,600
I'll turn all your proud swords to rust.

180
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,180
Interesting...

181
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,600
I'll test you.

182
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,220
Now you get it, right?
You can't defeat me with swords!

183
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,490
I... I can't move my body!

184
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,900
I rusted your joint. I'll continue
until your entire body is rusted!

185
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,920
Dammit!

186
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,000
Firebird Star!

187
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,840
Are you okay, Zoro-kun?!

188
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,560
Gum-Gum... Jet Pistol!

189
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,660
Gum-Gum... Jet Pistol!

190
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm not gonna take that a second time!

191
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,500
Ultimate Radius...

192
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,750
Six King Gun!

193
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,260
Until I defeat you...

194
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,100
...I won't... sink to the ground ever again!

195
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,910
In the not-so-distant future, you'll regret
that you took in a troublesome woman.

196
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,370
Gum-Gum...

197
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,170
Yes, we are. I'll never see you guys again.

198
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,880
It's not a matter that people
like you can get involved in.

199
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,590
Robin intends to die for us!

200
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,640
Iron Body!

201
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,470
Are you insane?! Don't think
that you'll be able to survive

202
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,440
after making the entire world your enemy!

203
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,230
I'll pursue that woman to the very
ends of the earth and eliminate her...

204
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,900
I want to live!

205
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,410
...Jet...

206
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,390
...Gatling!

207
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,430
What's going on?!

208
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,460
What happened?!

209
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,340
Luffy!

210
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,130
Luffy...!

211
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,090
The first column is...!

212
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,410
H-Hey... What's that?

213
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,270
Hey! Look over there!

214
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,130
Th-This is a report to all ships.

215
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,690
This is a report to all ships!

216
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,860
Mr. Rob Lucci of CP9 has just...

217
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:50,560
Has just been defeated...
by pirate Straw Hat Luffy!

218
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,500
Luffy...

219
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,410
It's over...

220
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,550
We'll be okay now.

221
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,850
We're gonna go back together!

222
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,360
Robin!

223
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,140
So you came... You're such a... You're such a...

224
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,680
Luffy! Into the sea! Jump into the sea!

225
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,810
We've got one more friend, right?!

226
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

227
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,000
"From the Sea, a Friend Arrives!
The Straw Hats Share the Strongest Bond"

228
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,260
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
