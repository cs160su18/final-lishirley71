2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,860
My name is...

48
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,680
...Monkey D. Luffy!

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,980
Gum-Gum...

50
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,050
...Rifle!

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,410
What?!

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,080
I am the one and only Luffy!

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,780
Gum-Gum...

54
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,510
...Storm!

55
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,520
This isn't a dream, is it?

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,920
He won, didn't he?

57
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,320
He did! The Star of Hope won!

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,920
He defeated Oars and Moria!

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,640
Everyone will get their shadows back!

60
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:56,590
Thriller Bark has fallen!

61
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,470
"The End of the Battle Is Nigh!
Pound in the Finishing Move!"

62
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,120
You're incredible, Straw Hat!

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,220
He took out Oars!

64
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,510
Hey, Luffy! Hang in there!

65
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,430
--Luffy!
--Luffy, get up!

66
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,690
It's not my place to ask after
pushing him, but will he be okay?

67
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,660
I bet his body is absolutely exhausted.

68
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,910
He single-handedly wielded
the power of a hundred men.

69
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,860
Anyway, we need to recover all of
the shadows as quickly as possible!

70
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
Right! Let's hurry.

71
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,670
The eastern sky is starting
to get dangerously bright!

72
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,800
Dawn is on the horizon.

73
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,450
So how do you get your shadows back?

74
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,600
Four of my crewmates have lost theirs!

75
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm sure this has been
a trying ordeal for you.

76
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,480
Really, I'd like Straw Hat
to recover them for us.

77
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,640
Forget it! I bet he can't move a muscle.

78
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,780
Moria reigns over the shadows
in all of the zombies.

79
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,940
Unless he personally says,
"Return to your original master,"

80
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,160
our shadows won't come back.

81
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,450
Let's stop worrying and get to business.

82
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,590
Right! We'll just have to wake
Moria up and force him to say that.

83
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,970
What was the point in defeating him
if we don't reclaim our shadows?

84
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,520
O-Oars is back on his feet!

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,960
He shouldn't be able to move
after taking a beating like that!

86
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,610
This is horrible! We're screwed.

87
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,170
The Straw Hat Crew can't fight anymore!

88
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,760
And we used up our trump card, the shadows!

89
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,850
We don't have enough strength
left to level this monster!

90
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,850
That didn't hurt at all.

91
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,890
Damn it!

92
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,350
You really can't defeat a zombie
in a contest of strength.

93
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,600
We've reached our limit.
The sun is going to rise any minute now.

94
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,280
We'll never be free from this
life trapped in the darkness!

95
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,980
Let's give up. If we stay here,
we're just gonna die.

96
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,870
Let's hurry back to the forest.

97
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,840
Let's return... to the dark forest,
where the sun never shines.

98
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,760
Aren't you...?

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,260
I don't know what happened to Luffy,
but he dealt plenty of damage.

100
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,640
H-Hey, mister! You'll croak if you
try to run around as you are now.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,590
You can still stand after taking
a blow from that massive giant?

102
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,940
You're almost as immortal as the zombies!

103
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,820
Hey, where are the members of the
Straw Hat Crew that we moved over here?

104
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,950
B-Beats me! How could they
move when they're out cold?

105
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,110
Huh? What happened to
the two that were here?

106
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,540
You're right! The long-nosed guy
and the lady are gone.

107
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,620
You don't think...
they bailed out on us, do you?

108
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Eh?! When did they run off?

109
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,590
Anyway, this looks bad!
Let's split this scene.

110
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,800
So that... didn't quite cut it!

111
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,020
Huh? Straw Hat?!

112
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,220
Aw, man! Not you too, Straw Hat!

113
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,140
Just one more attack... Damn it!

114
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,400
That really took a lot outta me.

115
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,640
--Robin!
--Yes, I'm here.

116
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,540
She didn't hightail it!

117
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,650
I want up!

118
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,050
Roger.

119
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,420
I'll provide the footing.

120
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,910
If there is anything I could do for you...

121
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,460
Even the skeleton is up and moving!

122
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,260
What?! Why?

123
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,390
Great! Brook, I have a favor to ask of you.

124
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,130
I figured as much.

125
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,010
Everyone has taken positions
to offer support.

126
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,860
What is that lady doing way up there?!

127
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,360
I-It never even occurred
to these guys to run!

128
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,190
The moment Oars stood up...

129
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,440
...they started to prepare
for a counterattack!

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,180
Just you watch.

131
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,340
Chopper, hurry! The sun is rising.

132
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,020
Yeah!

133
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,480
Think you can use this, Franky?

134
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,910
That'll be great! Come lend me a hand!

135
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,200
I can't believe it!

136
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,320
These guys haven't given up at all!

137
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,040
Hey, you're in the way! Clear the area!

138
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,040
It would be our pleasure!

139
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,420
Pierna Fleurs!

140
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,500
Here we go!

141
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,180
Thanks!

142
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,440
Wait! Where are you going?

143
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,400
What is this? Smoke? Clouds?

144
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,870
The weather forecast is rain!

145
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,990
Cool Ball!

146
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,190
Rain Tempo!

147
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,450
Wha--?!

148
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,070
It's raining! But why?

149
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,210
Can that lady use magic?

150
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,550
All right! The emergency
plumbing job is done.

151
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,180
Jeez! I'm sopping wet.

152
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,460
Coup de Vent!

153
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,270
What was that?

154
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,600
Crank it like mad!

155
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,980
I'm cranking it!

156
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,410
Here it comes! It's the Super Cold Cannon
connected to the extra-large freezer!

157
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,400
Fire!

158
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,870
I'm frozen!

159
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,300
I can't move.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,580
Incredible!

161
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,220
The cold air froze him.

162
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,610
Now it's my turn!

163
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,490
Darn it!

164
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,830
Go!

165
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,580
Not a chain!

166
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,870
It worked!

167
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,550
Darn rudder chain!

168
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,340
You're amazing, Sanji!

169
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
Thanks!

170
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,860
Throw me!

171
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,640
I'm really going to throw you.

172
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,540
I'll be fine! I'm a rubber man!

173
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,950
Be careful.

174
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,360
Third Gear!

175
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,060
Bone Balloon!

176
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,460
Zoro, push in Oars' stomach.

177
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm on it.

178
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,420
Three-Sword Style...

179
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,380
...Secret Technique!

180
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,700
Three Thousand Worlds!

181
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,320
Wha--?!

182
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,360
Now's our chance.

183
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,110
Here goes nothing.

184
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,940
Looking good, Sanji!
Oars' back is perfectly straight.

185
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,700
What the heck are they doing?

186
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,360
A human spine normally bends in an S-shape

187
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,250
to soften the impact
and weight that goes on it.

188
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,120
But if you straighten it out,
it won't be able to disperse the shock.

189
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
It will take all of the damage!

190
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,840
Go, Luffy!

191
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,520
Good luck.

192
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,530
Eat my extra-large bazooka!

193
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,300
I'll repel it with a bazooka of my own!

194
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,990
Gum-Gum... Huh?

195
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,270
It won't move! I can't move my right arm!

196
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,030
It won't extend, either.

197
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,280
The zombies' shortcoming is
their inability to perceive damage.

198
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,000
That's your shadow. Settle the score, Luffy.

199
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,590
Gum-Gum...

200
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,280
Go!

201
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,750
Get him, Straw Hat!

202
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,350
Whatcha think of that?

203
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,590
...Giant...

204
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,220
...Bazooka!

205
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,960
He did it!

206
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,650
Even a zombie can't get up again
after a beating like that.

207
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,740
He lost...

208
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,570
Oars truly lost this time.

209
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,250
Now what will become of Thriller Bark?

210
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm amazed they pulled it off.

211
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,010
They're something else.

212
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,070
We certainly invited a
fearsome crew onto our ship!

213
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,370
What happened to the master?

214
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,800
They won! This time, they
really pulled it off!

215
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,210
They won!

216
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,600
--They really won!
--Thank you! You guys are the best!

217
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,830
You really were the Star of Hope!

218
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,510
You were everything we
hoped you'd be, Straw Hat!

219
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,170
You're tiny!

220
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,350
Who are you?!

221
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,010
Why did you shrink?!

222
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,070
Even though it doesn't hurt, I can't move.

223
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,530
I can't believe he's still ticking
even after we crushed his bones.

224
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,950
His vitality is making a mockery of life!

225
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,890
The morning light!

226
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,000
I wonder why... I have shivers
running down my spine.

227
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,970
Yay! He did it!

228
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,270
Hurray!

229
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,060
He won!

230
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,280
Hey, Luffy! Hurry and get
everyone's shadows back.

231
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,480
This is no time for partying.

232
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,900
All of you are toast without them!

233
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,160
Our shadows...!
You're right. We need to hurry.

234
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,540
Now go smack Moria awake
and make him return our shadows.

235
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,690
The sun is almost up!

236
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,050
I don't need... a wakeup call.

237
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,140
Moria!

238
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,720
Master!

239
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,130
I'm so glad you're all right!

240
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,440
There is no way Moria-sama could lose!

241
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,730
I-If you're up, that works just fine for us.

242
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,040
Now, if you don't want Straw Hat
to kick your butt again,

243
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,030
you'd better return all of our shadows!

244
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,180
Right! Give them back, jerk!

245
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,870
This isn't a schoolyard fight.

246
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,730
Even the threat of death is
meaningless before a true pirate.

247
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,130
I'm able to solve the mystery behind
Straw Hat's excessive level-up

248
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,190
if you "whipped dogs of
the forest" were involved.

249
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,400
How vile of you to use my
shadow ability against me!

250
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,700
Stuff it! Give our shadows back!

251
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,520
Straw Hat, how dare you...

252
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,410
...trash my Thriller Bark
like there is no tomorrow?!

253
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,960
That's what you get for
interfering with our voyage!

254
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,820
Now give back our shadows
before the sun comes up!

255
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,540
At your current strength, you would
have died if you continued your journey.

256
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,060
You're nowhere near strong
enough to face the New World!

257
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,890
You seem to have a pretty decent crew...

258
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,380
...but you'd lose all of them.

259
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,140
Do you know why?

260
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,200
Hey, Straw Hat! You don't have time to chat!

261
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,390
Look at the sky! It's getting so bright.

262
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,160
Please get our shadows back already!

263
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,450
We're running out of time!

264
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,670
I found the answer
through personal experience.

265
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,340
Why did I lose such infamous
and skilled subordinates?

266
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,540
I lost my crew because they were alive!

267
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,840
But with undead zombies,
I have nothing to lose!

268
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,470
Zombies are immortal!

269
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,950
They are unlimited soldiers that can
be replaced if someone purifies them.

270
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:09,110
With my army of the dead, I shall fight
to become King of the Pirates once more!

271
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,710
Consider yourselves fortunate that your
shadows get to serve as my subordinates.

272
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,550
It stuck to me!

273
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,510
Come to me, all of the
shadows on Thriller Bark!

274
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,180
Serve as my power!

275
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,660
Shadows Asgard!

276
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,060
Bro!

277
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,250
His shadow came out.

278
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,660
The shadows...!

279
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,340
No way...!

280
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,180
He's collecting all of the shadows
on the island and absorbing them.

281
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:23,260
Straw Hat, I'd say you absorbed
around 100 shadows.

282
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,150
In that case, I'm absorbing 100...

283
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,770
200!

284
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,650
300!

285
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,470
400!

286
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,300
500!

287
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,220
600!

288
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,770
700!

289
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,900
800!

290
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,700
900!

291
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,040
1,000 shadows!

292
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,160
Darn it! Gosh darn it!

293
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,990
And here I thought we'd won!

294
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,830
But now he's 1,000 times bigger and stronger.

295
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,960
Size and strength don't mean squat!

296
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,500
I'll put everything I've got
into taking him down!

297
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,700
I'm going back out onto the ocean!

298
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

299
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,820
"Our Bodies Vanish! The Morning Sun
Shines on the Nightmarish Island!"

300
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
