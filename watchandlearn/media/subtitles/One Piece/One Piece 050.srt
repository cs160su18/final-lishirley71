00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,350
Don't be stupid!

22
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,230
You'll lose your arm!
Its sharpness is the real deal!

23
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,010
I'll take it.

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,370
Find Luffy! He's gotta be hiding
somewhere in Loguetown still!

25
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,370
Yes, sir!

26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,130
There's no need.

27
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,250
He will show himself to me again.

28
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,390
The execution platform!
The execution platform!

29
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,530
I wanna see the view the King
of the Pirates saw before he died!

30
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,890
I wanna see it now!

31
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,930
But... which way is
the execution platform?

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,820
"Usopp vs. Daddy the Parent;
Showdown at High Noon"

33
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,110
Captain Smoker!

34
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,320
Is this man named Luffy
really still on this island?!

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,890
We need to hurry and blockade the sea!

36
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,540
That won't be necessary.

37
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,690
How can you be so easygoing?!

38
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,230
--Stop!
--Hey! You can't come in here!

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,910
That's the navy captain's room!

40
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,620
Heya, Smoker.

41
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,840
So it's you, Daddy...

42
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,980
These are Two-Pistol Pete and
the Police-Killer Riley Brothers.

43
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,180
All three have bounties, huh?

44
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,690
I also dropped one off at the morgue.

45
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,530
I just need your signature
and I can get my money today.

46
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,740
One million Berries for four people?
These are all small fries...

47
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,810
Wanted men headed for the
Grand Line gather in this town.

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,310
I can earn money
more efficiently this way,

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,740
rather than looking high
and low for just one big name.

50
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,320
One of the Navy's most gifted snipers,
reduced to bullying weaklings.

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,700
How you've fallen...

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,040
I just don't feel like putting
my life in my guns' hands.

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Because if you die, your
daughter'll wind up on the street?

54
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,740
Give Carol my regards.

55
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,250
Yeah. I'll tell her the
old smoky man said hello.

56
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,770
That was Daddy Masterson,
the bounty hunter?

57
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,480
Yeah. We joined at
the same time, long ago.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,910
He was an elite, on the fast track
to being a key player at Navy HQ.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,940
Then why is he doing this now?

60
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,330
A cursed sword, huh?

61
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,340
Interesting.

62
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,730
Oh! That's a cool sword you have!

63
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,090
Damn! Don't scare me like that!

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,750
What're you doing here, Zoro?

65
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,080
No, what're you doing here?

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,100
Me?

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm lost.

68
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,300
Why're you acting cocky about that?!

69
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,220
--Hey, tell me.
--Hey! There he is!

70
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,020
--How do I get to the execution platform?
--It's him! That bastard!

71
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,500
What's that?

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,650
You bastard!

73
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,960
How dare you sell our
buddies to the Navy?!

74
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,420
You're gonna pay big-time!

75
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,170
Die!

76
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,490
Run on home and have your
mama bake you a cake, kiddo.

77
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
That old guy's cool!

78
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,480
I think that man might be...

79
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,600
...Daddy the Parent.

80
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,260
I bought a lot! A real lot!

81
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,800
Now my preparations to be a brave
warrior of the sea are complete!

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,170
All I'm forgetting now is...

83
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,810
Oh, yeah! I forgot the most
important thing! Goggles!

84
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,010
A top-class sniper needs
to have top-class goggles!

85
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,610
That's just basic! The most basic of all!

86
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,380
Investing every last bit of money
to get the best goggles around

87
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,490
is the spirit of a top-class sniper!

88
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,470
Goggles! Goggles!

89
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,820
These ones! These goggles!

90
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,500
It's gotta be these! I like 'em!

91
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,460
Lady!

92
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,580
You got a good eye! Them's the
latest North Blue model there!

93
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,220
I got 'em from an import ship that
leaves the Navy only once a year!

94
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,980
What's wrong? You got no money?

95
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,610
I don't do business with
people who don't got money!

96
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,850
What's it gonna be?!

97
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,770
N-No, it's... Oh! Right!
Backpack, backpack...

98
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,770
I'll take these goggles, please!

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,820
My! What a cute little girl!

100
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,660
Yes, yes! You're in luck!

101
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,730
This is the only pair
of these goggles in town!

102
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,650
Hold it right there!

103
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,340
I was the first to--!

104
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,910
Butt out... old man!

105
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,180
O...

106
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,170
Old man?

107
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,850
Stop! Stop right there, you!

108
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,730
Listen! Let's set the record
straight! I am not an old man!

109
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,050
Call me "Mister"! Got it?

110
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,950
Huh?! What for?! You're an old man!

111
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,060
Dammit, you said it again!

112
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,770
Gimme those goggles back!
I found 'em first!

113
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,650
Huh?!

114
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,810
You got a problem?! Huh?!

115
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,500
Keep up yer damn complainin'
and I'll call the marines!

116
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,440
M-Marines?

117
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,650
Yep! I'm friends with
a navy captain in this town!

118
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,300
The old smoky man!

119
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,410
W-Who is this girl?

120
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,680
So you don't know who I am, huh?!

121
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm Great Captain Usopp! I destroyed
Arlong's fishman pirate group!

122
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,680
It was truly a battle to the death!

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,780
Me, surrounded by 200--
no, 300 fishmen!

124
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,080
All alone, I punched, threw, stomped,
kicked, and tore them all up!

125
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,060
Thanks to that, I now have a
30 million Berry bounty on my head!

126
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,890
I see. 30 million...

127
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,410
Yep! That's right!

128
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Papa!

129
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,340
Papa?! Why am I your papa?!

130
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,390
Here's a present for you, Papa!

131
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,650
Happy birthday!

132
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,720
Oh, Carol...

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,980
What a nice, angelic girl you are!

134
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,930
I love you, Carol-chan!

135
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,790
Papa! I love you, Papa!

136
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,740
W-What's with this family?

137
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,060
But guess what! That old man there
is trying to swipe your present!

138
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,710
Now, now! You mustn't say "swipe"!

139
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,080
It's not good manners, you know.

140
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,260
Are you the one who's
bullying my adorable Carol?

141
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,980
B-B-Bullying...?

142
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,500
That's not all!

143
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,770
Huh?

144
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,850
You have a bounty of
30 million Berries, I hear?

145
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,800
Let's see here...

146
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,360
Are those the new wanted posters?

147
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,160
Yeah, I got 'em from
the outpost just now...

148
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,280
600,000... 1,300,000... 700,000...

149
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,630
30 million... Straw Hat Luffy?

150
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,640
A starting bounty at this amount...

151
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,930
Hold it, boy.

152
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,710
Y-Y-Yes?!

153
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,040
No, you see, sir!

154
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,070
I'm obviously not the person
on that poster! I was just lying!

155
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,400
My funny plan to trick people was
a great success! Ha ha! Well, bye!

156
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,710
That's you, isn't it?

157
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,950
T-T-That's right!
It sure is! That's me, all right!

158
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,240
But I'll tell you this!
Just you try and lay a hand on me!

159
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,740
My captain Luffy won't sit by quietly!

160
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,280
He's an evil,
cold-blooded, devilish man!

161
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,950
No one's ever defied him
and lived to tell about it!

162
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,070
You got a kid, right?
You should really value your life...

163
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,290
I see. That sounds bad.

164
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,930
Yes, given that this Luffy
fellow is worth 30 million Berries,

165
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,100
he's clearly no ordinary man.

166
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,300
Papa! You're obviously
way stronger, Papa!

167
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,280
You're the strongest guy in the world!

168
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,060
Carol. It's all right.

169
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,530
All that matters is that I make
enough money to live happily with you.

170
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,730
You're far more important to me
than being the world's greatest!

171
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,730
Papa...

172
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,500
The guy's wimping out
after I said all that!

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,200
Alright! In that case...!

174
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,010
Well?! Now do you see
how terrifying I am?!

175
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,910
Take my advice! Just hand
those goggles over to me!

176
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,950
Huh?!

177
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,830
Don't worry! I'll pay for 'em!

178
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,840
So just give 'em here!

179
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,010
Why're you saying that right after
he's just about to let you go--?!

180
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,090
Papa?

181
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,420
Then let's do this.

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,390
I assume you have no problem
with us settling this in a fair fight?

183
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,380
Fight?

184
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,300
Here!

185
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,390
Fight? Y-You're not
talking about a duel, right?

186
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,970
If you win, the goggles are yours.

187
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,870
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 30 pistols?!

188
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,820
D-Don't tell me you're...

189
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,350
...Daddy the Parent?!

190
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,980
The very same.

191
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,000
--A showdown!
--There's gonna be a showdown!

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,130
Daddy the Parent's
gonna duel somebody!

193
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,280
Did he say Daddy the Parent?

194
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,960
Daddy the Parent is the
greatest gunslinger bounty hunter!

195
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,150
Everyone in the East Blue knows that!

196
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,940
I wonder what the idiot who'd
challenge him to a duel looks like!

197
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,740
Oh. Like that.

198
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,490
Good luck, Long-nose!

199
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,560
Don't worry if he beats ya!
We already got a place dug for ya!

200
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,240
H-How did things turn out
this way? Am I an idiot?!

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,400
The rules are simple. We both
walk 10 paces and then shoot.

202
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,290
Y-Yeah...

203
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,000
What are you doing?!

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,940
Nami!

205
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,960
Fighting Daddy the Parent
in a duel... Are you an idiot?!

206
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,180
S-Shut up!

207
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,170
Things just turned out this way!
Shut up and watch!

208
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,180
You get one shot. Are you ready?

209
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,030
Yeah.

210
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,130
Yeah...

211
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,410
One!

212
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,900
Two!

213
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,810
Three!

214
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,050
Four!

215
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,910
Five!

216
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
This is bad... Really bad...

217
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,620
There's no way I can possibly
beat Daddy the Parent...

218
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,580
Six!

219
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,580
Am I going to die here?!
This can't be happening!

220
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,540
Seven!

221
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,680
I just started my adventure!

222
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,530
I haven't even gained any courage
or manliness or anything yet!

223
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,640
Eight!

224
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,810
Bye, now!

225
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,540
Papa!

226
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,700
You're amazing, Papa!
You're so cool!

227
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,340
Man, how pathetic.

228
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,880
What a lame duel.

229
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,730
I thought he'd have more guts than that.

230
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,080
What a disappointment.

231
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,860
I only shot his gun away.

232
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,100
What's with you?!
Tryin' to cheat like that!

233
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,840
You coward! Weakling!
Can't you even fight honestly?!

234
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,980
I-I'm sorry! Forgive me!
I'm just a lowly, pathetic man!

235
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,720
Taking the life of someone like
me wouldn't gain you anything!

236
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,440
Right?! Right?!

237
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,640
Couldn't you just peacefully let me go?

238
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,520
W-Wait!

239
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,530
Nami!

240
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,870
Y-Yeah! If it's money you
want, she has tons of it!

241
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,120
Just please don't shoot me!
Please spare my life!

242
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,160
Hold on, now!

243
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,240
Oh? So you're trying
to hide behind a woman?

244
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,260
In any case--!

245
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,330
No! Forget what I just said!

246
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,860
She's just an innocent bystander
who has nothing to do with this!

247
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,310
Even if I wind up getting shot,
I can't let her get caught up in this!

248
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,160
Usopp...

249
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,970
Please! I beg you!

250
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,630
"Usopp..."

251
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,430
Is your name Usopp, boy?

252
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,430
Yeah.

253
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,530
It couldn't be...

254
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,940
Do you know a man named
Yasopp of the Red-Haired Pirates?

255
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,040
Yasopp? That's my old man's name.

256
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,440
Y-You've met my dad before?!

257
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,320
I see. So you are his son...

258
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,210
Papa?

259
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:04,030
I've never once told a soul
what happened on that day...

260
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,100
But you're an exception.

261
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,050
It happened at a hot, dry
port town, much like this one.

262
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,770
Let's do it, Ensign Masterson!
We each get one shot!

263
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,740
One!

264
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,400
Two!

265
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,430
Three!

266
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,220
He won!

267
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,410
Yasopp won!

268
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,710
Check it out! He beat one
of the Navy's best snipers!

269
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,110
That was truly a close fight!

270
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,780
You're the man, Yasopp!

271
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Yeah.

272
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,850
Yasopp! Finish him!

273
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,140
Yeah! Killin' the loser of
a duel is a sign of kindness!

274
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,880
Kill me!

275
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,280
Now that I've lost a duel,
I have no reason to live...

276
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,270
Yeah. You've got good resolve.

277
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,740
What are you doing?

278
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,710
Your daughter?

279
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,890
Give it back...

280
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,320
A navy ensign of all people,
carefully treasuring something like this...

281
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,830
She must be really spoiled.

282
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,530
Don't lecture me, you filthy pirate!

283
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,200
That's fine by me!

284
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,060
You were great, Yasopp!

285
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,440
It was nothin'.

286
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,210
The pain of this wound just goes
to show how inexperienced I am.

287
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,540
You took on Daddy Masterson!

288
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,790
You won because you're you!

289
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,940
We never would've stood a chance...

290
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,370
Thanks, Boss!

291
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,270
I appreciate your watching
the duel without saying anything!

292
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,500
That's the stuff!
You want some, Ensign?

293
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,470
Family, huh?

294
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,820
Family's not so bad.
But I'm no good at it.

295
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,930
Huh?

296
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,250
I got a son of my own.
His name's Usopp.

297
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,750
Haven't seen him in years now.

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,400
I hit the high seas around
the time he was a toddler.

299
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,130
Why? Do you not love your son?

300
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,060
It wasn't about that.

301
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,970
A pirate flag...

302
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,280
A Jolly Roger was calling for me.

303
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,180
You tell 'im, Yasopp!

304
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,000
Now, then...

305
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,750
There's nothing I can do for my son.

306
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,170
Just one hopeless
parent like me is too many!

307
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,200
Always stay by your daughter's side.

308
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,300
You can't let her feel lonely.

309
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,340
Though I'm in no position to talk!

310
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,120
I lost our duel!
Yasopp! Finish me off!

311
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,050
Don't give me your lousy sympathy!

312
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,040
Forget it!

313
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,990
You navy guys might hang us by
our necks right after you catch us,

314
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,830
but we pirates are free to let you
live or die however we please!

315
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,000
So long!

316
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,980
So that's why a navy elite
turned to bounty-hunting...

317
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,620
Papa! You lost to a pirate,
Papa?! He spared your life?!

318
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,520
Say it isn't true, Papa!

319
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,140
But that's amazing!
Your dad must be really skilled!

320
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,200
He even beat Daddy!

321
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
Plus he hadn't forgotten about you!

322
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Even now, when he's living an adventure,

323
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
he has an image of you
etched in his memory!

324
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,160
Usopp?

325
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,040
Yeah. I can understand
how you'd feel...

326
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,740
No! That's not why...

327
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,710
That's not why I'm crying!

328
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,650
Would you normally do that?!

329
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,460
Would you normally tell
some pathetic boy like me

330
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,170
a story about you shamelessly
having your life spared?!

331
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,540
You told me that to give me courage!

332
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,580
Most people would be vain
and keep a story like that secret!

333
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,060
You told me even though you
knew it'd make you less cool!

334
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,950
Regardless of how brave my
old man might be! Right?!

335
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,200
Weaklings or cowards
could never do that!

336
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,750
Carol! Your dad is
the bravest man alive!

337
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,280
You can find strong guys any old place!

338
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,280
But I've never seen a man as
strong and kind as your dad before!

339
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,660
I... I can't give in, either!

340
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,370
I gotta be brave, or I'll shame your dad!

341
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,800
Daddy! Give me a chance!

342
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,630
Fight me in another life-or-death match!

343
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,220
I won't cheat anymore!

344
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,910
All right. This will be our real match.

345
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,360
Choose the weapon
you're most skilled with.

346
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,950
Good. Now, then. Let's see...

347
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Try and hit that weathervane.

348
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,990
Weathervane? That?!

349
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,500
Miss it, and...

350
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,160
Y-Yeah! You can shoot
me right through the heart!

351
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,960
Usopp!

352
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,640
My life is on the line for real this time!

353
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,510
There's...

354
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,760
There's no way he can
shoot that far with that thing...

355
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,960
J-Just like always...

356
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,770
Just shoot like you always do...

357
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,670
Yeah...

358
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,310
Concentrate...

359
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,420
You missed!

360
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,370
No, Papa! Don't shoot him! Papa!

361
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,050
I can't shoot him. Usopp shot
right through its crown!

362
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,370
H-He really did!
Right through the crown!

363
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,530
Usopp!

364
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,800
You're an excellent shot.
I'd expect no less of Yasopp's son.

365
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,490
Never forget that bravery.

366
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,790
Someday you will
become like your father!

367
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,970
Go to the Grand Line.
I'm certain Yasopp is there.

368
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,960
Daddy...

369
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,380
You're pretty good, old man!

370
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,750
Aren't these...

371
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,200
It's okay!

372
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
So long!

373
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,630
Papa!

374
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,680
Carol, you know that's not right.

375
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,050
It's poor manners to say, "So long!"

376
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,850
Yeah! I'm sorry, Papa!

377
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,770
I'm going to grow up to be a nice
lady worthy of being your daughter!

378
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,890
So forgive me!

379
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,760
You're already plenty
nice as you are now!

380
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,610
I'm going to be an even nicer lady!

381
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,230
Even when people say he's a
disgrace behind his back now,

382
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,480
he's fought all this time
to protect the one he loves.

383
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,420
I'm going to be a
brave man like Daddy, too!

384
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,610
I'm gonna become a real warrior
and stand before my dad someday!

385
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm certain of it!

386
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,220
Sanji! I've been looking for you, Sanji!

387
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,620
For ten years!

388
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

389
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

390
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,670
I'll set off by myself,

391
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,630
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

392
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,400
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

393
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,490
Why is it so hot?

394
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:55,490
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

395
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

396
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

397
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

398
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

399
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,540
They're saying there's
a cooking contest!

400
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,780
Huh? Cooking techniques aren't
meant for competing against people!

401
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,310
They're for delighting Nami-san!

402
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,660
Thanks, Sanji-kun!

403
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,110
What? You're not gonna enter?

404
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,660
You get that if you win, right?

405
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,900
Wait, that's... an elephant bluefin tuna!

406
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

407
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,520
"Fiery Cooking Battle?
Sanji vs. the Beautiful Chef"

408
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,750
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
