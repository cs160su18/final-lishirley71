2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,690
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,630
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,770
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,700
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,190
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,840
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,510
What do you think you're doing?!

25
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,880
Stop that!

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,320
What are you doing to my sea charts?!

27
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,910
"Fishmen" and "sea charts" this,
"circumstances" that...

28
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,620
I don't know about any of that...

29
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,650
...but I'm gonna destroy everything!

30
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,320
Gum-Gum...

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,320
...Battle-Axe!

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,080
Nami!

33
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,550
You're my friend!

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Yeah!

35
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,370
"Setting Out with a Smile!
Farewell, Hometown Cocoyashi Village"

36
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,680
Arlong Park has fallen!

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,160
We're free!

38
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,650
We're free!

39
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,760
Free!

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,220
Everyone! Celebrate! Dance!
Arlong Park has fallen!

41
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,060
We've lived these
past eight years for this!

42
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,100
We've lived so we can smile today!

43
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,490
We're gonna party 'til we drop,
even into tomorrow and the day after!

44
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,280
Lady!

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,290
Chabo...

46
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,170
I just saw Arlong Park for myself!
It's awesome! It's in pieces!

47
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,930
Pretty awesome, huh?

48
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,860
Yeah! The guy who did
that must be really cool!

49
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,130
Who was it?! The guy who
beat Arlong is here, right?!

50
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,770
Yeah. Right over there.

51
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,400
Which one?! Which one?!

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,160
The guy with the straw hat.

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,050
Are you sure he saved the island?

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,300
Unbelievable as it may seem.

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,090
Meat! Is there any more meat?!

56
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
He's still at it.

57
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,210
Sounds like ol' Zoro's really hurtin'.

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,910
Well, yeah.

59
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,920
A normal person with those wounds
would take two years to fully heal!

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,960
You fool!

61
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,970
Trying to take care of such
a big injury on your own...!

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,160
Oww!

63
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,180
Honestly! Are you folks really pirates?!

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,490
Don't you even have... a ship doctor?!

65
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,950
A doctor? That sounds good, too!

66
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,860
Luffy?

67
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,060
-But a musician comes first. Right, Zoro?

68
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,460
Why's that?!

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,660
Pirates sing, you know?

70
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,380
So why does that come first?!

71
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,750
Hey, Doctor. Where's Nami?

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,710
She doesn't seem to be here...

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,390
Nami, huh?

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,490
If you can't find her around,
then she's probably "there."

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,940
What?! You're still here, Nami?

76
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,980
Your friends've been
looking for you, you know.

77
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,980
Say, Nojiko, Gen-san.

78
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,940
If Bellemere-san were alive,

79
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,830
do you think she would
stop me from being a pirate?

80
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,830
A pirate?!

81
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,310
Give me a break!

82
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,320
Of course she'd never let her
precious daughter be a pirate!

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,420
She wouldn't stop you!

84
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,020
Nojiko!

85
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,820
Even if she did...

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,180
...would you really listen to her?

87
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,350
Absolutely not!

88
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,760
I see...

89
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,740
What's with you, Gen-san?

90
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,810
You two are definitely
Bellemere's kids, all right.

91
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,540
Gen-san?

92
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,850
Nami. You've already
made up your mind, right?

93
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,520
Then live how you want!

94
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,070
Just as your mother did!

95
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm sure that's what
Bellemere wants, too.

96
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,140
Whew, I'm stuffed!

97
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,080
Sometimes it's nice to only eat!

98
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,350
Are your wounds all better now, Zoro?

99
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,280
This's nothin'! Some food
and drink'll fix it right up!

100
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,420
Yeah?

101
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,020
But how long is this
dumb party gonna last?

102
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,120
This is the third day now!

103
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
What's wrong with that?

104
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,670
When you wanna celebrate,
you should go all out.

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,960
Hey, Sanji! That melon you just had!

106
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,400
Was there something on it?!

107
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,740
What's with the meat in your hands?!

108
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,210
Sure was. It's "raw ham melon,"
so there was raw ham on it.

109
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,280
Raw ham melon?! That sounds yum!
W-Where did you get it?!

110
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
Dunno...

111
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,130
The whole village is a buffet party,
so I dunno where I got it...

112
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,180
He's long gone.

113
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,530
He's been eating non-stop
for three days straight!

114
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,590
Now, then. I'm done eating.

115
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,320
Now I think I'll...

116
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,890
...pick up some girls!

117
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,730
I am Captain Usopp...

118
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,880
Way to go, kiddo!

119
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,040
...hero of love and courage...

120
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,040
Can I have your autograph?!

121
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,340
...who finished off the
strongest fishman boss!

122
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,940
Here's an Usopp Support Song!

123
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,450
Who was it? Who was it?
Who beat the fishman?

124
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,880
Hmph. How boring.

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,850
What is?

126
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,020
I thought you'd be
more down in the dumps.

127
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,010
Like, "Why didn't this happen
before my dad died?!"

128
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,810
That's how I felt at first.

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,100
But now I'm thinking about the future.

130
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,020
The future?

131
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,570
We've been saved by that
straw hat guy and his friends.

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,380
But starting tomorrow, we have
to start from scratch on our own.

133
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,150
There's no way we can forget
what's happened in the past,

134
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,590
and I don't think we need to.

135
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,540
But, I think what's most important
is what happens from now on!

136
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,800
What we do now.
What things we need to do.

137
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,210
We're the ones who're gonna
support the villages now,

138
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,930
so I decided to think that way instead!

139
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,860
Cheeky kid!

140
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,030
Oww!

141
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,030
Why're you pinching me?!
I don't understand! Why?!

142
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,270
And here I was hoping to harass
you some more for good measure!

143
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,130
You've harassed me plenty,
you dumb tattoo punk girl!

144
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,580
"Punk" will do just fine!

145
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
Will it come off?

146
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,170
I'd like to say, "No problem,"

147
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,190
but there's no way to remove it fully.

148
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,050
There'll be some scarring.
That's how tattoos are.

149
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Yeah. I know it's stupid of me.
They stay on for life.

150
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,820
I don't want anyone to see this!

151
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,490
This... this tattoo...

152
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,780
I'm not even really Arlong's friend...

153
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,810
...but it's like I've
been branded a pirate!

154
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,830
Nami...

155
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,090
Nojiko! What is that?!

156
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,070
Oh? You mean this?

157
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,700
It's no big deal! It's just a decoration!

158
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,830
Now me and you are the same!

159
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,120
Say, Doctor.

160
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,310
There's a tattoo I'd like to have...

161
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,500
Here.

162
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,280
Those two can dance!

163
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,220
Here's Usopp Support Song #185!

164
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,690
Bellemere.

165
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,160
Your daughters have grown up
to be truly strong and respectable!

166
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,880
It's almost as if I'm
seeing you in life again!

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,880
What?! You're going to be a marine?!

168
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,390
There's no use trying
to stop me! I'm going!

169
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,780
My mind's set!

170
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,800
We're going to live life
to its fullest from now on.

171
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,030
We've lost and sacrificed far too much.

172
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,310
Which is why we're going to smile
as insanely much as possible now.

173
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,730
Raw ham melon!

174
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,740
Huh? There's no food around here.
That's no good. Time to go back.

175
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,700
Hold it, boy!

176
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,820
A grave? Did someone die?

177
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,170
Yeah. A long time ago.

178
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,160
Oh, my deepest conveniences.

179
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,440
Huh? Deepest concussions.
Huh? Deepest compli--

180
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,520
Deepest condolences.

181
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,630
That.

182
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,900
Hey, boy.

183
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,000
Nami is going to ride your ship.
She's going to be a pirate.

184
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,900
It'll be a dangerous journey.

185
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,180
That's fine. There's no way around that.

186
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,710
But, if you guys ever do anything
to take away Nami's smile...

187
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,070
...I will come kill you!

188
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,160
Yeah. I'm not gonna
take it away, though.

189
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,620
Got it?!

190
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,610
I got it!

191
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,710
Usopp Support Song #368!

192
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,830
Who is he? Who is he?

193
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,920
He's the coolest guy in the world!
His name is Great Captain Usopp!

194
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,780
"I'm leaving this behind.
This belongs to all the villagers. --Nami."

195
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,650
Wow! Today's a big feast!

196
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,710
Do you two know what today is?

197
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,320
Today is the day I first met you two!

198
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,240
It's the day you two
became my daughters!

199
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,170
Wow!

200
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,040
C'mon, stop crying!

201
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,210
A storm destroyed
the orchard. So what?

202
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,410
You need to be strong girls who
can smile even during hard times!

203
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,900
Do that, and then nice
things will come to you!

204
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,110
It'll come, I promise!

205
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,370
Nami! Could you get me the salt?

206
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,370
First you learned how to draw
sea charts, and now land maps!

207
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,900
I'm studying navigation too now!

208
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,070
Navigation, too?!

209
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,000
It is Nami's dream!

210
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,590
I'm gonna use my navigation skills
to travel to all the world's oceans!

211
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,220
And then I'm gonna make a
world map of everything I see!

212
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,180
So your map of this island is your
first step toward your dream, then?

213
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,610
Yeah!

214
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,310
It's all over, Bellemere-san.

215
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,140
It took eight years,
but we're finally free!

216
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,560
Me, and all the others...

217
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,570
It's exactly like you said.

218
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,970
"If you live through it,
nice things will come."

219
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,410
You were right!

220
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,430
All the villagers are smiling so happily
from the bottom of their hearts!

221
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,760
And me! I'm thinking
of leaving this island!

222
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,420
It's all right! Don't worry!

223
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,240
They're really pleasant people,
and pretty strong, too!

224
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,430
For eight years, I drew
lots of charts and maps...

225
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,240
...but this is the only one that's left.

226
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,470
But that's exactly it! This time,
I'm going to draw charts for me!

227
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm going to travel the world
with them-- my friends!

228
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,250
That was my dream, so... so...

229
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,240
...I'm not sure when I'll
come back to this island...

230
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,030
I'm... going now.

231
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,780
This the last of it?

232
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,200
Yeah!

233
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,950
Alright!

234
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,280
Are you finished loading it all?

235
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah!

236
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,230
Now, then. We got lots of
provisions now. We're good to go.

237
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,690
We were only here a few days,
but this island's full of memories, huh?

238
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,020
Yeah!

239
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,240
We owe you a lot for
everything you've done.

240
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,920
We're gonna get back to our
profession of bounty-hunting again!

241
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,080
This is goodbye for now,

242
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,220
but we look forward to the day
we meet again somewhere!

243
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,510
Take care!

244
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,270
You guys, too!

245
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,980
Well, we should get going, too!

246
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,510
Hey! Hold on! What about Nami-san?!

247
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Maybe she's not coming?

248
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,150
W-Why not?!

249
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,300
You! You made another pass
at Nami-san again, didn't you?!

250
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,470
Why would I do that?

251
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,090
No, you definitely did!

252
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,090
Oh, yeah. She achieved her goal,

253
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,280
and she has no reason to be a pirate,

254
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,280
You can't stand that me and
Nami-san are all lovey-dovey!

255
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,580
so she might be happier here.

256
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,250
Are you an idiot?

257
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,730
What'd you call me?!

258
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,120
What about my happiness?!

259
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,890
If Nami-san isn't on the boat,

260
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,090
then 98.72% of my reason
for being on the boat is gone!

261
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,120
Hey, you! I couldn't find
the raw ham melon anywhere!

262
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,860
Hey! Where's Nacchan?

263
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,630
That's the thing! Nobody's
seen her since this morning!

264
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,600
What?! She's leaving
all the money behind?!

265
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,370
The 100 million Berries?!

266
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,210
She left it in our house,
along with a letter.

267
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,780
She's planning to journey
without her money?!

268
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,380
But she's the one who
risked her life to earn it!

269
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,970
She says it's okay, because
she'll just steal some more.

270
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,460
Once that girl says something,
there's no changing her mind.

271
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,780
That fool! We're the ones who
still haven't thanked her enough!

272
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,760
Nami-san!

273
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,720
Nami!

274
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,470
Nami!

275
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,680
Nami-san!

276
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,680
Nacchan!

277
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,020
Get the ship moving!

278
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,850
Huh? She's started sprinting!

279
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,290
She says to get the ship moving.

280
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,930
But...!

281
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
Don't tell me she's planning to leave

282
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,450
without letting us
thank her or say goodbye?!

283
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,410
You can't be serious!

284
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,570
Set the sails!

285
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,480
H-Hey!

286
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,210
They're setting sail!

287
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,950
Wait! We still haven't thanked you!

288
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,860
Stop, Nacchan!

289
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,890
At least let us thank you!

290
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,120
Hold it! I won't allow
you to leave like this!

291
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,160
Hey. Is it okay to let her leave like this?

292
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,100
Why not? It's her decision.

293
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,830
Nami!

294
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,580
Why?!

295
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,340
Nami!

296
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,890
She didn't!

297
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,820
Huh? My wallet's gone!

298
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,650
Mine, too!

299
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,040
Mine, too!

300
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,100
Same here!

301
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,840
Take care, everyone!

302
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,630
How dare you?!

303
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,850
You damn brat!

304
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,260
Hey. She hasn't changed a bit.

305
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,700
Who knows when she'll betray us again?

306
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,240
Nami-san! Good!

307
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,820
You lousy sneak thief!

308
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,230
Get back here!

309
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,870
Give back our wallets!

310
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,960
You punk!

311
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,790
Come back anytime!

312
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,070
Take care of yourself!

313
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,600
We're grateful to you guys!

314
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,270
Boy!

315
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,310
Don't forget our promise!

316
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,430
Bye, everyone! I'll be back!

317
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,090
She got us good!

318
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,330
My own little sister got me!

319
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,990
Have fun!

320
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,750
Here, Genzo.

321
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,510
What's this scrap of paper, Doctor?

322
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,870
That fool. She never learns.
She got another tattoo before she left.

323
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,240
What mark is this?

324
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,690
It's a tangerine and a
pinwheel, apparently.

325
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,580
Huh? Gen-san!
What happened to your pinwheel?

326
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,310
I doubt there's any need for it now.

327
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,440
I'll be back!

328
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,340
Hold on, Gen-san!
Stay away from Nami!

329
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,270
No, but, I want to see her smile, too!

330
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,630
She starts crying because
you have such a scary face!

331
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,950
But what am I supposed
to do about that?

332
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,900
I know!

333
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,170
This'll make you laugh, right?!
If I always keep it here like this?!

334
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,280
What do you say, Nami-chan?

335
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,910
Look. I really don't think a dumb
pinwheel is going to make Nami...

336
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,930
Oh. She laughed.

337
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

338
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

339
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

340
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

341
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

342
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

343
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

344
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

345
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

346
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

347
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

348
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,190
Oh, no!

349
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,380
What's the matter?!

350
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,310
The newspaper's gone up in price!

351
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,630
What kind of problem is that?!

352
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,710
Then don't buy it!

353
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,530
What're you saying? We hafta
know what's going on in the world!

354
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,150
Plus we can use the backs
of the flyers as notepads!

355
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,630
Oh! Good thinking!

356
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,370
See, like so!

357
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,440
Huh?! This is...!

358
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,090
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,360
"Bounty! Straw Hat Luffy
Becomes Known to the World"

360
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
