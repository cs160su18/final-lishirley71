00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,970
My treasure?

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,820
If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,960
Find it!

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,380
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,680
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,650
and set out in search
of something to find

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,440
ONE PIECE!

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,370
Compasses only cause delays

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,860
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,760
If the dusty treasure map

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,810
has been verified,

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,200
it's not a legend!

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,260
When it comes to personal storms,

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn't there!

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,540
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,490
We are, We are on the cruise!

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,800
We are!

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,040
Wealth, fame, power...

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,750
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world
to the seas.

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,150
My treasure?

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,380
If you want it, you can have it!

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,770
Find it!

36
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,830
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,370
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

39
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,610
That's...

40
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,530
Hey... don't tell me...

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,770
...those are the ancient
weapon Pluton's blueprints...!

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,870
They're the real deal.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
Do you believe me?

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,740
Hey, Spanda.

45
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,840
What Tom-san and Iceberg
risked their lives to protect is...

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,200
Hand them over to me already!

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,300
...the wish of this weapon's architect--

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,350
that is, if the ancient weapon fell
into the hands of an idiot like you

49
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,810
and started being used to cause trouble,

50
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,180
he would want another weapon
to be built in order to stop it.

51
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,300
It's true that if you use Nico Robin,
you can revive the ancient weapon.

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,740
Even if she doesn't want to help you,

53
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,280
as long as there's a chance
that she could be used,

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,150
she's still dangerous.

55
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,740
But she's got friends

56
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,290
who would be willing to risk
their lives to protect her.

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,900
So I'll...

58
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,950
...take a chance.

59
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,980
You bastard! What're you doing?!

60
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,410
It's burned black!

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,920
Now, there's no longer power to
fight back against the ancient weapon.

62
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,360
If nothing is done and Nico Robin
falls into your hands, it'll be hopeless.

63
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,060
But if the Straw Hats win...

64
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,860
...there won't be
anything left to you at all.

65
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,830
I made a bet on their victory.

66
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,320
Cutty Flam...

67
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,310
How dare you...

68
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,790
...burn my blueprints?!

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
Ahhh! Bro!

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,560
Bro is falling into the falls!

71
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,700
Franky!

72
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,270
Hey, pirates!

73
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,500
What the hell is that?!

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,690
Jump with all your might
towards the falls!

75
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,620
R-Rocketman?!

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,500
It's flying again!

77
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,630
This brings back memories,
doesn't it, Tom-san?

78
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,810
About assisting that Roger guy...

79
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,430
I'm resolutely proud of it!

80
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,330
I'm Luffy. I'm the man
who'll be King of the Pirates.

81
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,950
Really?!

82
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,520
Yeah.

83
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,900
Roger was an idiot

84
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,790
like him, too, wasn't he?

85
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,890
And you helped him out.

86
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,910
Seems like we didn't learn our lesson.

87
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,470
Everyone in Tom's Workers
is helping this pirate kid.

88
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,880
You would've done the same,
wouldn't you, Tom-san?

89
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,220
We're gonna collide!

90
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,230
W-We're gonna crash!

91
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,620
"Obtain the Five Keys!
The Straw Hat Pirates vs. CP9"

92
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,890
Run!

93
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,290
They're here...

94
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,710
Yoyoi!

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,400
They're here!

96
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Dammit!

97
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,270
Hey, come with me!

98
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,800
If only I could get these
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs off...

99
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,520
Now, I'm freeing you
of any restrictions, CP9!

100
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,860
Beat the crap out of them
here at the Tower of Law!

101
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,490
I'll give you permission
to slaughter them!

102
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,090
Lucci! Come with me!

103
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,490
Protecting my life is your
top priority!

104
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,640
Got that?!

105
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,080
Funkfreed!

106
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,490
All right, good boy.

107
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,220
An elephant...

108
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,850
who ate a Devil Fruit
with sword powers?!

109
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,070
No, it's actually the other way around.

110
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,310
This is a sword that ate
the Elephant-Elephant fruit.

111
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,770
In other words, it's an elephant sword.

112
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,870
I've got this treasured sword,
in addition to CP9.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,600
When I think about it calmly,
I've got nothing to be afraid of.

114
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,190
Now, let's head to the Gates of Justice!

115
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,990
Go ahead and get this woman
back if you can, Straw Hat!

116
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,590
Big Bro Franky is okay!

117
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,270
The Straw Hats have finally
reached the Tower of Law!

118
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,460
Bro is no longer a prisoner!

119
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,350
Looks like he's gonna join in the fight!

120
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,300
That's right!
He's that kind of person!

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,130
Get them, Bro!

122
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,890
Go! Straw Hat!

123
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,640
We're leaving the rest
to you, Straw Hat.

124
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,010
Hey, are you guys okay?!

125
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,020
Old Hag Kokoro?!
Little ones?!

126
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,480
What'd you come here for,

127
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,490
bringing out a dangerous thing
like Rocketman?!

128
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,960
W-Well, it saved me, too, but...

129
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,160
Hey! Hey, old hag!
Hang in there!

130
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,930
Hey! I beg you! Don't die!

131
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,020
Don't die!

132
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,340
I've got a nosebleed.

133
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,510
How could you walk away from this
sort of crash with just a nosebleed?!

134
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,640
All right! We're here!

135
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,020
Straw Hat...!

136
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,360
Hello!

137
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,730
Thanks, monster granny!

138
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,540
Hey, you guys!
Get up already!

139
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,220
That was nothing!

140
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,410
You're rubber. Don't lump us with you.

141
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,000
Us flesh-and-blood humans were
forced to charge in like that.

142
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,830
You think we're okay...?

143
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,840
No way!

144
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,180
Yup, they're all fine.

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,000
You guys are all weirdos, too, so...

146
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,590
Just sayin'.

147
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,530
There are stairs over there!

148
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,430
Let's hurry up and catch up to Robin!

149
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,130
Wait.

150
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,230
What the heck is that?!

151
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,220
Chapapapa...

152
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,830
We got invaded.

153
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,750
Even if you go
to the room you saw earlier,

154
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,850
Nico Robin isn't there anymore,

155
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,070
since Lucci took her to
the Gates of Justice.

156
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,450
What?!

157
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,130
Oh, and our Chief did, too.

158
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,600
Oh, is that right?!

159
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,410
Thanks for giving us
such valuable information.

160
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,580
Chapapa... I spilled the beans...

161
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,800
What a funny guy.

162
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,030
Oh, well...

163
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,150
They're headed there right now,

164
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,140
but I won't tell you how to get there,

165
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,920
and we, CP9,
won't let you go there, either.

166
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,770
We have an order to annihilate you guys.

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,770
Annihilation order...?

168
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,050
Unless you guys defeat us,

169
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,770
you won't be able
to set Nico Robin free.

170
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,950
Yeah.

171
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,440
You don't have to tell us that.
We're gonna do it anyway.

172
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,670
Chapapa...

173
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,840
What a high-spirited guy.

174
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,990
But let me tell you one more thing.

175
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,950
What?! Do as you wish.

176
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,540
Ah, thanks.

177
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,870
Then, I'll speak frankly.

178
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,130
Look at this!

179
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,470
A key?

180
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,590
What for?!

181
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,920
This is the key to unlock

182
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,880
the Sea Prism Stone
handcuffs on Nico Robin!

183
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,310
Sea Prism Stone?

184
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,800
It's a stone that cancels out
Devil Fruit powers.

185
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,600
I heard that it's as effective as when
Devil Fruit power holders fall into the sea.

186
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,410
So that's why Robin isn't fighting now,

187
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,940
despite how strong she actually is.

188
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,060
Yeah.

189
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,060
Under normal circumstances,

190
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,360
she isn't so weak that she'd helplessly
stay held captive by guys like that.

191
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,570
She must be feeling frustrated.

192
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,120
I see.

193
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,490
Even if you guys can rescue
Nico Robin by some chance,

194
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,130
since the Sea Prism Stone
is hard like diamonds,

195
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,330
the handcuffs will be on her forever.

196
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,730
Chapapa...

197
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,170
I spilled the beans again.

198
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,510
He really is funny.

199
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,220
If that's okay, keep on going to
rescue Nico Robin.

200
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,180
Chapapapapa!

201
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,790
Well, then...

202
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,520
...give that to us!

203
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,070
Looks like he can use
that technique, too.

204
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,190
Don't be so hasty.

205
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,790
I didn't say that this is the right key.

206
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,200
What?!

207
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,700
It might be

208
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,600
for different handcuffs.

209
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,930
Chapapa papa!

210
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,630
There are five CP9 members,

211
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,860
including me, in this tower.

212
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,480
Each one has a key

213
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,480
One, two, come on!

214
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,920
One, two, bad!

215
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,390
and is waiting for you.

216
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,390
Yow?!

217
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,560
Then, until we defeat you all
and get the keys,

218
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,770
and try them on Robin's handcuffs,

219
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,980
we won't know which one
is the right key?!

220
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,360
How stupid... Buying time?

221
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,310
While we're fighting,

222
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,450
you guys are trying to take Robin-chan
to the Gates of Justice, aren't you?!

223
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,040
That's right!

224
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,410
I spilled the beans again...

225
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,870
Catching up with Robin
quickly should be our priority.

226
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,770
We'll first get Robin back
and then worry about the key.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,390
Let's ignore that weirdo and hurry!

228
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,130
Chapa!

229
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,720
"That weirdo"

230
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,060
Chapapa!

231
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,220
You're smart.

232
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,490
But if you do that,

233
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,680
I'll ditch this key
into the sea! Chapapa!

234
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,560
We're giving you a chance.

235
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,150
See ya.

236
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,710
Ah! Wait, you jerk!

237
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,820
Hey, wait!

238
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,360
You wait!

239
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,500
Stop! Just a little bit longer!

240
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,840
Just wait until we decide
what each of us will do!

241
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,920
Ah! Let me go!

242
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,230
Calm down, Straw Hat.

243
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,170
Let me go!

244
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,170
Is Lucci that pigeon guy?

245
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,960
Yeah, that's right.

246
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,050
If he's with Robin-chan,

247
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,010
we should let at least
Luffy go on ahead.

248
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,420
Luffy.

249
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,850
At any rate, you just
beat up the pigeon guy.

250
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,270
Let me go! Let me go!

251
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,200
There are six of us excluding Luffy.

252
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,980
He said there are five CP9 members here.

253
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,240
We'll get the five keys for Robin-chan's
handcuffs from them and go after Luffy.

254
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,860
If Robin-kun goes through
the gates, it'll all be over.

255
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,540
It's all a race against time!

256
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,160
If we lose against them,
that means we lose time!

257
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,000
Everyone! Take them down
even if it costs you your life!

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,970
Yeah!

259
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,600
Good luck!

260
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,940
Let me go! Let me go!

261
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,850
There are six of us excluding Luffy.

262
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,610
He said there are five CP9 members here.

263
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,960
We'll get the five keys for Robin-chan's
handcuffs from them and go after Luffy.

264
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,410
If Robin-kun goes through
the gates, it'll all be over.

265
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,370
It's all a race against time!

266
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,660
If we lose against them,
that means we lose time!

267
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,630
Everyone! Take them down
even if it costs you your life!

268
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,810
Yeah!

269
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,590
Good luck!

270
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,840
Pirate guys!

271
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,620
Chimney? Gonbe?

272
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,640
Where did they go?

273
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,650
They were there up until just a bit ago!

274
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,980
I'm sure I'll bump into them somewhere!

275
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm not gonna let you go to
the Gates of Justice!

276
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,990
Robin!

277
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,780
A secret passage!

278
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,950
A secret passage! A secret passage!

279
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,240
A secret passage!

280
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,450
Geography!

281
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,600
Physics!

282
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,550
Stigma!

283
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,010
Marimba!

284
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,090
Bats...?

285
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,760
I-I wonder how far this goes...

286
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,700
I can hear something.

287
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,000
I've got nothing to be afraid of!

288
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,620
Let's go there!

289
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,260
Help won't come, Nico Robin.

290
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,340
They don't know how to get to the
Gates of Justice in the first place!

291
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,290
Come out! You pigeon jerk!

292
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,290
Is it this way?!

293
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,540
Is it that way?!

294
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,630
Which way is it...?!

295
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,130
Which way is it?!

296
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,590
Ooops.

297
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,680
That way?!

298
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,600
Which way...?!

299
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,480
Which way?!

300
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,320
Is it this way?!

301
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,570
This way! Robin!

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,450
Even he shouldn't be able
to follow us this far.

303
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,690
That's a weird room.

304
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,420
I have to do this and do this
one like this... and like this.

305
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,640
I wonder what he's doing.

306
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,990
Open, doors!

307
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,930
Whoa...

308
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,590
This is bad... Before I fight...

309
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,010
Where's the kitchen?!

310
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,210
Coup de Boo!

311
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,900
Because I used a bottle and
a half of cola for Coup de Boo,

312
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,640
I've used more than two bottles today!

313
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,870
Unless I fill up all three bottles,
I can't fight CP9!

314
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,310
That area looks like a kitchen!

315
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,490
Chapapapapa...

316
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,570
I'm Silent Fukurou!

317
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,410
I like rumors!

318
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,460
Do you want the key?

319
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,470
Dammit!

320
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,120
I still haven't refilled my cola yet!

321
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,720
Chapa...!

322
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,320
I wonder what this
dungeon-like hallway is?

323
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,350
Yoyoi!

324
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,230
You damn pirate!

325
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:19,030
You're doomed now that
I've caught you here!

326
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,960
Wait...

327
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,980
Wait...

328
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,450
a second...!

329
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,790
Yoyoi!

330
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,530
What a noisy guy...

331
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,220
No one was in there.

332
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,130
No one's in here.

333
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,860
Hmm, no one's in here.

334
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,520
All right, no one's in here.

335
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,990
What's going on?
I can't find anyone anywhere!

336
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,450
If no one's around, that's fine, though.

337
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,580
They must've gotten scared of me...

338
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,620
Ahhh...!

339
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,580
Someone's here!

340
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,670
He's sleeping...

341
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,400
Is he part of CP9, too?

342
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,770
H-He's sleeping with the
key right in front of him!

343
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,780
"Liquor"

344
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,690
Couldn't this be a huge,
lucky chance?!

345
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,730
What about this room?!

346
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,010
Dammit...

347
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,670
No one's here, either.

348
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,210
Please make yourself at home.

349
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,880
Shall I... make some tea?

350
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,480
Yes, please!

351
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,950
You've already drawn your swords?

352
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,910
Yeah, since they're
crying out for blood.

353
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,630
Ahh! Where'd you come
falling from, Zoro?!

354
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,170
Why the hell are you with a wolf?!

355
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,760
You're with a giraffe, too.

356
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,720
So this means that both of
them have Devil Fruit powers.

357
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,640
What's with CP9?!

358
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,110
Hey, hey... What is this place?! A zoo?!

359
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,480
"Devil Fruit Powers! Kaku
and Jabra Transform"

361
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
