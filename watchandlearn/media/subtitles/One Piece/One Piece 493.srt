2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,700
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,070
Luffy made a raid on the Navy HQ to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,220
But his struggle ended in vain
as the war came to a close.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,420
Ace is really dead, isn't he?!

63
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,170
Yes, he is dead!

64
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,280
Ace!!

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,870
"Luffy and Ace! The Story
of How the Brothers Met!"

66
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,550
The War of the Best in Marineford
left a scar in many people's mind.

67
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,700
10 years ago, in the East Blue,

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,930
there was a small village called Windmill
Village where people lived peacefully

69
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,590
but not far from it was Mt. Corvo
where people seldom stepped foot.

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,610
Only the strong could survive there and
the weak who entered were doomed to die.

71
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,030
What I'm saying is, grandpa...

72
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,330
I'll become the King of the Pirates...

73
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,580
Cut the crap!

74
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,750
Let me... Let me go!

75
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,630
On top of eating the Devil
Fruit, you're talking nonsense!

76
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,200
Luffy! Both you and Ace have to become

77
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,880
MONKEY D. GARP [10 YEARS AGO]

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,880
the strongest Navy soldiers!

79
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,060
Ow, ow, ow, dammit!

80
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,680
MONKEY D. LUFFY [10 YEARS AGO]

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,430
My body is rubber but why is it painful?!

82
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,790
Let me go, grandpa!

83
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,080
It was a mistake to leave
you in the Windmill Village!

84
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,480
Of all things, you like
pirates?! What a fool!

85
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,600
You can't make friends
with "Red-Haired" Shanks!

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,310
I wanna become...

87
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,500
Ouch!

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,200
...a strong man like Shanks!

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,370
Hey!

90
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,120
What's this place?

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,710
Stop it!! Whoever you are,
do you wanna get killed?!

92
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,760
It's me.

93
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,100
G-Garp-san!

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,980
CURLY DADAN

95
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,440
A MOUNTAIN BANDIT: DOGRA

96
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,900
A MOUNTAIN BANDIT: MAGRA

97
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,530
You're looking good.

98
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,410
Give me a break! Please,
you gotta have mercy on me!

99
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,950
Ace is 10 years old now!

100
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,580
Oh yeah, already? How is he?

101
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,730
It's not funny!

102
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,540
We can't handle him anymore!
You have to take him!

103
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,510
--Putting that aside...
--Don't put it aside!

104
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,970
You're annoying, kid!

105
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,590
Look after him, too.

106
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,300
Hey, Luffy, say "hi" to them.

107
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,200
Yo!

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,720
Who is that kid?

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,350
He is my grandson.

110
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,350
What?

111
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,400
What?!

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,070
One more?!

113
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,450
He's Garp's... I mean, Garp-san's grandson?!

114
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,740
We can't!

115
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,120
Alright then, Here's your choice.

116
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,700
Do you wanna spend all your
life in prison or raise him?

117
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,080
There are many crimes you
committed that I've overlooked.

118
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,540
Come on!

119
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,630
Well, I don't wanna get arrested but...

120
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,300
Sometimes I think that maybe it's better
to be in prison than take care of Ace...

121
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,390
But you want us to look after your
grandson, too? I bet he's also a monster.

122
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,020
Crappy shack!

123
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,190
You wanna fight?!

124
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,480
Not listening!

125
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,560
Boss! Are you alright?!

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,530
What is it?! Ugh, spit! Gross!

127
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,030
Who did it?!

128
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,910
Hey, you!

129
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,740
Say "sorry"! It's gross!

130
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,160
Ace!

131
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,310
Are you back, Ace?

132
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,000
PORTGAS D. ACE [10 YEARS AGO]

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,170
Hey, say "sorry"!

134
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,430
Luffy, this is Ace. He's
3 years older than you.

135
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,140
You're gonna live here with them from today.

136
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,290
What?! You can't just do that!

137
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,400
Be nice!

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,360
Is it decided?!

139
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,570
Any problem with that?

140
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,690
We'll take him!

141
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,490
That's all from me. I'll
stop by when I have time.

142
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,290
--Um... What about some child support?
--Put it on my bill.

143
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,250
--This is not a bar...
--Huh?

144
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,580
--You're always welcome!
--Boss, we can't take care of one more kid!

145
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,130
--Shut up! Let's just eat first! Fix it!
--Okay!

146
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,090
Say "sorry"!

147
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,420
Wait!

148
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,270
I'll leave this hat with you.

149
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,900
Where did he go?

150
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,680
Who are you?

151
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,860
Let me go!

152
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,920
Give me your money or I'll kill you!

153
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,630
I don't have any!

154
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,680
Then tell your parents
to bring some money here!

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,770
--Grandpa is my only...
--That's fine. What's his name?

156
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,010
Garp-san.

157
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,410
Is this kid...?!

158
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,840
He's gonna live here with us.

159
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,010
--Why did you accept?!
--This is not a day-care!

160
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,890
Our boss has no guts!

161
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,970
Shut up you all!

162
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,850
It's time to eat!

163
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,980
--Give it to me, fool!
--It's my meat!

164
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,020
I want some meat!

165
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,400
--You already ate!
--I want more!

166
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm not gonna give in to young people!

167
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,280
--You got to share!
--It's a dog-eat-dog world.

168
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,560
His arm stretches!

169
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,670
Dog?

170
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,200
It's your turn to wash dishes!

171
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,630
Can I have some more, pops!

172
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,670
I'm a woman!

173
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,950
Do you even know where you are now?!

174
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,690
No.

175
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,060
Then I'll tell you.

176
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,810
This is a den of the Dadan family,
mountain bandits that rule Mt. Corvo!

177
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,560
Mountain bandits? I hate mountain bandits!

178
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,150
Shut up, you little shit! We're
annoyed by having a kid like you!

179
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,400
If you don't wanna stay here, that's fine!

180
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,950
Go away and die like a dog somewhere!

181
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,580
Easy, easy, boss.

182
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,540
I wanna eat more...

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,370
I wanna have that meat, too.

184
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,840
These are all from a bison that Ace brought.

185
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,220
He gave us a cut of the
take so everybody can eat.

186
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,220
The mountain bandits' world is rough sailing.

187
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,220
You're gonna have to work
pretty hard from tomorrow!

188
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,520
Cleaning, laundry, polishing
shoes and weapons,

189
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,730
burglary, robbery, fraud, and murder!

190
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,740
Remember, you can't tell
Garp what we make you do!

191
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,450
One bowl of rice and one
glass of water for a day!

192
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,620
That's all I can guarantee you.

193
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,960
You gotta get everything else by
yourself and grow up on your own.

194
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay!

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,210
"Okay"?! Why don't you cry or something?

196
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,130
I'm fine because grandpa
threw me into a jungle once

197
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,470
and there was water to drink and frogs,
snakes, and mushrooms to eat in the forest!

198
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,930
Plus, I'll become a pirate someday so...

199
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,600
...I must be strong like that!

200
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,310
--Boss!
--Are you alright?!

201
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,610
What're you doing?!

202
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,980
Here we go!

203
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,110
Where is he going?!

204
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,450
Here we go!

205
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,770
Where are you going?!

206
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,620
Did you just say "pirate"?

207
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,450
He's not listening!

208
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,750
Hey!

209
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,460
See? He's too tough!

210
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,090
That's why I didn't wanna
take care of Garp's grandson!

211
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,760
Easy, easy, boss.

212
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,990
Hey!

213
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,050
Wait for me!

214
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,820
Hey!

215
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,940
My name is Luffy! I'm not mad
about you spitting on me anymore!

216
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,450
Why are you laughing?!

217
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,370
He only spilled some booze on me.
It's nothing worth getting mad over.

218
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,890
It's nothing worth getting mad
over. Let's become friends!

219
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,830
Are you going somewhere?!

220
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,680
It's a dead end!

221
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,170
Hey! Ace is back!

222
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,970
Food!

223
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,260
Ace, did you come back alone?

224
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,200
Where is Luffy? I thought
that you were with him.

225
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I don't know.

226
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,230
That fool, where is he and what is he doing?

227
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,490
Maybe he's dead already.

228
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,030
We are dead if Garp finds out about this.

229
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,120
Boss must be pretty worried I bet!

230
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,200
--Get hold of yourself, boss!
--What did you say?!

231
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,920
I said it's not good that we
lost him on the first day!

232
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,250
Who cares! if he dies, he dies!

233
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,760
Garp is gonna kill us.

234
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,430
First of all, why should we
look after Garp's grandson?!

235
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,730
We're not nannies! He has to
take care of his own grandson!

236
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,020
--Why don't you say it to him?
--You have a problem?!

237
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,210
What if Gold Roger had a child?

238
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,040
Of course I know what'd happen to him!
He'd get his head cut off for sure!

239
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,920
I want to hear from him as he dies:

240
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,260
"I'm sorry I was born! I'm
just a piece of trash!"

241
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,650
I'm already giving up on Ace, too!

242
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,930
I don't care if he dies or not. I'll
just tell Garp it was an accident.

243
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,990
It's true that "the devil's
children have the devil's luck"!

244
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,120
He's the devil's son!

245
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,170
If the Government finds out about this,
what do you think they'd do to us?!

246
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,130
Easy, easy, boss.

247
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,920
You're drinking too much!

248
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,890
ONE WEEK LATER

249
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,890
One week later...

250
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,290
How annoying!

251
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,690
Why don't you shut up?

252
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,900
Boss! Boss Dadan!

253
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,580
Who is it?

254
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,740
Who is it?

255
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,660
--You!
--Luffy came back!

256
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,500
You fool! You're alive! You...!

257
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,260
Easy, easy, boss.

258
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,800
Where were you?!

259
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Easy, easy. Where were you
and what were you doing?

260
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,680
I've been chased by wolves
at the bottom of the valley.

261
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,980
What were you doing at
the bottom of the valley?

262
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,690
--Anyway, it's nice that you're okay.
--Yeah.

263
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,700
It's not okay! The pest came back!

264
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,530
Why don't you go to bed tonight?
You gotta work from tomorrow!

265
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,490
Already?

266
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,050
What's up?

267
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,420
Are you gonna go somewhere today, Ace?

268
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,430
Take me with you! Let's become friends!

269
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,260
Wait for me!

270
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,810
Boss! He's going after Ace again!

271
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Hey! You gotta do chores around the house!

272
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,110
No thank you!

273
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,340
You little shit! You're out of control!

274
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,690
Easy, easy, boss.

275
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,160
--Bring him back right now!
--Yes, ma'am.

276
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,370
Hey!

277
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,380
Ace!

278
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,960
Ace! Let's become friends!

279
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,080
The 8th day...

280
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,260
Ace!

281
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,960
Wait for me!

282
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,870
Boss!

283
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,920
Work, you little shit!

284
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,080
It's no use...

285
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,840
--Bring him back!
--Yes, ma'am.

286
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,670
I'm not gonna lose you today!

287
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,180
I can do that!

288
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,930
Let's become friends!

289
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,560
10 days have passed...

290
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,440
--Luffy!
--He's gone already...

291
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,110
Look for him!

292
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,910
He kept going after Ace and losing him.

293
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,840
But it went on everyday.

294
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,460
Ace!

295
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,090
1 month...

296
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,630
2 months...

297
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,670
Ace!

298
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,230
No matter if it rained and was windy...

299
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,560
Ace!

300
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,150
Luffy kept going after Ace desperately.

301
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,950
Luffy is chasing Ace again?!

302
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,220
How does he never learn after
getting hurt so many times?

303
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,990
Damn! He has to stop making me worry!

304
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,960
So you're worrying.

305
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,920
N-No way! Stop talking nonsense!

306
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,530
A bee-hive fell on me.

307
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,050
Who are you?

308
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,800
Ace!

309
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,440
Ace! Hey!

310
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,290
I can't believe he's coming
this far. He's so persistent.

311
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,260
Oh crap!

312
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,420
Damn! I lost him again! Ace runs so fast!

313
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,410
Is it Ace?!

314
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,380
That's the beast of Mt.
Corvo! No one can beat it!

315
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,510
Why is he not running?! It's gonna eat him!

316
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,640
I-I feel weak at the knees!

317
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,310
That fool!

318
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,990
Now, Luffy had been chasing Ace for 3
months with cuts and bruises all over...

319
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,790
It's the end of the forest.

320
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,950
What is this place?

321
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,630
Discarded junk lies around everywhere,
and smoke fills the air.

322
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,300
This is Gray Terminal, a town of outlaws.

323
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,720
Ace once took charge of the thugs here,

324
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,020
amassing funds in order to
