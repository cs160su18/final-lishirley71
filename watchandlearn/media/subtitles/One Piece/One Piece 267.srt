2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,830
We're not gonna let even
an ant pass through this gate!

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,250
Gatekeeper giants Oimo and Kashii
showed up at the main island front gate

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,670
and stood in the way of the
Franky Family. However...

5
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,550
Timber Hitch Tug!

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,390
Ow...! Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

7
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,980
...the situation was reversed
by Paulie and Zambai,

8
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,740
and the gate was about to be broken open.

9
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,820
Meanwhile, Luffy, who had already
passed the main island front gate,

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,080
was being slowed down by an
overwhelming number of soldiers.

11
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,470
Five are down?! So it was
actually just five guards?!

12
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,260
Geez... You can't even make a report properly?

13
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,390
Five... hundred guards...

14
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,350
"Tower of Law"

15
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,360
Lucci and the others,
with Franky and Robin in tow,

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,070
headed to the Tower of Law,
where Spandam was waiting for them.

17
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,570
Welcome back! Lucci, Kaku, Blueno, and Kalifa!

18
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,820
That's sexual harassment.

19
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,870
Just calling your name is?!

20
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,370
Anyway, you've done a great
job over the past five years.

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,250
Oh, that's right... This isn't really a
reward for your efforts or anything,

22
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,380
but I do have something I wanna give you.

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,880
Well, I'll do that later.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,100
So, in any case, let me meet...
the "hope" of the entire world!

25
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,600
And the Straw Hats on Rocketman
were getting ready to charge in.

26
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,440
Now, guys! It's time!

27
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,820
Let's go, shall we?

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,780
Samurai-man! Take care of the iron fence!

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,540
Leave it to me.

30
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,220
Go in already!

31
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,090
You too!

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,230
Coo coo?

33
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,400
Chapapa... Chapa!

34
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,290
I feel on top of the world!

35
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,750
I'm surprised to see you survived that
accident eight years ago, Cutty Flam.

36
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,050
And also... the woman whom
the world considers dangerous

37
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,260
and has been trying to capture, Nico Robin...

38
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,350
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

39
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,780
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

40
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,790
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

41
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,710
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

42
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:59,420
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

43
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,390
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

44
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,640
we will be able to make it through

45
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,850
Always!

46
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,610
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

47
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:23,570
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

48
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,660
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

49
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,200
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,500
We can't stop here

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Around the world

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,710
Start me up!

53
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,390
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

54
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:53,600
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,570
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

56
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,360
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,320
Brand New World

58
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,870
Start me up!

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
"Find a Way Out!
Rocketman Takes Flight!"

60
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,260
I'm feeling great! However...

61
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,140
...unfortunately, the public doesn't know

62
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,730
how truly valuable and great
what we've achieved today is.

63
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,770
It'll be several years...

64
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,860
...before it actually comes to be known.

65
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,450
In my opinion, the justice those old geezers
in the current Government dole out

66
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,160
is too lenient!

67
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,330
Goals can't be achieved without sacrifice.

68
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,920
We're working in order to
ensure peace for all of humanity.

69
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:06,470
It's fine if we have to sacrifice some
fools in our way to maintain peace...

70
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,760
...including that fishman who didn't
hand over what we told him to...

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,480
He deserved to be killed...
as a rebel against justice.

72
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,400
He deserved it. He did!

73
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,440
You're crazy!

74
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
Tom-san put his life on the line
to protect the blueprints

75
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,870
because idiots like you exist!

76
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,420
Wh-What're you guys doing?! Help me! Hey!

77
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,750
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow!

78
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,800
Kumadori!

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,260
Yoyoi!

80
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,810
Roger!

81
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,600
Hurry up and help me, hey! Hey!

82
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,730
Now... now... now...!

83
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,610
Yoi!

84
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,780
Yo...!

85
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,410
Ow!

86
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,670
Oh? Where did Chief Spandam go?

87
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,840
I... I'm here. I'm right here. H-H-Hey...

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,470
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

89
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,640
Gum-Gum... Whip!

90
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,480
Giant Scythe!

91
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,240
Bell!

92
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,740
Mallet!

93
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,330
Bazooka!

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,960
Gum-Gum... Stamp!

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,960
This is the main island, reporting to Chief!

96
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,930
Chief Spandam! Please come in!

97
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,090
It's no good! I can't get through!

98
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,680
Does he have the receiver off again?

99
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,850
Not again, at a critical time like this, seriously!

100
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,690
Hey, where did Straw Hat go?

101
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,520
He's right underneath you!

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,400
What?! Right underneath us?!

103
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,110
Attack him at once!

104
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,950
There he is! He's down there!

105
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,370
Dammit! I've been boxed in!

106
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,420
Gum-Gum... Volcano!

107
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,320
Th-The wall is... The wall is falling!

108
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,910
Get out of here!

109
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,370
Gum-Gum...

110
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,840
...Gatling!

111
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,510
Ah! Watch out!

112
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,600
Chief Spandam! Please come in!
Please advise us on countermeasures!

113
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
We can't stop Straw Hat Luffy!

114
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,190
Straw Hat Luffy is headed to the courthouse!

115
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,310
Strengthen defenses! Hurry up!

116
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,020
Be quiet!

117
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,690
What's this ruckus?!

118
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,280
You guys woke me up!

119
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,200
Ch-Chief Justice!

120
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,660
"'Three-Headed Baskerville'
Chief Justice, Enies Lobby"

121
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,660
That's right! As a matter of fact,
I am the Chief Justice of Enies Lobby!

122
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,460
On the left, I am Left Baskerville!

123
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,630
On the right, I am Right Baskerville!

124
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,590
And in the center, I am "Central Freeway"!

125
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,800
Say what?!

126
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,560
Ch-Chief Justice! A pirate is going
on a rampage on the main island,

127
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,020
but they said that they can't
get in touch with Chief Spandam.

128
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,400
Please give us instructions on his behalf!

129
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,860
A pirate! Pirates are guilty!

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,570
Hmm...

131
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,240
Oh, come on. Why don't
we make him not guilty?

132
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,950
Hmm... Then, let's split the
difference and give him...

133
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,290
...the death penalty!

134
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,750
Say what?!

135
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,170
There's trouble, Chief Justice!

136
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,040
We got a report that Kashii was taken out

137
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,000
at the main island front gate
by the Straw Hat's comrades

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,380
and that Oimo is losing, too!

139
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,220
What?! Don't let them past the gate!

140
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,510
Send 100 Watchdogs immediately!

141
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,560
Yes, sir!

142
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,770
Dammit! The promised five minutes is up!

143
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,480
This is bad! Hurry up and open
up the path for Rocketman!

144
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,900
I'm not gonna let you through this gate!

145
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,530
We unlocked the gate!

146
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,620
Now we can push the doors open!

147
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,290
What?! Shoot!

148
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,540
All right! Good going!

149
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,910
Go!

150
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,540
Don't touch this gate!

151
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,170
Rope Action!

152
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,010
Top Knot! Take this!

153
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,930
Whoa! Just what you'd expect
from a Galley-La foreman!

154
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,890
What?! This is just a rope!

155
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,180
Franky Family! Pull it!

156
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,980
Yeah!

157
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,650
Just leave it to us! Let's go, Sodom!
Gomorrah! Grab the rope!

158
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,830
Charge into the gate!

159
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,750
H-Hey! Hold on a sec! I'm feeling dizzy!

160
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,960
Push the doors!

161
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,420
Look! The doors are...!

162
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,300
The doors are opening!

163
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,050
What's Oimo doing?!

164
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,010
A little bit more!

165
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,990
The gate has been opened!

166
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,800
"Main Gate"

167
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,990
H-Hey...! Hey!

168
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,160
Hey...

169
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,420
That's... a sea train?

170
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,040
What's going on?

171
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,640
What?! It's rushing straight towards us!

172
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,650
Don't tell me they're trying
to jump onto the main island...!

173
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,610
Can't be! There's no way they
can jump over that iron fence!

174
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,760
Hurry up! Don't let them charge in!

175
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,470
Close the gate!

176
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,570
Hey, granny!

177
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,070
Hm? What is it?

178
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:53,280
Change of plans! Have the
train go as fast as it can!

179
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,580
Roger!

180
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,540
Roger!

181
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,290
Guys, looks like we're changing our plan.

182
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,290
The samurai-man says that everyone
should hold on tight to the car.

183
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,500
He said that!

184
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,250
Hold on tight?!

185
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,340
Why?

186
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,470
Hey, idiot swordsman! Did something happen?!

187
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,720
They closed the main gate.

188
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,220
What?!

189
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,140
What?! This is terrible!
We're gonna crash into the gate!

190
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,900
What're we gonna do?! What're we gonna do?!

191
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,190
--Dodge it, Kokoro-san!
--What're we gonna do?!

192
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,690
Don't worry. There's a way.

193
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,150
That's our Zoro!

194
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,410
Hit the fence with a thrust, frog!

195
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,330
What?!

196
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Ribbit!

197
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,710
Ribbit!

198
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,890
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

199
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,860
Don't tell me...!

200
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,940
If we keep on going like this,
we're gonna run ashore on the iron fence!

201
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,370
No way!

202
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,460
The sea train is...

203
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,750
...flying!

204
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Noo! We're gonna die!

205
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,260
What?! Are we gonna die?!

206
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,510
Ahhh!

207
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,180
Nami-san! Quickly, into my arms!

208
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,220
There's a huge hole where
we're gonna land, you idiot!

209
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,560
Zoro! You'd better have
thought about the landing!

210
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,480
Just leave it to...

211
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,320
Whoa...

212
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,700
--...luck.
--Ribbit!

213
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,910
So it's up to luck?!

214
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,500
Ahh! Oimo is down!

215
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,940
A-Are you... the Straw Hats?!

216
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,950
--That's right!
--We are?!

217
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,450
That's not important.

218
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,120
Let's hurry and move ahead!

219
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,330
All right! Guys! Now move
ahead as far as you can!

220
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,790
Yeah!

221
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,350
Paulie!

222
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,310
Dammit!

223
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,310
Who are you, bastards?!

224
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,440
We're the first-class guards of Enies Lobby,

225
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,860
the Watchdogs of the Law,
Watchdogs for short!

226
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,320
"'Watchdogs of the Law'
First-Class Guards, Enies Lobby"

227
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,320
On the orders of Chief Justice Baskerville,

228
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,070
we'll cast judgment on you
and bring you down at this gate!

229
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,660
Dammit! They send one guard
after another to block us!

230
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,330
Oimo! What're you doing?!

231
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,870
How could you let pirates
like them open the gate?!

232
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,500
Ow!

233
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,630
I passed out!

234
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,510
Oh, shoot! He came around!

235
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,310
I won't forgive you!
You're not gonna get away with this!

236
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,690
What?!

237
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,800
Wh-Why the hell...
did Rocketman come from the sky?!

238
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,760
There was no point in us opening the gate!

239
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,520
Wh-What just happened?!

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,650
Are they okay after charging in here like that?!

241
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,620
Th-They aren't coming out...

242
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,840
Hey, what happened?!

243
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,890
Wh-Who are those two?!

244
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,950
Huh? Should we have
introduced ourselves first?

245
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,950
That's stupid. Why should we?

246
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,820
Roronoa and the others are here!

247
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,040
We've been waiting!

248
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,880
It was just as I instructed.

249
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,800
Really?!

250
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,680
Gum-Gum... Storm!

251
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,430
He went that way!

252
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,560
Dammit!

253
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,270
Don't let him get away!

254
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,690
Hold it!

255
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,030
We've finally cornered him!

256
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,800
Y-You have nowhere else to run!

257
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,610
You guys...!

258
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,950
Don't get in my way!

259
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,180
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

260
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

261
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,220
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

262
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,230
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

263
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,520
We'll become No. 1

264
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

265
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,570
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

266
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,740
an era created by risking everything

267
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,860
We always try our best, let's go!

268
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,870
If we want to achieve glory,

269
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,280
now is the time--don't be afraid

270
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

271
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,170
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

272
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,130
We can take off with unknown powers

273
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,380
We don't fear, and we don't waver

274
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,180
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

275
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

276
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

277
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,350
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

278
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,360
Charge ahead

279
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,270
Let's start running towards tomorrow

280
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,240
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

281
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,120
Seriously, that idiot! He rushed out by himself!

282
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,920
What else is new?

283
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,670
But what're we gonna do?!
We're surrounded by a ton of enemies!

284
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,670
That's fine. I've been waiting for this.

285
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,050
Why don't we have some fun, too?

286
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,300
On the next episode of One Piece!

287
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,890
"Catch Up with Luffy!
The Straw Hats' All-Out Battle"

288
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,310
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
