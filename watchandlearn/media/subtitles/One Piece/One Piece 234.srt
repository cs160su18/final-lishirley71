00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,920
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,470
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,470
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,190
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,710
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,360
Hm?

24
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,440
Who's trying to defy the Franky Family?!

25
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,200
Give me the money back!

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,120
"Give me the money back"? Then are
you one of the Straw Hat's underlings?

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,630
That's right, Bro! Since he's with
Straw Hat Luffy, I expected him to be

28
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,260
a really strong pirate, but then...

29
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,340
He's so weak!

30
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,800
That's none of your business!

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Oops!

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,350
I'll admit you've got guts to come
to get the money back all by yourself,

33
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,230
but I can't let you have it back.

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,570
Give it back to me!

35
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,490
We have to... have our ship repaired...

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,620
That money is crucial to us!

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,880
With that money, we can finally...

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,430
We can finally repair the Merry's scars!

39
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,600
I can't let you jerks have it!

40
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:40,110
"Rescuing Our Friend!
Raid on the Franky House"

41
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,070
What are you so worked up about?

42
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,910
Looks like you love your ship quite a bit.

43
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,080
Well, no matter what happens to your ship,

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,050
this money is already ours.

45
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,800
Unfortunately for you, no matter what we
steal from pirates, we won't be accused

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,840
of committing a crime.

47
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,220
This is dirty money that you stole
from somewhere anyway, right?

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,690
Well, let us have it.

49
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,110
If you like, try begging the Navy for help.

50
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,990
You guys are the ones who'll be captured.

51
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,200
Too bad for Straw Hat Luffy...

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,660
...that he has a useless underling
who can't even watch over money.

53
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,420
Guys, have some fun with him later.

54
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm gonna take this money
and go shopping at once.

55
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,970
This is gonna be great!

56
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,640
Hold it! Special Attack! Exploding Star!

57
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,200
Remember this, long-nosed boy.
My name is Franky...

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,040
If you want to leave this town alive,
you shouldn't cross me.

59
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,500
Wh... What're you doing?! Let go of me!

60
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,800
Such a pathetic weapon wouldn't work on us.

61
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,760
See ya, Long-nose.

62
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,680
Thanks for the 200 million Berries.

63
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,900
Hold it! Give it back to me!

64
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,560
Give it back to me!

65
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,570
Give it back to me!!

66
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,620
Give it... back to me...

67
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,420
G-Give it back to me...!

68
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,590
Give it... back to me...!

69
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,940
Give it back to me!

70
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,370
Give it back to me!

71
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,170
I just have to hold out until Robin comes back.

72
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,720
I'll only become a burden to
them if I march in with them.

73
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,090
It'll be scary, too.

74
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,140
At any rate, I'll protect this ship and
the 100 million Berries all the way.

75
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,350
I'm counting on you... guys!

76
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,190
Stop. Stop!

77
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,490
If I remember right, this should be
the place Nami-san was talking about.

78
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,620
Look. This is the backstreet shopping district.

79
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,830
You go up this canal... and here!
Usopp is right here.

80
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,130
Okay.

81
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,210
So, Nami-san, where can we find these
demolition workers, the Franky Family?

82
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,970
Usopp!

83
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,390
He isn't here?

84
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,970
Are you sure? Didn't you just
screw up the directions?

85
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,930
I'm not you! Keep your mouth shut!

86
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,480
Usopp!

87
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,190
--What'd you say?!
--Ah, look at that!

88
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,570
Look! It's blood!

89
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,110
That idiot! He just walked off
without waiting for us!

90
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,410
Don't tell me he...

91
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,870
Usopp...

92
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,540
Hm?

93
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,040
"Ahhh..."

94
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,800
Help me!

95
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,140
Luffy?!

96
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,150
What're you doing?!
Where'd you come falling from?

97
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,650
Shipyard...

98
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,860
I was jumping around imitating this
one shipwright to look for Usopp.

99
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,820
Are you okay?

100
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,660
Yeah.

101
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,990
Oh, that's right. We've got a problem, guys!

102
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,120
Usopp got abducted along with the money.

103
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,540
Yeah, we know.

104
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,420
Come on. We're on our way to their hideout.

105
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,090
Usopp got beaten up and had
the money stolen from him.

106
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,050
What?!

107
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,050
It's possible that he felt responsible

108
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,560
and went to pick a fight with
the Franky Family all by himself.

109
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,440
Well, then... I'm leaving now.

110
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,700
Seriously, what a stubborn man he is.

111
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,200
Even though we don't know
whether he has it or not,

112
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,080
they send me out this far each time.

113
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,580
I wish people would put themselves in my shoes.

114
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,430
It's Kalifa.

115
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,550
Well... come in.

116
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,890
You must be worn out, Iceberg-san.

117
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,310
Would you like something to drink?

118
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,100
Yeah...

119
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,400
I'll have some tea today.

120
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,900
I've prepared it.

121
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,990
Well... Just as I'd expect from you, Kalifa.

122
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,240
Thank you very much.

123
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,200
Mr. Corgy is always angry
when he leaves, isn't he?

124
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,620
What on earth does he come to talk about?

125
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah...

126
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,170
He wants something I have,
so he suggests all sorts of deals.

127
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,840
It must be something very precious, huh?

128
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,100
Well, I always tell him that I don't know
what he's talking about and refuse.

129
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,220
They really are a pain in the ass.

130
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,540
Is he breathing, Chopper?

131
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,750
Although he's completely
unconscious, he's still alive.

132
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,920
He'll be okay. I can save him.

133
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,270
Just wait a bit... Usopp.

134
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,920
We're gonna go blow that stupid house away!

135
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,950
Hey! Go get more food!

136
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,530
We've got money!

137
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,540
The alcohol today sure tastes good!

138
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,630
I've drawn graffiti on the walls of
people's houses for all these years.

139
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,430
Thanks! So you took my goggles back from him?

140
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,640
Okay, then!

141
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,270
I'll tell you a story about when I bravely
fought Sea Kings in the Calm Belt.

142
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,900
Big ones! They were...

143
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,330
A-And what's more...
I have 8,000 men under me!

144
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,550
That large amount of money... They stole it all.

145
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,260
Nami...

146
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,680
I can't face everyone.

147
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,640
Make sure you beat up every one of them, guys!

148
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,440
So that's what you wanna do?

149
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,570
See? You lose.

150
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,570
Now, go buy some food!

151
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,700
Make sure you buy all the food at
the store, okay?! We've got money!

152
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,000
Dammit. Just you wait and see.
I'll beat you later.

153
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,380
Huh?

154
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,610
What?! What happened?!

155
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,660
Someone's there!

156
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,450
Who the hell are you jerks?!

157
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,250
That's...

158
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,680
That's...

159
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,220
...Straw Hat Luffy!

160
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,870
So you came to get the
money back, huh, you fools?

161
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,160
See all the guys here? What do
you think the four of you can do?

162
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,460
But, well... you're here.
You've got a bounty on your head.

163
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,630
So why don't you leave
that head of yours with us?

164
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,300
He's the captain of that weak long-nosed guy.

165
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,470
He can't be that strong.

166
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,310
Come on, shorty.

167
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,020
Gum-Gum...

168
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,150
Hm?

169
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,070
What're you doing?

170
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,000
He's punching? At that huge steel armor
that even a battleship cannon can't shatter?

171
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What a joke!

172
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,840
If you're just fooling around,
I'll go ahead and crush you!

173
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,610
...Cannon!

174
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,170
H-He punched a hole in that huge armor!

175
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,460
Hey!

176
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,920
W-Wait a sec, you guys! Let's have a talk first!

177
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
Let's have a...

178
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,430
Let's... Let's...

179
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,970
Let's fire cannonballs!

180
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,810
Yahoo!

181
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,690
Three-Sword Style...

182
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,730
...Raven...

183
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,690
...Hunt!

184
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,840
Th-The cannonballs are made of iron, you know!

185
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,930
Even a cannon, too!

186
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,430
Bad news! These guys are seriously bad news!

187
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,940
G-Get out of here!
Get out through the back door!

188
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,110
You started the fight. Don't act pathetic.

189
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,740
Party Table...

190
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,870
...Kick Course!

191
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,510
W-We can't use the back door!

192
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,800
Windows! Get out through the windows!

193
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,640
Rumble...

194
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,350
...Horn Point!

195
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,490
Roseo Colonnade!

196
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,080
W-W-Wait a sec, you guys!

197
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,080
The money, right?!
You want the money back, right?!

198
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,340
The 200 million Berries that
worthless guy had, right?

199
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,340
Unfortunately, that money is no longer here.

200
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,930
Our boss, Franky, took that
money and went shopping.

201
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,890
Since he's buying something
on the black market,

202
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,310
we don't know where he went.

203
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,560
In short, no matter how much
you go on a rampage here,

204
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,770
that 200 million Berries won't come ba--

205
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,400
I'm a goner!

206
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,770
Ahh! Zambai!

207
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,870
That's enough out of you.
It has nothing to do with money.

208
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,080
Yeah... It's too late.

209
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,330
We'll beat you up so bad that
not even your bones will remain.

210
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,670
Not even our bones?!

211
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,920
You idiot! Don't get frightened!

212
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,460
"Not even your bones will remain"

213
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,340
is what we, the Franky Family,
demolition workers and bounty hunters, say!

214
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,510
Show them the Franky House's specialty!

215
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,900
Anything Shot Cannon!

216
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,660
Here they come! Attack them!

217
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,290
D-Don't flinch! Keep firing
until we run out of cannonballs!

218
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,120
There are only four of them!

219
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,810
Hm?

220
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,850
What're those noises? Fireworks?

221
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,770
It's from the northeast! They're coming
from the direction of the Franky House!

222
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,740
Them again? What's the fuss about this time?

223
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,110
Yea... Ugh! Shh! He'll hear us!

224
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,910
Oh, boy, they're getting too carried away.

225
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,790
They really don't show any
restraint when they party, do they?

226
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,750
It's okay once in a while, right?
It's a wonderful day today.

227
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,770
Shall we go follow Franky?

228
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,110
Where?

229
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,070
Drat. Looks like they really
don't know where the money is.

230
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,910
Even if we strangle this Franky guy,
if he already spent the money...

231
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,880
What do we do now? Even if we wait for
him here, he won't be back for a while.

232
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,090
Hey! I finished giving him first aid!

233
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,340
I'd like to take him on a stretcher,
so help me here!

234
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,640
Staying here talking won't get us anywhere.

235
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,930
Let's go back to the ship for now.
We left Nami-san alone there, too, so...

236
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,350
We have the thing with
Robin-chan to deal with...

237
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,810
...and the issues with the ship, too.

238
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,310
Yeah.

239
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,900
Hey, Luffy!

240
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,610
About the ship...

241
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,360
Hm?

242
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,280
I've made a decision.

243
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,130
Let's say goodbye... to the Going Merry here.

244
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

245
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

246
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

247
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

248
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

249
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

250
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

251
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

252
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

253
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

254
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

255
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

256
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

257
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

258
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

259
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

260
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

261
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
Hey, hey, you're taking the joke too far.

262
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,590
I'm not joking.

263
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,840
We'll say goodbye to the Merry here.

264
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Bull! Don't be ridiculous!

265
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,890
Hey, Usopp...

266
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,140
This ship can't be fixed anymore!
She'll sink soon.

267
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,440
--Luffy!
--No matter what you say,
I'm never gonna give up on Merry!

268
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

269
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,650
"Big Fight under the Moon!
The Pirate Flag Flutters with Sorrow!"

270
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
