2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,200
After being separated from his friends,

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,030
Luffy comes to rescue his brother Ace
who has been captured by the Navy

51
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,110
by sneaking into Impel Down - the
greatest prison in the world!

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,540
Luffy is now at level 2 - Wild
Beast Hell with Buggy the Clown.

53
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,980
It is a wild beast of hell!

54
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,720
Damn it!

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,430
Gum-Gum...

56
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,840
...Giant Pistol!

57
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,000
What?! Someone's broken in to Impel Down?!

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,730
That's impossible! No one has ever
broken in all the prison's history!

59
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,480
Did they notice our plan?!

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,310
Transfer the video!

61
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,780
Warden!

62
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,290
Can I see the prisoner now?

63
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,740
Okay, let's go! I'm ready to go!

64
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,460
W-Warden! Don't you realize
how serious this is?!

65
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,880
If you're having trouble on
this floor, I can help you.

66
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,670
Who is that guy?

67
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,510
Long time no see, Straw Hat Luffy!

68
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,890
You helped me out without noticing.

69
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,680
I always pay back my debts.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,140
Who are you?

71
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,440
Oh, that's 3! That means...

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,390
You were on the island with
the Giants! You are San!

73
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,650
No, I'm Mr.Three!

74
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,260
"A Warlord in Prison! Jimbei
the First Son of the Sea!"

75
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,970
To be honest, when I was assigned
to this floor I thought I was dead,

76
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,920
but it's surprisingly peaceful.

77
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,430
It couldn't be any other way.

78
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,390
What kind of floor did you think it would be?

79
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,650
This lowest floor holds the
worst villains with more

80
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,070
than a 100 million berry price...

81
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,370
...or other infamous menaces.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,530
That's why the security here is so tight

83
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,410
and that's why it's called Eternal
Hell -the worst floor for

84
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,030
prisoners to be held on.

85
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,880
Well, the only chance for them
to get out from the deep sea...

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,960
and get sunshine is when
they go to their execution.

87
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,580
Death is maybe easier...

88
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,550
...than spending the rest
of your life in this hell.

89
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,420
Maybe!

90
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,770
Hey! The Warden and Vice Warden
are on their way with Boa Hancock.

91
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:21,480
I wonder why the pirate empress
wants to see "Fire Fist" Ace.

92
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,810
Yeah, he is the most dangerous
prisoner in Impel Down,

93
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,280
I mean, maybe in the whole world now.

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,330
I don't want any trouble.

95
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,300
Speaking of dangerous men, that
guy who is a Warlord like Hancock

96
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,740
who rebelled against Navy Headquarters
is also pretty dangerous.

97
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,800
I am...

98
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,480
...not going to run!

99
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,190
I can't even move to scratch an itch.

100
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,100
They beat you up, huh?

101
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,410
Captain.

102
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,880
It doesn't hurt me, Ace-san.

103
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,120
What hurts me is...

104
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,560
....the fact that I can't take a stand...

105
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,630
...for my beliefs about humanity and justice!

106
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,720
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei
A Warlord of the Sea
(A Whale Shark Fish-man Formerly
With a Bounty of 250 Million Berries)

107
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,680
Jimbei.

108
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,870
I can't die without doing something about it!

109
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,640
I don't give a damn about the title of
Warlord of the Sea! I don't want it!

110
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,190
If it means I can stop this war...

111
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,180
I'd be happy to sacrifice my life!

112
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,730
No wonder we can't reach them!

113
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,450
The jailors' room on level
2 was crushed by a Basilisk!

114
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,080
A Basilisk was beaten?!
Where are those two?!

115
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,250
What's happening on level 2 now?!

116
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,890
I see them!

117
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,190
--Really?--But...

118
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,270
...there's three now.

119
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,600
What?!

120
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,560
"Level 2
Floor of Wild Beasts from Hell"

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,330
It seems like all the wild beasts
on this floor are after us now!

122
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,710
We can't just run forever!

123
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,600
You're right! As soon as we stop
running, we're gonna become dinner!

124
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,220
And while we're busy running,

125
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,220
jailors from other floors are on
their way here to catch us, too.

126
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm tired already...

127
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,180
I don't have time for this!

128
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,450
Gum-Gum...

129
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,370
Chop-Chop...

130
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,310
Candle...

131
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,110
--...Pistol!
--...Cannon!
--...Lock!

132
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,240
Augh! That big centipede just exploded!

133
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,530
It was just made of a bunch of Puzzle
Scorpions! They are extremely poisonous!

134
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,080
They're multiplying!

135
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,530
I told you!

136
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,290
They sure were fooled by my footsteps trick!

137
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,210
They found us, stupid!

138
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,700
Damn it!

139
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,000
By the way, I heard that the boss of
beasts on level 2 looks like a lion.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,930
Is this them?

141
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,810
No! These are man-eating lions with
human-like faces called Manticores!

142
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,140
"Prison Guard on Level 2
MANTICORE"

143
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,140
Once they catch us, they'll
eat us to the bone!

144
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,860
To the bone!

145
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,320
--Key!--What?

146
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,900
Give me the key!

147
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,440
Don't pay attention!

148
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,150
Since they look like humans
they do impressions of people!

149
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,870
--Help me!--It's too painful!

150
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,930
They just learn what prisoners say!
They don't even know the meaning!

151
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,620
I-It's creepy!

152
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,830
--Loincloth! Loincloth!--Strawberry-print
panties!

153
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,340
Who taught them those dumb words?!

154
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Beef Steak!

155
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,470
--What?!--Don't react to it!

156
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,050
Hey you!

157
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,550
You said that you're gonna help us, right?

158
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,580
Of course! Let's join forces
to break out of this prison!

159
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,020
Where can we get down to level 3?!

160
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,030
Huh? Don't you wanna break out?!

161
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,490
I thought that you wanna go up to level 1!

162
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,440
Straw Hat came here to
rescue his brother Ace!

163
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,170
Brother?! "Fire Fist" Ace
is Straw Hat's brother?!

164
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,740
And you came here to rescue him?!

165
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,830
I've no time!

166
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,170
If Ace is being held here, I'm
sure that they put him in level 5!

167
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,470
And he wants to go there?!

168
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,160
No way! That's crazy! I'm not going!

169
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,850
Wait! Tell me where the stairs
to go down are, at least!

170
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,980
The stairs to go down? Oh yeah!

171
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,640
The stairs are connected
between level 1 to 3.

172
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,240
Why don't I use Straw Hat as a bait--to
the beast guarding the stairs!

173
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,200
And then, I can just take off!

174
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,840
All right, Straw Hat! Let's go together!

175
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,470
Count on me, Straw Hat!

176
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,420
Follow me...

177
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,270
Oh no. There's something
here. And what the...

178
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,260
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

179
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,660
It's a guardian of the
stairs called the Sphinx!

180
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,570
"Prison Guard on Level 2
SPHINX
(A Lion with a Human-like Face and Feathers)"

181
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,200
Is it a lion?! Or a grandpa?

182
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,040
--Omelet rice!--Steak!

183
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,970
--Underpants!--Strawberry-print panties!

184
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,180
Thin noodle.

185
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,180
T-Thin noodle?!

186
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,190
Chinese Noodle!

187
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,730
Vegetable noodle!

188
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,230
They taught him mainly names of noodles?!

189
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,230
BBQ pork noodle!

190
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,280
Spicy Szechuan noodle!

191
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,370
Cool dude!

192
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,160
--Who, me?!--Who, me?!

193
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,660
He's very tough!

194
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,310
T-That's gotta be...

195
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,200
The Sphinx is going nuts somewhere!

196
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,220
I knew it! We'll be stuck here forever!

197
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,340
Ground pork noodle!

198
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,600
Hot-pot noodle!

199
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,510
Canton noodle!

200
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,510
I wanna eat Sanji's food! I
haven't had it for long time!

201
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,010
Wonton noodle!

202
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,500
Wonton noodle!

203
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,010
Damn! He's pretty strong!

204
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,330
You know, I don't wanna go
down to the lower levels!

205
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,420
I'm totally with you!

206
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,790
All right! Now, let's form
an alliance to breakout!

207
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm so glad that you are a real escapee!

208
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,600
Alright, let's execute the
"Straw Hat for dinner" plan!

209
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,060
Oh yeah!

210
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,880
Miso flavored noodle!

211
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,950
Salt flavored noodle!

212
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,180
Soy sauce flavored noodle!

213
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,830
Hey, what're you guys doing?

214
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,920
Oops!

215
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,050
H-Here he comes, Straw Hat!

216
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
Gum-Gum...

217
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,180
...Bazooka!

218
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,800
Why did you want to make him angry?!

219
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,280
Oh no!

220
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,020
It's not fair! I wanna go
up higher like you two!

221
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,370
Cold noodle!

222
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,420
I got you, naive animal!

223
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,970
That's just a wax figure that
I made with my Wax-Wax power!

224
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,520
Hot thin noodle.

225
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,850
It's better with Miss Goldenweek's coloring,

226
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,190
but it's enough to fool an animal like you!

227
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,830
Here we go!

228
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,830
Can you tell which is the real me?

229
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,000
Noodle!

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,380
You missed it!

231
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,460
Noodle!

232
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,340
You missed it!

233
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,070
Noodle!

234
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,510
You missed it!

235
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,430
Wow, that's fun! It's like Whack-A-Mole!

236
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,870
--Noodle!--Missed it!

237
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,260
--Noodle!--Missed it!

238
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,590
--Noodle!--Missed it!

239
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,560
That's him!

240
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,690
--Noodle!--Missed it!

241
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,980
Oh, it's not! This one?!

242
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,700
--Noodle!--Missed it!

243
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,730
--Noodle!--Missed it!

244
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,700
--Noodle! Noodle! Noodle!
Noodle! Noodle!--Go get him!

245
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,550
He's playing with Sphinx!

246
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,540
How simple-minded are you, Straw Hat?!

247
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,750
Noodle! Noodle! Noodle!
Noodle! Noodle! Noodle!

248
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,550
Noodle!

249
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,880
You're starting to enjoy this!

250
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,460
They're having more fun than I
expected. I gotta make a break now!

251
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,820
Hey, what are these unusual tremors?!

252
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,970
They must be making Sphinx mad!

253
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,940
Noodle! Noodle! Noodle!

254
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,090
Noodle!

255
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,780
What?! What happened?!

256
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,910
Is it safe to be on this floor?!

257
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,800
Level 3 to monitoring room!

258
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,240
We're hearing big noises from upstairs!

259
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,250
Mr. 3! This is our chance!

260
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,840
The plan is a success!

261
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,370
This wasn't our plan! But let's just run!

262
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,130
Oh?! That must be the door to the stairs!

263
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,430
I'll make a key out of wax!

264
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,550
This is the monitoring room!
We can't get in touch with level 2 yet!

265
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,020
So we don't know what's going on!

266
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,860
Noodle!

267
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,140
Oh no! You stupid beast! You
battered down the floor!

268
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,870
This is level 3! Augh! The ceiling is
crumbling and the beast is about to...

269
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,690
This is not good!

270
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,260
No no! This is the way to level 3!

271
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,190
Sorry, noodles!

272
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,840
I'm known by the government
as a pirate who hates pirates

273
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,580
except for you people.

274
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,380
You hates pirates?

275
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,290
Must be surprising for you, Ace-san.

276
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,230
I visited Whitebeard's ship frequently

277
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,290
but because of my status, I always
traveled under the sea to get there.

278
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,510
Because I like you people.

279
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,900
Ho-hum.

280
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,560
I remember that you almost killed me once.

281
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
I can say the same for you.

282
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,440
I just wanted to do something for him.

283
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,370
Fish-Man Island is peaceful now and it's
all because of the old man Whitebeard.

284
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,120
When pirates go along the Grand Line,
they always pass Fish-Man Island.

285
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,940
Right after the dawn of Great Pirate
Era, Fish-Man Island was in trouble.

286
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,130
Countless human pirates and Navy
who were chasing after them...

287
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,800
...were wreaking havoc.

288
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,730
A large number of Fish-men and mermaids
were kidnapped and sold as slaves.

289
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,100
And just when everyone gave
themselves up to despair,

290
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,480
Whitebeard came.

291
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,820
"I declare that this island
is my territory now!"

292
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:32,290
With just those few words, no one
bothers Fish-Man Island anymore.

293
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,710
What power!

294
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,420
How could I ever forget that day?

295
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,880
And he's protecting other islands
with his name in the same way, too.

296
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,010
It's not right to knock somebody down
just because he's the head pirate!

297
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,540
If he ever got killed, what
will happen to the sea?!

298
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,110
It's clear to everyone that that
time of confusion would come again!

299
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,010
The government must know it, too!

300
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,240
I wanted to stop the war even if it kills me.

301
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,040
I wanted to rescue you, Ace-san.

302
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,010
Jimbei, that's enough.

303
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,260
It's too painful.

304
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,020
I haven't given up hope yet.

305
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,890
I believe that a miracle will
happen and a chance will come.

306
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,310
It looks like there's a lot of fun
going on in the outside world!

307
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,160
It's a now-or-never chance
to defeat Whitebeard.

308
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,240
I can't help getting excited.

309
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,990
You bastard!

310
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,960
You think that you can fell my old man?!

311
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,590
It's not just me.

312
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,670
Kill Whitebeard!

313
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,930
That guy's gonna die? Yee-ha!

314
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,180
That'll be great!

315
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,100
Get me out to the sea!
I'm the one who will kill him!

316
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,650
Let me have a chance, too! I'm
gonna put an end to his era!

317
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,500
Shut up, you assholes!

318
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,420
Jimbei, "Fire Fist," just so you know,

319
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,520
there are dozens and dozens
of silver medalists

320
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,150
in the world who in the end didn't win...

321
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,140
...against Whitebeard and Roger
all holding back their tears.

322
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:06,350
Straw Hat! You're the worst
troublemaker in the world!

323
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,260
Sorry, noodles!

324
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,330
Level 3!

325
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,300
This is Starvation Hell, where
prisoners are given no food or water

326
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,340
and are tormented by extreme heat.

327
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,290
As Luffy and the others roam
this desert-like floor,

328
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,220
they fall into a trap set by a chief guard.

329
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,800
On the next episode of One Piece!

330
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,860
"Chief Guard Saldeath's Trap!
Level 3 - Starvation Hell!"

331
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
