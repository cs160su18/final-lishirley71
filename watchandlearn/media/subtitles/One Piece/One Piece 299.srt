00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,920
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,650
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,440
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,910
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,400
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,880
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,500
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,340
Oh, that's right. I get it!

35
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,140
What is it?

36
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,680
We can save her... As long as they
have me, we can save Robin! Dammit!

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,610
"Dammit"?! You don't have
to get upset or anything!

38
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,610
Let's hurry, Nami-kun!

39
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,030
Don't make me repeat it.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
There isn't even a shred of hope left for you.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,650
I heard some voice in the passage earlier,

42
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,210
but no one showed up after all, did they?

43
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,380
Lucci might be killing him right about now, huh?

44
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,140
It seems that we disagree.

45
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,170
I guess there's no point in discussing it.

46
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,270
I don't have much time, either.

47
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,050
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,740
Stamp!

49
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,470
Whip!

50
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,670
Spear!

51
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm a wolf. I'll keep going
after you until I chew you up.

52
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,970
Oh? You're still alive.

53
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,170
I don't intend to run...
I don't intend to be killed...

54
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,050
And I don't intend to forgive.

55
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,610
Forgive?

56
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,300
Are you sympathizing with Nico Robin?

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,970
A distracted mind just creates
openings during a fight.

58
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,310
If you have time to pity that ill-fated woman,

59
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,880
you should think of a way
to save your neck here.

60
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,070
Watch your mouth.

61
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,160
I'm the kind who heats up with anger.

62
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,170
Its destructive power is just like that of a devil.

63
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,840
Diable Jambe!

64
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,800
What? W-Wait!

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,760
Flambage...

66
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,020
...Shot!

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,990
God creates food...

68
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,410
...and the Devil creates spice.

69
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,680
I guess I made it a little too spicy.

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,320
"Fierce Sword Attacks! Zoro vs. Kaku,
Powerful Sword Fighting Showdown"

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,480
Oni... Giri!

72
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,490
Whoa! Damn that giraffe and Moss Head!

73
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,570
Are they trying to destroy this tower?

74
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,600
This is...

75
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,890
"Gates of Justice"
"Underground passage"

76
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,330
Gates of Justice?

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,890
So I can get there by following this?

78
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,170
I hope Nami-san and Usopp are
already headed to Robin-chan by now.

79
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,650
I have to hurry up too
and bring this #1 key to her.

80
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,470
I'd better get going!

81
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,500
You bitch! Come on already!

82
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
We're finally on the Bridge of Hesitation!

83
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,720
Look, Nico Robin!

84
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,440
You can see the opened
Gates of Justice, can't you?

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,200
It took a long time... It really took a long time.

86
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,940
But I'm finally here.

87
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,040
Once I've gone through those gates,
I can be the Government's...

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,750
No, the world's hero!

89
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,220
The bridge that continues onto the other
side of the doors has indeed risen up,

90
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,170
and is now waiting for
the hero to come and cross.

91
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,650
This is wonderful! Just take a look
at the path to my bright future!

92
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,820
Well, for you, I guess it's the path to hell, huh?

93
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,870
Right? You think so too, right, Nico Robin?

94
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
--No!
--Hey, what're you doing?!

95
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,410
Ow!

96
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,220
Hey! Stop!

97
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,430
You... Enough already, you bitch!

98
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,390
You still don't get it?!
It's pointless to try and struggle!

99
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,240
Do you really get who I am?!

100
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm the world's hero. I'm the
world's hero, you got that?!

101
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,630
You're in the worst situation without a
shred of hope left! I'm different from you!

102
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,920
I have a bright future full of hopes and dreams!

103
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,630
Do you get it, you dumb woman?!

104
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,320
Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

105
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,510
Luffy...

106
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,230
Everyone...

107
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,280
Everyone...!

108
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,280
Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry!

109
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,530
It'll be meaningless if I
can't make it in time! Hm?

110
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,840
I can see something up ahead!

111
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,960
We'll reach our destination
in about ten minutes!

112
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,660
Hurry up and check the formation of all ships!

113
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,920
Yes, sir!

114
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,210
Hey! Stand up already, you bitch!

115
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,220
Now, let's go, Nico Robin!

116
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,760
Is this the exit?!

117
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,610
You... Straw Hat!

118
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,860
Ah! Franky!

119
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,050
What're you doing here, you jerk?!

120
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,240
You idiot! Enough with the attitude already!

121
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,700
I'm on your side right now! Just give it up!

122
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,000
Lucci, huh? So you're having
a tough time against him?

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,960
Where's Nico Robin? I brought two keys.

124
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,500
Shall I give you a hand?

125
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,670
No. More importantly...

126
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,370
...please stop Robin.

127
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,370
You can get to the Gates of Justice
through the doors behind the pigeon guy.

128
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,430
Robin has already been taken away.

129
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,850
I'll restrain him.

130
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,270
Just super leave it to me, you jerk!

131
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,750
I'm saying that if I had to choose,
I like meat better!

132
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,010
And I'm saying it doesn't matter, herbivore!

133
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,150
Hm?

134
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,680
In any case, I'll hurry up and take your key.

135
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,100
If I can't make it in time,
it'll be the same as defeat.

136
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,480
Two-Sword Style... Nigiri...

137
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,950
You get stronger when you
wear a towel on your head?

138
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,490
Who knows...?

139
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,110
Tower Climb!

140
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,010
Tower Climb Return!

141
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,800
Flash!

142
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,010
Ripple!

143
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,810
If you jump, you'll have blind spots.

144
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,180
Giraffe Scythe!

145
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,330
Iron Body. No Blind Spots.

146
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,200
What?!

147
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,640
I've become square with no blind spots.

148
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,590
Shut up! What the hell are you doing?!

149
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,090
You're so naive.

150
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,370
Have you not noticed...?

151
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,470
What?

152
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,500
Giraffes have four legs.

153
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,330
Tempest Kick!

154
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,290
Like I said, are you gonna fight or not?!

155
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,690
Where are you looking?
My attack has already started.

156
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,860
The slash attacks I directed upwards...

157
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,160
...will deflect off the ceiling...

158
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,700
...and pour down on you!

159
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,850
Giraffe Shower!

160
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,490
Iron Body.

161
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,540
Slash attack pellets...

162
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,550
Dammit! I can't block them!

163
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,030
Nose Pistol!

164
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,980
You bastard...!

165
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,790
What a tough guy you are.

166
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,520
I'm flabbergasted.

167
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,570
I've trained my body, you damn gi-riff-raff!

168
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,710
Gi-riff-raff? I am a giraffe!

169
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,280
Gi-riff-raff.

170
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,200
That's wrong! I'm not gi-riff-raff!

171
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,040
--Shut up!
--Hm?

172
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,500
Gi-riff-raff... Gi-riff-raff...

173
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,590
Stop rambling... I could care less!

174
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,300
If you're mocking me, you'll pay for it.

175
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,470
Likewise. You'd better prepare
yourself. Playtime is over.

176
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,010
First, I'm gonna break through... that Iron Body!

177
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,660
You sure do say funny things.

178
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,670
You are going to break through Iron Body?

179
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,150
You think you can do it?

180
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,910
Yeah, of course.

181
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,840
Want me to try?

182
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,720
One-Sword Style...

183
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,610
...Lion Strike!

184
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,480
Tempest Kick!

185
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,880
Dragon Cut!

186
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,740
Would you have been able to cut if it was iron?!

187
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,500
It's my call as to whether or not I
use Iron Body to block your attack.

188
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,840
I see. I guess it's not that simple, huh?

189
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,220
One Gorilla!

190
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,930
Two Gorilla!

191
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,130
Now, bring it on!

192
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,390
Three-Sword Style...

193
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,120
A strength contest this time?

194
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,820
How interesting.

195
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,150
Nose Pistol!

196
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,610
Two Gorilla Slash!

197
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,830
What strength...!

198
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,020
You speak in an arrogant manner.

199
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,680
You're the type who can't even
imagine your own fall, aren't you?

200
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,940
How haughty you are!

201
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,210
So are you!

202
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,570
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

203
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,930
Paper Art.

204
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,770
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

205
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,460
Shave!

206
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,160
Straw Hat!

207
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,720
Tsk!

208
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,720
Tempest Kick!

209
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,320
Weapons Left!

210
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,190
Shave!

211
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,700
What?!

212
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,030
Gum-Gum... Rocket!

213
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,690
What?!

214
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,240
Gum-Gum... Bazooka!

215
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,300
Straw Hat!

216
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,800
Okay, stay like that and don't move!

217
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,740
Wait!

218
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,900
Don't waste your time on this guy. Go already!

219
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,060
I said I'd restrain him, didn't I?!

220
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,150
Restrain him?! But you're barely
holding your own against him!

221
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,130
We should work together and...

222
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:07,980
Franky!

223
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,360
He's my opponent! I'm the
one who has to restrain him.

224
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,800
I'll say it one more time.
Hurry up and go to Robin!

225
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,320
And stop her!

226
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,430
Or she'll be gone forever!

227
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,870
We won't be able to get her back!

228
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,790
You...

229
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,500
Stop! Sea Train!

230
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,330
Give Tom-san back to us!

231
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,630
That's not possible.

232
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,430
I won't let you get away.

233
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,260
Straw Hat!

234
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,430
Hurry!

235
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,440
Go!

236
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,990
You...

237
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,530
Okay!

238
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,570
I thought I said I wouldn't...

239
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,030
...let you get away!

240
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,990
Moon Walk!

241
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,240
Shave!

242
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,580
What?!

243
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,290
Finger Pistol!

244
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,880
I thought I told you.

245
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm your opponent!

246
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,990
I still haven't shown you...

247
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,070
...a giraffe's real wild strength!

248
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,480
Stop talking! Just show it to me.

249
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,960
Sure thing!

250
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,610
Have a good look at the giraffe's power!

251
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,510
Giraffe Cannon!

252
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,540
There's no giraffe like that.

253
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,790
Extreme Nose Pistol!

254
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,210
Giraffe Blast!

255
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,080
It stretched?!

256
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,990
See? What did I tell you?

257
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,230
That long neck is your weak point.

258
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,880
That's not totally true. Tempest Kick!

259
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,260
Spinning White Blade!

260
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,310
It's you who has an opening.

261
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,020
Tsk! Just what kind of creature is he?!

262
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,280
I won't miss next time.

263
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,740
Giraffe Cannon!

264
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,320
Wha...

265
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,330
Oh, shoot! I pushed my neck in so
much that my arms and legs got longer!

266
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,290
What kind of setup does your body have?!

267
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,290
It's as if flour got crammed in
and got pushed out as noodles.

268
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,970
Just like a pasta machine!

269
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,000
Hm?

270
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,940
Pasta Machine!

271
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,680
Don't just make that into an attack name!

272
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,890
I like my long neck, but long arms
and legs are easy to use, too.

273
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,440
I'm an expert at fighting who turns
an unexpected situation into a chance.

274
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,400
Just watch... The technique
using this long reach...

275
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,040
Giraffe Blast!

276
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,820
You couldn't come up with a new attack?!

277
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,280
Enough is enough!

278
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,690
Three-Sword Style...

279
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,660
...Dragon Twister!

280
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,750
Iron Body!

281
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,050
How powerful...!

282
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,800
Shave!

283
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,010
Moon Walk!

284
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,310
What?

285
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,520
He jumped into the upper floor!

286
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,310
Pasta Machine!

287
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,110
Thanks for waiting!

288
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,190
Arms, legs, and neck...
If I can control their reach at will,

289
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,040
I can swing my swords vigorously!

290
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,970
I'm a Four-Sword Style swordsman.

291
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,710
I can now make full use of the giraffe's power!

292
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,170
You no longer have any chance against me!

293
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,600
The giraffe's power is very strong...

294
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,680
You can store your obstructive neck away...

295
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,310
You use the Four-Sword Style...

296
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,990
Hmph!

297
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,360
What?!

298
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,280
He stopped my sword attacks?!

299
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:37,000
None of those things...
can be a basis for my defeat.

300
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,680
I'll use my strongest Tempest Kick, Sky Slicer,

301
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,390
and cut down that useless retort of yours!

302
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,890
You have nowhere to escape.

303
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,770
Hardships are fine by me!

304
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,390
I choose to walk the path of Asura!

305
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,390
What's that illusion?!

306
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,650
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,970
"Demon God Zoro! An Incarnation
of Asura Born from Fighting Spirit"

308
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
