2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,940
Those're cannonballs!

25
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,820
Hmm?

26
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,190
Huh? That was way off!

27
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,480
What are you guys doing?

28
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,540
Cannon practice!

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,890
Awesome! You hit it on your first try!

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,920
Whadya think?! I'm awesome when
it comes to aiming! Impressed?!

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
It's settled! You're our sniper!

32
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,430
Come out, you damn pirates!

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,130
Hmm? That voice...

34
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,430
What the... What the... Who are you?!

35
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,630
"Sea"

36
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,730
Are you nameless pirate
wannabes trying to kill my partner?!

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,630
I dunno what's going on,
but stop breaking our ship!

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,050
L-Lost by a hair...

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,240
"Famous Cook!
Sanji of the Sea Restaurant"

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,880
Say, where're you taking me to today?

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,500
To the most wonderful
restaurant in the world.

42
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,170
Don't tell me... there's one
in the middle of the ocean?

43
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,120
Here's to your beauty...

44
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,740
Well, just wait until you see it...

45
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,220
Hey, if it isn't Johnny!

46
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,050
What?

47
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,180
B-Big Bro Zoro!

48
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,110
Wh-Why are you on
a pirate ship like this?!

49
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,770
Is something wrong?
Yosaku isn't with you?

50
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,480
Well...

51
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,180
What? Does Zoro know that guy?

52
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,540
What's going on?

53
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,470
Y-Yosaku is...

54
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,770
He's sick?

55
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,040
Although he was full of life
up until a few days ago,

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,330
now he keeps getting pale
suddenly and then fainting!

57
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,390
I have no idea what's causing it...

58
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,160
In the end, his teeth fell out

59
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,670
and his old wound opened up
and started bleeding.

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,400
I didn't know what to do any more...

61
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,160
so we were on a rocky island
letting him rest quietly. But then...

62
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,680
...a cannonball came
flying from this ship...

63
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,690
--W-We're sorry!
--W-We're sorry!

64
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Sorry doesn't cut it...

65
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,840
Isn't that right, partner?

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,900
Big Bro... Is he going to die?

67
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,240
Are you all stupid?

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,230
What'd you say?!

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,240
--Wh-What're you doing?!
--Ouch!

70
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,660
If you mock my partner's
death, you'll pay for it--

71
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,260
Luffy! Usopp! Remember we
have limes in the storage?

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,870
Are you listening?!
Bring them here. Now!

73
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,980
--Y-Yes ma'am!
--Y-Yes ma'am!

74
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,100
--Out of my way!
--Out of my way!

75
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,020
It's scurvy.

76
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,820
Scurvy?

77
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,110
If we weren't too late,
he'll be fine in just a few days.

78
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,830
R-Really, Big Sis?!

79
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,580
Big Sis, is he really...

80
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,620
Stop... calling me that.

81
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,140
In the past, it was a hopeless disease
that accompanied sea journeys.

82
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,790
--Here, drink it. Drink a lot.
--Here... drink more. Drink more.

83
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,490
But the cause was simply a
deficiency of plant-derived nutrients.

84
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,280
Ships in the past
didn't carry fresh fruits

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,550
and vegetables since
they weren't storable, so...

86
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,830
Okay, now. Put them all in his mouth.

87
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,970
Now he'll be fine.

88
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,980
You're amazing!

89
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,800
You're like a doctor!

90
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,940
Well, I always thought you were good.

91
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,870
Yeah, you're right. She is.

92
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,700
You should know at least that much!

93
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,240
You could die if you don't!

94
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,750
Wha...

95
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,260
--Yaay! Yaay! Yaay!
--Yaay! Yaay! Yaay!

96
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,960
All those nutrients revived me!

97
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,670
All right, partner!

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,630
There's no way you can
recover this quickly!

99
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,760
Sorry for not
introducing ourselves first.

100
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,220
My name is Johnny.

101
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm Yosaku.

102
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,140
The pirate bounty hunter duo!

103
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,120
We used to be
colleagues of Big Bro Zoro.

104
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,930
Glad to make your acquaintance.

105
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,350
I never thought that
I'd see you guys here...

106
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,160
But again, we're surprised...

107
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,150
We never imagined that the pirate
hunter Zoro became a pirate...

108
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,460
Yeah, I know...

109
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Big Bro...

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,140
H-Hey, partner?!

111
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,890
This is a lesson.

112
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,850
Yeah. There're pitfalls like this

113
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,120
when you travel on
the sea for a long time...

114
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,460
Which means on the ship,
we have to consider

115
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,410
the distribution of nutrients
using limited kinds of food...

116
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,630
When we think about it carefully,
it's a necessary ability...

117
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,230
A necessary ability, huh?

118
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,130
Okay, then! A seafaring cook!

119
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,950
--What?
--What?

120
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,210
Let's go find a seafaring cook!

121
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,800
Aha! Then we'll be able to eat
yummy food even on the ship!

122
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,770
Exactly!

123
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,100
If you're looking for a cook like that,
there's a perfect place for that.

124
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,480
All right! Where's it?

125
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,330
But this place is close
to the Grand Line, and...

126
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,700
you hear rumors there about the hawk-
eyed man you've been looking for...

127
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,910
We'll head...

128
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,280
north-northeast!

129
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,380
Yes!

130
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,840
All right!

131
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,090
Our destination is...

132
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,690
...the Sea Restaurant...

133
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,630
...Baratie!

134
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,660
--Whoa!
--Whoa!

135
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,120
What do you think, everyone?!

136
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,000
Whoa! It's a huge fish!

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,240
How lovely!

138
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,290
That's pretty funky!

139
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,350
Right?! Just like I told you, right?!

140
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,510
Wh-What the...

141
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
At a place like this...

142
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,320
A Navy ship...

143
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,730
S-Surely they're not gonna
shoot at us, are they?

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Hmph! What an unpleasant
bunch we've run into...

145
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,770
Wh-When did they...

146
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,830
I've never seen that pirate flag.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,950
Darn it!

148
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,290
We're not pirates!

149
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,890
I'm Iron Fist Fullbody,
Lieutenant at Navy Headquarters!

150
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,720
Hey, who's your captain?!
Come out and state your name!

151
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm Luffy!

152
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,420
I'm Usopp!

153
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,180
We just made our pirate flag
the day before yesterday!

154
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,100
And I'm the one who drew it!

155
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,070
Hmph! Oh, you're just...

156
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,860
Hmm?

157
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,410
You two over there,
I remember seeing you before.

158
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,920
If I remember correctly, you're a bounty
hunter duo going after small fish.

159
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,870
Wh-What?!

160
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,490
So you finally got caught by pirates...

161
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,590
W-We are...

162
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
That's a laugh.

163
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,680
C'mon, let's get going.

164
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,380
Okay.

165
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,550
You think small-time bounty hunters
would go after these guys?!

166
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,380
Hmm?

167
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,870
Now, let's go to the restaurant.

168
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,540
They're an eyesore. Sink them.

169
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,770
--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sir!

170
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,030
He ignored us.

171
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,530
Next time we see him,
we'll have to shut him up!

172
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,520
What is this...

173
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,550
They're wanted pirates, Big Sis Nami--

174
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,490
In other words, if we defeat them,
we'll get the reward money.

175
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,290
A very profitable business,
don't you think, Big Sis?

176
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,060
W-We're in trouble.
They're aiming at us!

177
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,140
Leave it to me!

178
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,290
Gum-Gum...

179
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,880
Slingshot!

180
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,020
Ow...

181
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,490
Owner!

182
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,370
Are you all right, Head Chef Zeff?!

183
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,250
Owner, are you all right?!

184
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,670
Hmm? What happened?
Is our reservation okay?

185
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,000
Head Chef Zeff, are you really okay?

186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm saying it's not okay!

187
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,360
Never mind, just get back to the
restaurant already! Get to work!

188
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,430
B-But Owner, you're...

189
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,410
You idiots! Do you
want me to get angry?!

190
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,370
Feeding customers is a cook's job!

191
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,620
Are you fools trying to put
my restaurant out of business?!

192
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,660
We brought him in.

193
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,280
He's the one responsible.

194
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,060
I-I-I-I'm very sorry!

195
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,640
Ahhh! Your leg...

196
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,140
Idiot!!

197
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,530
This didn't happen just now.

198
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,110
O-Oh, then it was like
that from the beginning...

199
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,740
But you gave me
bruises all over my body.

200
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,990
The medical fees and the repair
charges for the ship will cost you a lot!

201
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,020
I won't ask you to reduce the charges.

202
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,140
Oh?

203
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,660
But...

204
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,560
I don't have money!

205
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,530
You talk very candidly.

206
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,350
Well, if you don't have money, you
have no other choice but to work here.

207
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,450
Yeah, I'll make proper amends.

208
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,280
You'll do chores unpaid for a year.

209
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,970
Okay! Chores unpaid for a year!

210
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,690
I'll let you off the hook with that.

211
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,350
A-A year?! A-A year...

212
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,370
You mean a year?!

213
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,660
What's taking Luffy so long...?

214
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,330
Yeah...

215
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,180
Maybe they'll make him do
chores for a month or so...

216
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,100
He should've made it the Navy's
fault instead of being foolishly honest.

217
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,060
Hey, look.

218
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,000
Just as I thought, the man
sitting there is Lieutenant Fullbody.

219
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,130
He's a lieutenant at Navy Headquarters.

220
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,960
Huh?

221
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,710
He's gorgeous. How elegant...

222
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,200
It's amazing. Everyone's looking at you.

223
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, they're admiring you.

224
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,570
This is good!

225
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,200
Th-This flavor...

226
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,690
Hmm... This scent...

227
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,820
This may be the scent of the soil
of Micquo of the North Land...

228
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,920
Bitter with plenty of body, a tad sour...

229
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,800
This wine is...

230
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,160
Iturutz Burger Stein!

231
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,850
Aren't I right, waiter?!

232
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,210
That's...

233
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,130
damn wrong, sir.

234
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,380
Your soup is getting cold.

235
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,000
Please eat it while it's hot.

236
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,050
By the way, I'm Sanji, the Sous Chef.

237
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,450
All the waiters ran off as of yesterday.

238
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,460
You really shouldn't laugh.

239
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,370
But he looked so confident...

240
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,960
Do you know a lot...

241
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,840
...about wine?

242
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,870
Well, yeah...

243
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,380
...although it seems my sense of
taste isn't working well today...

244
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,750
Hey, what's going on?

245
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,300
I'm sure I requested the owner to serve
us that wine when I made a reservation.

246
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,310
What do you mean by that?

247
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,980
Please reduce it to a week.

248
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,520
You talk very candidly.

249
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,080
Two weeks!

250
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,190
Hey! You wrecked my restaurant and
injured me, the Head Chef, seriously.

251
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,960
You can't settle that with just
one or two weeks of unpaid work.

252
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,540
I've decided! Three weeks!

253
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,750
Don't talk so...

254
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,060
...candidly!

255
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,430
No!

256
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,610
Hmm?

257
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,770
I've patiently waited
ten years to become a pirate.

258
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,720
I definitely don't want to
be stuck here for a year!

259
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,850
Hmm?

260
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,360
Okay, I've decided.

261
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,380
I'll get you to let me off the
hook in a week. So I've decided.

262
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,660
Oh? If you value time so much,

263
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,040
I'll tell you what you can
do to settle it quickly.

264
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,380
Ow!

265
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,080
Leave one of your legs here.

266
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,220
No!

267
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,380
Ha! You sure talk very candidly!

268
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,960
Tap, tap... tap...

269
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,930
Yaay! Yaay! Yaaaaay!

270
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,260
Waiter!

271
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,870
Hmm?

272
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,080
Didn't I tell you that I'm not a waiter?

273
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,150
But my, how beautiful you are!

274
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,650
Say, Miss, would you like to have
some wine with me over there?

275
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,360
Hmm?

276
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,120
Hey! Do you serve soup
with bugs in it to customers?!

277
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,570
Bugs?

278
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,690
What the hell is this bug?!

279
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,840
Hmph! This will make this
restaurant's reputation drop sharply.

280
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't know...

281
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,760
...since I don't know much about insects.

282
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,320
Don't mess with me!!

283
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,360
You could've eaten it if you
took that bug out, couldn't you?

284
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,960
It took three full days to
cook it, skimming the scum...

285
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,380
Aren't you acting a bit
too big for your britches?

286
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm a customer! I'm paying you!

287
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,640
Please stop, Fullbody-san!

288
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,480
Shut up!

289
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,900
F-Fullbody-san...

290
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,460
Can money...

291
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,120
satisfy your hunger?

292
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
What'd you say?

293
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,870
I'm asking, "Can it...
satisfy your hunger?!"

294
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
No!

295
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,550
No! No!

296
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,840
Don't think that you can survive in
this world by repeating "No," kid.

297
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,560
No!

298
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,020
So candid...

299
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,630
F-Fullbody-san...

300
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,020
Sanji...

301
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,450
Sous Chef!

302
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,050
Hmm?

303
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,160
A fight?

304
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,060
Don't... waste food.

305
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,100
At sea, provoking a cook is

306
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,740
the same as committing suicide.
Remember that.

307
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

308
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

309
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,940
before someone else could
beat me to it

310
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:52,550
If the world is going to change

311
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:59,550
before I can even attain my dream

312
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:06,630
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

313
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:20,010
so that my memories won't fade

314
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,680
I wonder if Luffy's working hard.

315
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,690
I bet he's causing trouble.

316
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,480
Yeah, he doesn't seem a helpful hand.

317
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,690
What'd you say?! That's not nice!

318
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,480
Hey, have you found a
cook who might join us?

319
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,080
Yeah, I found him! It has to be him!

320
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,950
On the next episode of One Piece!

321
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,370
"Unwelcome Customer!
Sanji's Food and Ghin's Debt"

322
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,550
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
