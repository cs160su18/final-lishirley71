2
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,920
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,470
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,470
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,190
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,710
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,390
Shall we go follow Franky?

24
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,520
Where?

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,690
Drat. Looks like they really
don't know where the money is.

26
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,910
Even if we strangle this Franky guy,
if he already spent the money...

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,160
What do we do now? Even if we wait for
him here, he won't be back for a while.

28
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,040
Staying here talking won't get us anywhere.

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,340
Let's go back to the ship for now.
We left Nami-san alone there, too, so...

30
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,630
We have the thing with
Robin-chan to deal with...

31
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,170
...and the issues with the ship, too.

32
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah.

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Hey, Luffy!

34
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,350
About the ship...

35
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,850
I've made a decision.

36
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,230
Hm?

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,940
Let's say goodbye... to the Going Merry here.

38
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:07,910
"Big Fight under the Moon!
The Pirate Flag Flutters with Sorrow!"

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,660
Ah!

40
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,750
Hey! Usopp woke up!

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,590
Really?! Good!

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,590
Now we can relax a little.

43
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,550
Hey! Usopp!

44
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,980
Robin-chan isn't back yet...

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Seriously, don't worry us so much!

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,700
She's right. To think that you marched
in by yourself... That was so reckless.

47
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,580
You were lucky that you didn't die.

48
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,990
Think a little before you act.

49
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,540
Look who's talking!

50
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,290
Just because I'm so good-for-nothing...

51
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm sorry...

52
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,880
Really... I'm ashamed! Guys!

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,890
That money was so crucial to
us and yet, I let it... I let it...

54
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,980
Hey, hold on a sec! Calm down!

55
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,350
I-I get it, so let me go!

56
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,900
But... the huge amount of money we got,
after all that we went through...

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,150
Usopp, you should still be in bed.

58
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,990
Hey, listen to Chopper.

59
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,780
Then, as I was afraid...

60
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,990
...the money won't come back?

61
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, we won't know for sure
until this Franky guy comes back.

62
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,170
I see... I'm sorry.

63
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,210
Well, even if we don't get it back,
we still have the 100 million Berries.

64
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,430
So that's okay. Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,510
It's not okay about the money!

66
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,980
--Nami...
--Ah... Sorry.

67
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,560
No, that's okay.

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,940
But Luffy... What about the ship?
What about the Merry?

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,650
Can we somehow have her repaired
with that remaining 100 million?

70
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,610
We're lucky that we can have her
repaired in such a first-class shipyard.

71
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,290
In order for her to be able to travel in
the seas ahead, I'd like her to be stronger.

72
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,250
I want her to be repaired perfectly.

73
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,210
Say, does it look like those guys will
repair her if we pay 100 million Berries?

74
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,590
Does it, Luffy?

75
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,800
Er... well...

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
Usopp, about the ship...

77
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,220
I decided to get a new ship.

78
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,220
What?

79
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,020
I'm sorry that I made the
decision without consulting you.

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,350
But I've already made my decision.

81
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,820
The Going Merry took good care of us,
but our journey with her ends here.

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,250
And...

83
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,710
I took a look at the catalogue
that Ice pops gave us.

84
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,550
While checking the ships in it, I noticed
that there're quite a few kinds.

85
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,390
If we get a used one, 100 million will
allow us to buy a bigger ship than Merry.

86
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,260
Wait.

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,810
Wait... Wait a sec. You're taking
the joke too far. That's ridiculous.

88
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,600
Right?

89
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,610
See? Chopper took it seriously.

90
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,240
Seriously, what'll we do with our captain?

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,530
Say something to him, Nami.

92
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,920
Well... does that mean that we don't
have enough money for the repair?

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,460
Because I got that 200 million stolen by them,

94
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,550
w-we're now short on money, right?

95
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,670
Hey, that's what's going on, right, Luffy?

96
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,180
The cost of a first-class shipyard
would also be first-class, so...

97
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,640
No! That's not it!

98
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,220
Then why?! Spit it out! Are you
trying to be considerate to me?!

99
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,310
I'm not! It has nothing to do
with that money being stolen!

100
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,310
Then why are you saying stupid stuff
like that we're gonna get a new ship?!

101
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,730
Hey, stop it, both of you!

102
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,570
What good will fighting do?
Calm down and talk!

103
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,450
How can I calm down when he
starts saying stupid stuff?!

104
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,830
Hey! This is an important matter.
Don't get so worked up.

105
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,750
She's right, Usopp. You need
to rest, or you won't get better.

106
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,500
Who cares about my body?!

107
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,750
How can I be quiet when our captain
casually says we'll get a new ship?!

108
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,800
It's not casual! I made the
decision after agonizing over it!

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,890
What and how did you agonize over
to make this kind of decision?!

110
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,680
How dare you talk about it
while waving this stupid thing?!

111
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,810
What'd you do that for?!

112
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,140
It's an eyesore.

113
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,230
Hey, Luffy, if it wasn't because we
got our money stolen, then why?!

114
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,030
Luffy, why don't you say it?! Hey!
Why are you keeping quiet?!

115
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,440
If you're not being considerate
to me, then don't hold back!

116
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,280
Say it! I won't accept it unless
I hear good reason! Hey!

117
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,240
The Merry can no longer...

118
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,800
What... did you just say?

119
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,590
Don't make me repeat myself.

120
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,640
The Merry can no longer be repaired.

121
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,930
No matter what we do, she won't be fixed.

122
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,190
Otherwise, I wouldn't say something like that.

123
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,690
This ship?! Are you talking about this
ship that we're on board right now?!

124
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,070
That's right. This ship will sink soon.

125
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,490
What're you talking about, Luffy?

126
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,500
It's the truth. They told us at the shipyard.

127
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,250
They said that she can't
even reach the next island.

128
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,050
Oh, really... She can't, huh?

129
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,420
So you were persuaded by
strangers you just met today

130
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,130
and gave up just like that?

131
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,760
What'd you say?

132
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,470
Just because first-class
shipwrights told you that this is it...

133
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,640
...you gave up just like that?!

134
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,110
We've traveled together all this time!

135
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,530
We made it through all sorts
of waves and battles together!

136
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,440
She's our dear friend!

137
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,570
Are you gonna abandon her in a place like this?!

138
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,330
Is that how little this ship means to you, Luffy?!

139
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,300
You shouldn't shout like that, Usopp.

140
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,340
--Sorry, but step aside.
--What?

141
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,630
I'm not done talking with him.

142
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,590
Usopp...

143
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,270
Then can you make an accurate assessment?!

144
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,360
We don't have a shipwright on this ship.
That's why we asked them to check her!

145
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,230
Fine! We don't have to
ask those guys to fix her!

146
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,650
I'll repair her, as I always have!

147
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,370
That's how we've continued
to travel in the first place.

148
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,240
Okay, let's start now. Hey, help me, guys!

149
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,080
Hey, wait, Usopp.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,710
Oh, yeah, we don't have enough lumber.
I'll go buy some at the shipyard.

151
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,710
Now, we're getting busy.

152
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,170
You're not a shipwright, are you, Usopp?!

153
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,630
Hey, Luffy!

154
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,890
Yeah, you're right. So what?!

155
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,970
But I don't trust irresponsible
shipwrights who easily give up on a ship

156
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,560
just because it belongs to someone else

157
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,810
by taking advantage of
their position as craftsmen!

158
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,440
Usopp...

159
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,030
This must be a lesson that we should
protect our own ship by ourselves.

160
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll never... give up on this ship!

161
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,320
Are you guys stupid or what?!

162
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,580
You probably got fooled by the shipwrights'
convincing argument, didn't you?!

163
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,460
The Luffy I know would've believed
in the strength of the Merry first

164
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,290
rather than buying those guys' sales talk!

165
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,000
Such a clear-cut answer that sounds

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,380
like one made by an old man
who understands everything...

167
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,390
How can you make a decision like that,
suddenly acting all captain-like?!

168
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,600
I misjudged you, Luffy!

169
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,470
Wait a sec, Usopp! Luffy, too, first--

170
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,430
Stay out of this, Nami!
This is something I decided!

171
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,850
I won't change my opinion.
No matter what you say now,

172
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,900
we're gonna get a new ship!
We'll say goodbye to the Merry here!

173
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,360
Don't be ridiculous! I won't allow that!

174
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,950
Listen, Luffy! It's not like everyone
can live looking ahead like you do!

175
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,490
I can't just leave our wounded friend
here and move on to the seas ahead!

176
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,160
Don't be ridiculous! Even if she's a friend,
ships and humans are different!

177
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,710
They're the same! Merry has
the strength to live left in her!

178
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,840
--Considering how you are, aren't you
excited thinking about the new ship
--Hey, that's enough, you guys!

179
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,170
--while pretending to be concerned about Merry?!
--You can't have a conversation
if you're worked up like that!

180
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,470
Enough, already!

181
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,050
Luffy!

182
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,970
Don't think that you're the only
one who feels pain over this!

183
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,470
Everyone feels the same way!

184
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,060
If so, there's no way you'd
decide to get a new ship!

185
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,860
Fine! If you dislike what I decide
that much, then get off this--

186
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,440
Sanji...!

187
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,950
You idiot... What were you about to say?!

188
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,500
Cool down! Be careful about
what you say! Got that, Luffy?!

189
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,010
Sorry. I just...

190
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,890
That's okay, Luffy. That's how
you really feel, isn't it?

191
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,810
What'd you say?!

192
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,490
Go ahead and cut off useless friends
one after another and move on.

193
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,110
If you're gonna abandon the Merry...

194
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,070
...why don't you do that to me, too?!

195
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,390
Go ahead and cut off useless friends
one after another and move on.

196
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,850
If you're gonna abandon the Merry...

197
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,850
...why don't you do that to me, too?!

198
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,310
Hey, Usopp. Don't say stupid stuff like that.

199
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,650
No, I'm serious.

200
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,780
I've been thinking about this for a while.

201
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,860
To be honest,

202
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,790
I've been thinking that I can't keep
up with your monstrous strength.

203
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,040
Like today... I can't even watch over money.

204
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,960
I'll just keep causing you guys trouble.

205
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,220
You don't need weak friends, right?

206
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,680
Luffy... you're the man
who'll be king of the pirates.

207
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,270
But I don't have to go that high up.

208
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:06,240
Thinking back, when I was about to sail out,
you guys asked me to join you.

209
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,240
What're you talkin' about? Get on already.

210
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,910
We're friends now, aren't we?

211
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,460
That's all that's tying us together.

212
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,710
We don't have to travel together
when we have a difference of opinion!

213
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,720
Hey, where're you going, Usopp?!

214
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,850
Where I'm going is my own business.

215
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,060
It has nothing to do with you guys anymore.

216
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,020
I'm...

217
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,730
...leaving the gang.

218
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,250
Usopp...

219
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,960
Oh, no...

220
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,470
Hey! What're you doing, Luffy?!

221
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,470
Is it okay to let him go like this?!

222
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,970
Hey! Go after him!

223
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,850
Stop him now!

224
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,690
We've come this far together.
Is it okay to part like this?

225
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,900
Usopp is our precious friend.

226
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,660
Stop him!

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,080
Hey, Luffy... You are the captain, right?!

228
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,380
Why aren't you saying anything?

229
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,340
Usopp!

230
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,590
Wait! It shouldn't be like this!

231
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,390
Hey! Turn around!

232
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,010
Hey! Come back!

233
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,270
Don't go! Usopp!

234
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,070
Come back!

235
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,190
Luffy...

236
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,220
Luffy! I can't go along with you anymore.

237
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,220
Sorry to cause you trouble until the end.

238
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,400
It's true that the ship
belongs to you, the captain.

239
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,070
So fight me...

240
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,700
Monkey D. Luffy!

241
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,250
Fight a duel with me!

242
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,920
What? What? Er, hey... what're you saying?!

243
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,020
At 10 o'clock tonight, I'll come back here.

244
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,930
Then we'll fight a duel over the Merry!

245
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,770
I'll defeat you and take the Merry.

246
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,560
That's...

247
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,150
...the end of the bond
between you guys and me.

248
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,040
What's with you?! Stop this nonsense!

249
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,370
Why do you have to fight
a duel with your friend?!

250
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,710
If you give it a little time,
you two will cool down, right?!

251
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,720
Usopp, too. He just got flared up
because things were moving quickly.

252
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,930
Now that we've come this far, we can't go back.

253
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,300
That's not true!

254
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,640
You can apologize to him and talk it over again!

255
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,650
Like I said... it's no longer possible.

256
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,440
Why not?

257
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,200
Usopp isn't stupid enough to risk
his life under the influence of anger.

258
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,660
Besides, if talking it over
would change his opinion,

259
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,620
this wouldn't have happened.

260
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,670
If you get it, leave me alone.

261
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,500
Luffy...

262
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,340
I'm saying, the Franky Family
came here this afternoon, right?!

263
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,220
Huh? So what?

264
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,010
Why didn't you beat them
all up beyond recovery then?!

265
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,020
If you had, Usopp wouldn't have
been attacked and felt guilty!

266
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,520
Then, instead of going shopping,
you should've stayed and fought them!

267
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,940
I went to get necessary food as your cook!

268
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,490
Stop fighting at a time like this!

269
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,120
There's been enough fighting.

270
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,160
Don't fight over what's done.

271
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,330
Nami-san...! But this idiot is...

272
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,800
Chopper... Didn't you... go follow Usopp?

273
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,680
I wanted to continue treating his wounds,
but he turned me away.

274
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,980
He got a place to stay in town.

275
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,440
He said...

276
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,440
He said, "You and I are no longer friends,
so go back to the ship!"

277
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,370
All that fun time up until this
morning seems like a dream.

278
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,750
If something is happening
to Robin on top of this...

279
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,630
I feel like... the gang is falling apart.

280
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,060
The Straw Hats, huh?

281
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,400
Well... I somehow feel restless tonight.

282
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,690
It's 10 o'clock, the promised time.

283
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,280
Usopp is coming.

284
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,960
You guys, don't leave the ship.

285
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,380
Got that?!

286
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,220
--There he is!
--Usopp!

287
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,040
So you didn't get cold feet, huh?

288
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,790
You'd better be sure you're not going
to regret this, no matter what happens.

289
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,870
This is the duel you wanted.

290
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,590
Of course. You'd better fight seriously.

291
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,460
I'll turn the tables on you.

292
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,010
I've already figured out how to defeat you.

293
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

294
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

295
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

296
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

297
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

298
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

299
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

300
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

301
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

302
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

303
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

304
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

305
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

306
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

307
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

308
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

309
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

310
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,300
Stop it. It's ridiculous for friends to fight a duel!

311
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,510
Once what we protect becomes
different, we're no longer friends.

312
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,760
It's over between us!

313
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,430
Don't say that. Luffy, you restrain yourself, too!

314
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,850
Precisely because we're all friends,
be prepared and watch quietly!

315
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,390
Come on, Usopp!

316
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

317
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,900
"Luffy vs. Usopp! Collision of Two Men's Pride"

318
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
