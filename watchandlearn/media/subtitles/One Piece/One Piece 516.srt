2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,400
Realizing the importance of friendship,

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,440
Luffy went back to Marineford at
Dark King Rayleigh's suggestion.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,280
And the rest of the Straw Hats got a message
through the news

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,450
about Luffy's mysterious behavior.

63
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,660
Luffy doesn't do these kinds of things.

64
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,370
I know there is a catch.

65
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,330
Oh yeah! I got it, Luffy!

66
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,550
I got it now! Okay! Okay!

67
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,760
I see. That's what it is.

68
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,180
I see, Luffy!

69
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,930
I got it, Luffy!

70
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,480
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

71
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,060
Honestly! He's not thinking
about how we feel - how selfish!

72
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,820
I see!

73
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,200
Oh, is that what it's all about?

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,670
I understand!

75
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,870
See you at Sabaody Archipelago in 2 years!

76
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,560
"Luffy's Training Begins! To the
Place We Promised in 2 Years!"

77
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,550
A FEW DAYS AGO - IN THE CALM BELT

78
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,930
Here he comes.

79
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,400
Jimbei! Thank you for everything!

80
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,280
No, I should be thankful to you!

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,250
Although I begged you to set
me free from Impel Down,

82
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,210
I'm ashamed of myself for being still alive.

83
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm sorry!

84
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,760
I told you to not say such a thing.

85
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,900
If it weren't for you, Jimbei,

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,890
I probably couldn't have
made it to the Navy HQ.

87
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,120
So show your face.

88
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,820
You're right.

89
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,910
There may still be something I
can do for you again in the future.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,540
In any case, see you at the
Fish-Man Island in 2 years!

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm looking forward to the day when
you and your friends visit us!

92
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,500
Yeah!

93
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,130
Take care!

94
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,060
Luffy, I'm glad that you
got back on your feet.

95
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,310
Your hands, your smile, and all
of your casual gestures make...

96
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,900
...my heart flutter and twinge!

97
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,950
If nothing is done, I could
die from this fluttering!

98
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,100
I feel dizzy...

99
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,540
Are you okay, Hancock?

100
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't worry!

101
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,760
We'd like to go to the training spot.

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,340
Can you take us there now?

103
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,470
I-I see!

104
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,050
Hey, set sail for Ruskaina!

105
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,630
Yes, Snake Princess-sama!

106
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,100
A DESERT ISLAND NORTH WEST OF
THE MAIDEN ISLAND - RUSKAINA

107
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,270
This island is perfect.

108
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,990
It has 48 seasons a year, so it
changes weekly. It's a harsh island.

109
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,440
Oh, I see.

110
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,870
Luffy!

111
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,790
I'll bring food for you everyday
from the Maiden Island!

112
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,840
What?! Really, Hancock?!

113
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,990
Could you bring that
specialty-gorgon-something?

114
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,970
That was so good!

115
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,720
O-Of course!

116
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,430
Wow, Snake Princess-sama!

117
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,240
I can bring anything you want in any amount!

118
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,220
And that was the 10th time
that you said my name!

119
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,190
I-It means we're engaged now!

120
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,780
No, it doesn't! And why are you backpedaling?

121
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,660
You said that you were married a while ago!

122
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,540
Hancock! I don't want you
to spoil him like that!

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,170
While Luffy-kun is training,
women are not allowed to be here!

124
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,480
What?!

125
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,720
What gives you the right to decide
those kinds of things, Rayleigh?!

126
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,090
I'll turn you to stone
depending on your answer!

127
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,560
We can find things to eat in
mountains, forests, rivers and sea!

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Not his nose! Stop, Snake Princess!

129
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,020
If you can't live like that,
you should not be a pirate!

130
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,950
It's all for Luffy-kun's benefit!

131
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,170
Did you just say "it's
all for Luffy's benefit"?

132
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,160
Yes.

133
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,340
It's all for Luffy...

134
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,040
Then I'll be patient!

135
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,400
But, Rayleigh, this island
is truly dangerous!

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000
If anything goes wrong...

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,760
That's why it's good for his training!

138
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,550
Just pray for him if you feel concern.

139
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,010
Shall we go, Luffy-kun?

140
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,430
Yeah!

141
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,230
--Luffy!
--Good luck!

142
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,940
Yeah!

143
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,440
Luffy, please be safe!

144
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,660
You ought to remember this tree.

145
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,110
Even savage beasts stay away from it.

146
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,330
It's the only safe area on this island.

147
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,950
Hmm, it's kind of funny looking!

148
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,390
Now, we are the only humans on this island.

149
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,430
Look at this vast wilderness!

150
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,400
I heard there was a country
here a long time ago.

151
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,740
But humans have lost the
struggle for survival.

152
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,860
Nature here is relentless
and the land is rough!

153
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,470
I smell a great adventure!

154
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,400
There are a lot of savage
beasts! They're uncountable!

155
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,160
There are about 500 living things here
beyond your capabilities now.

156
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,410
You have to get stronger, or
you can't even sleep at night.

157
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,250
How are you able to know
about them and their number?

158
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,960
This is something that concerns you.
You must obtain this power.

159
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,340
The power called Haki!

160
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,130
Haki?

161
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,100
Oh no! Something is here, old man Rayleigh!

162
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,770
Hey, it's right behind you!

163
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,440
Listen, Luffy-kun.

164
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,610
Haki is a
latent power that everybody has!

165
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,030
It's an elephant! 5 times bigger
than usual! What an elephant!

166
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,450
Presence, fighting spirit, intimidation...

167
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,580
It's no different from the
senses that normal humans have.

168
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,210
However, most of them
don't realize their power

169
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,960
or don't know how to bring
them out, until the very end.

170
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,640
Having no doubt!

171
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,970
That makes you strong!

172
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,640
Watch out!

173
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,150
Second Gear!

174
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,780
Jet Pistol!

175
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,430
Damn... What an elephant!

176
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,120
He's not just strong, but fast!

177
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,740
Watch very carefully!

178
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,300
There are two prominent types of Haki!

179
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,470
Watch out!

180
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,920
Don't worry.

181
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,300
He's trying to hit me with
his nose from the right.

182
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,000
It's the power to feel other's
presence more strongly,

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,360
called Observation Haki!

184
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,920
Awesome...

185
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,740
If you enhance this power, you can
tell where your invisible enemy is,

186
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,000
and how many there are, and
what their next move will be.

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,370
A left leg kick!

188
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,500
Mantra.

189
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,050
They call it Mantra on
the Sky Island--Skypiea!

190
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
Oh, damn!

191
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,140
Next, the Armament Haki.

192
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,880
This power is the same as
wearing invisible armor.

193
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,730
Old man!

194
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,410
I-I've seen it before.

195
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,830
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

196
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,840
If the armor is hard enough, it can
be used as the offensive power.

197
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,470
Ouch! I'm a rubber man
so I shouldn't feel pain!

198
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,180
This is an efficient part of this power.

199
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,550
Other than exploiting their weak
point, this Armament Haki is...

200
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,970
...the only effective countermove
against Devil Fruit eaters.

201
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,440
Logia-type Devil Fruit eaters

202
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,370
seem almost invincible
because of their fluid body

203
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,160
but you can hit them solidly.

204
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,750
Oh, that's why you could touch Kizaru!

205
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,130
And that means I could land a blow

206
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,090
against Smokey of the Navy or Aokiji!

207
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,310
You can transfer this power to your weapon.

208
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,310
Have you ever seen the Kuja's arrow?

209
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,810
Yeah...

210
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,270
It was almost like a steel arrow!

211
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,770
Observation Haki, Armament Haki...

212
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,820
Those are two types of Haki.

213
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,780
However, there are a few rare people
who can use another kind of Haki.

214
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,750
Watch.

215
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,980
That was the power to intimidate your enemy!

216
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,670
Conqueror's Haki!

217
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,900
The people who are the biggest names...

218
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,430
...often have this power.

219
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,140
However, unlike the other two,

220
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,540
you can control the Conqueror's Haki
but you can't train yourself to use it.

221
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,020
That's because it's the
owner's spirit itself.

222
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,290
You can enhance it only
by developing yourself!

223
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,770
Oh, that's what you did at the auction house!

224
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,300
You know what it is.

225
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,100
You have awakened the ability
of Conqueror's Haki already.

226
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,610
Don't do it!!

227
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,200
But don't use it until you become
capable of controlling it fully.

228
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,850
Because you would intimidate
innocent people around, too.

229
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,590
Hm? What's wrong?

230
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,430
Amazing!

231
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,320
A crewmember of the King of the Pirates

232
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,730
can beat these beasts
without even touching them!

233
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,110
Do you respect me a bit now?

234
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,570
Uh-huh!

235
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,700
But I've seen those Haki
powers at various places!

236
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,920
Shanks, grandpa, Eneru, Aisa,

237
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,210
Hancock and the Kuja warriors!

238
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,190
Yes, I bet you have.

239
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,670
But learning
how to use Haki is not easy.

240
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,920
Uh-huh!

241
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,730
Usually, we'd need more time
but you're well qualified.

242
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,150
I'm gonna teach you the basis of
Observation Haki, Armament Haki,

243
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,320
and even Conqueror's Haki in 2 years.

244
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,240
Uh-huh.

245
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,620
Most people would lean towards one
type as their preference dictates.

246
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,170
They find which one they prefer
and strengthen that one.

247
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,180
But if you can enhance each of them,

248
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,290
you can expand what you're capable of.

249
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,160
Uh-huh, I got it.

250
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,510
Now,

251
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,800
as a trainer, I'm not easy, Luffy!

252
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,970
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it!

253
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,240
--Now then, let's...
--Oh, give me a minute!

254
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,420
If I'm correct, he said that
this is the only safe place.

255
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,610
The pirate Straw Hat Luffy
will be on hiatus for a while.

256
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,910
Ace! Luffy!

257
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,910
We gotta set out to sea someday!

258
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,790
Let's get out of this
country and live freely!

259
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,540
Let's become stronger and
become pirates someday!

260
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,970
I'm gonna become a pirate and
defeat others and become infamous!

261
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,220
It'll be the only proof of my life!

262
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,790
I got it! Alright then...!

263
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm gonna become...!

264
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,580
Oh yeah!

265
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,500
This one, too!

266
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,920
Everybody...

267
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,020
Luffy!

268
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,170
Luffy!

269
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,320
Luffy!

270
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,010
Luffy!

271
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,140
Luffy!

272
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,260
Luffy!

273
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,270
Luffy!

274
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,520
Luffy-san!

275
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,920
Luffy!

276
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,660
Hey, hurry up! Let's begin!

277
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,000
Alright!

278
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,370
Let's do it, old man!

279
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,980
No, you must say "Thank you, Rayleigh-san."

280
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,530
No, Professor Rayleigh... Or Master...?

281
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,430
Thank you, Rayleigh!

282
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,310
Okay, whatever!

283
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:43,990
We're going to gather up all our dreams

284
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,570
and set out in search of something to find

285
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,330
ONE PIECE

286
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,720
Compasses only cause delays

287
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

288
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:18,180
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

289
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,110
When it comes to personal storms,

290
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:30,420
simply ride aboard someone else's biorhythm

291
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,080
and pretend they aren't there!

292
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,500
We're going to gather up all our dreams

293
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,500
and set out in search of something to find

294
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,390
A coin in my pocket, and
do you wanna be my friend?

295
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,000
We are, We are on the cruise!

296
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,500
We are!

297
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,160
Zoro! Usopp! Sanji! Nami!

298
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,490
Chopper! Robin! Franky! Brook!

299
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,990
And Ace! Sabo!

300
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,580
To take a pledge again...

301
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,040
I'll get stronger!

302
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,480
We are!

303
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,740
Two years after the War of the Best,

304
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,840
the time comes for the Straw Hats to reunite

305
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,350
with the new powers they've
gained through their training!

306
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,350
Their sights set on the last sea

307
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,810
in the Grand Line, the New World,
Luffy and friends set out once more!

308
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,410
On the next episode of One Piece!

309
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,900
"The Beginning of The New Chapter!
The Straw Hats Reunited!"

310
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,550
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
