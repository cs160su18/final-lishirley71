00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,160
Riding on Rocketman,

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,410
the Straw Hat Pirates have infiltrated
the Enies Lobby main island.

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,000
By the way, where's that idiot
who rushed out by himself?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,190
Beats me... This island isn't small,
so if we are to find him...

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,640
What was that?!

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,890
That's definitely where he is!

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,560
As for Luffy, who went ahead of the others,

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,310
he still hasn't been able
to reach the courthouse.

10
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,160
He jumped onto the tree!

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,160
Those jerks! This is endless!
I can't move forward!

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,140
What's the matter?

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,290
Take the reins.

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,960
Hm? You guys...

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,890
When you see... those guys, tell them...

16
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,260
"You guys're fired."

17
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,600
Sure will.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,020
Jump on to it!

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,810
We won't let you!

20
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,770
Half Knot Air Drive!

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,850
Ahhh! S-Some Watchdogs were taken out!

22
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,540
We'll take care of these guys.

23
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,070
Meanwhile, Robin and Franky
were facing a desperate situation.

24
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:04,680
Look! Both triggers for the
ancient weapon's revival are here!

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,900
Do you get it? The winds the entire
world over are blowing in my favor.

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,450
A power strong enough to give me control
over any large country I might desire

27
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,870
is in my hands now!

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,540
Why did Aokiji give you the
authority to exercise Buster Call?

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,500
Huh?

30
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,640
You're in no position to ask me
questions, you insolent woman!

31
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,990
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,870
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

33
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,830
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

34
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,750
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

35
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,430
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

36
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,390
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

37
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,770
we will be able to make it through

38
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,770
Always!

39
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,610
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

40
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,800
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,700
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

42
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,210
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

43
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,640
We can't stop here

44
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,590
Around the world

45
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,760
Start me up!

46
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,680
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

47
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,870
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,570
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

49
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,760
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

50
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,550
Brand New World

51
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,910
Start me up!

52
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,580
If I hadn't recognized
the value of your existence,

53
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,010
it would've been practically worthless!

54
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,600
So you should appreciate me.

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,620
You, the repugnant kin of Ohara,
the land of devils...

56
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,900
Nico Robin...

57
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:31,350
"Robin Betrayed! The Motive
of the World Government!"

58
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,140
Now, listen good.

59
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,740
From here on, you'll suffer pain so severe

60
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,380
that you will wish many
times for death to come,

61
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,570
so prepare yourself.

62
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,070
We'll hurt you, use you,
and throw you away into the sea.

63
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,700
That is how deeply sinful
your existence itself is!

64
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,400
Oh, that's right. I got a call earlier.

65
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,570
They reported that some morons
have infiltrated our island

66
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,330
just to get back worthless trash like you.

67
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,300
Don't tell me...!

68
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,190
Well, they should all be caught by now.

69
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,900
It's Straw Hat Luffy and his crew.

70
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,820
Why do those kids...

71
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,870
They seemed no better than trash in
front of the 10,000 Enies Lobby soldiers.

72
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,880
Well, we're about to send a ship to the prison.

73
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,870
They are a good gift.

74
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,960
I'll take them to Impel Down
together with Cutty Flam.

75
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,980
Wait! That's not what we agreed upon!

76
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,660
In return for my cooperation, you were
supposed to let them escape safely!

77
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,610
What are you flying off the handle for?

78
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,510
Lucci! Tell us exactly what the
condition that we offered her was.

79
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:38,680
That the six Straw Hats, excluding Nico Robin,
would leave Water Seven safely.

80
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,480
Yeah, that's right.
There's no mistake in that, right?

81
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:56,120
They came here after leaving
Water Seven safely, right?

82
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,580
What?

83
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,500
Don't tell me... that you're going to
break the deal using such twisted logic!

84
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,960
They're hopeless scum. They don't
have a shred of morality in them.

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,380
Huh? What'd you say?

86
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,180
Shut up, you trash!

87
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,240
To start with, we don't even have to
keep our promises with you criminals!

88
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
Take this! Take this! You bastard!

89
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,450
You too!

90
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,520
Don't get so cocky, you bitch!

91
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,200
Even the Navy openly uses
tricks to capture pirates!

92
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,590
You dirty coward...

93
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,260
To think that you're still talking back...

94
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,250
You've been betraying people all this time.

95
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,430
Don't think that you can
choose an ideal way to die now.

96
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,520
You guys can all die together.

97
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,080
All are powerless before
the supreme power of justice.

98
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,640
After him! Don't let him get away!
The enemy is alone! Surround him!

99
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,050
Stop!

100
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,050
Get outta my way!

101
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,340
Don't get in my way!

102
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,510
You bastards!

103
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,990
Commander! He's really scary!

104
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,570
Don't flinch, you idiot! Go!

105
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,410
Commander!

106
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
That... looks like a dead end.

107
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,870
You'd better still be there...

108
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,520
Robin!

109
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,520
Well then, guards, keep these two in chains.

110
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,600
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,420
Don't ever take the Sea Prism Stone
handcuffs off of Nico Robin, okay?

112
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,230
We'll take Cutty Flam to Impel Down
and Nico Robin to Navy Headquarters.

113
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,060
As soon as the escort ship is ready,

114
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,310
we'll go through the
Gates of Justice and sail off.

115
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,470
Yes, sir! Understood, sir!

116
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,020
Also... let me tell you guys one thing.

117
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,040
Cutty Flam is violen--

118
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,340
--He's biting into my head! Hey, Kalifa!
--So Straw Hat showed up?

119
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,320
--That's sexual harassment.
--Yeah...

120
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,610
--Hey! Hey! Someone! Someone! Help! Hey!
--A call came in earlier. Chapapa.

121
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,130
--What're you doing?! Hey!
--The Chief was so upset,
it was almost embarrassing.

122
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,670
--Let the Chief go!
--But the report said

123
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,520
--Give up already, you bastard!
--that there were only five casualties then.

124
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,380
Hm?

125
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,010
The receiver is off.

126
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,680
Don't give us trouble! Walk already!

127
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,120
You guys go back to your rooms
and take it easy for the time being.

128
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,860
Thanks to this, it's a sure thing that we,
CP9, will see our status rise incredibly.

129
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,380
Why don't we drink a toast on the ship?

130
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,340
I don't feel like drinking a toast...

131
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,140
...since I'm not interested
in status or authority.

132
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,710
What?

133
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,680
Our justice exists in the World Government.

134
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,520
So long as the Government
recognizes you as CP9's commander,

135
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,670
we just fulfill our duty with perfection, that's all.

136
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,110
We don't have to support your ideology.

137
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,820
Th-That's a sound argument.

138
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,790
Then what is it that you seek?

139
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,670
Blood... perhaps.

140
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,390
As long as we belong to CP9,
even killing can be justified.

141
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,100
They give me the creeps.

142
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,820
They're, indeed, the only group
of assassins in the Government.

143
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,490
What dependable guys my subordinates are.

144
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,410
As long as I have them, I feel like I can't lose!

145
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,470
"Tower of Law"

146
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,480
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

147
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,710
Hey, what's that commotion?

148
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,540
Something is coming!

149
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,680
All right, Sodom, Gomorrah!
Keep charging ahead!

150
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,520
Dammit! So they're the pirates who
broke open the main island's gate?!

151
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,140
Fire! Keep firing!

152
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,870
Ribbit, ribbit!

153
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,020
If you don't wanna die, get out of our way!

154
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,480
Take this! Take this!

155
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,280
Withdraw briefly and restore formation!

156
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,450
You're mere pirates! Don't get so cocky!

157
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,840
Be prepared, pirates!

158
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,210
Nooo!

159
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,220
I'm gonna eat you!

160
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,170
Don't get on without permission!

161
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,230
Things are going smoothly! Good thing
we've got you guys on our side!

162
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,770
We're counting on you to
get us to Luffy, King Bulls!

163
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,430
There are still so many...
This is endless, dammit.

164
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,710
Hm?

165
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,780
I got boxed in!

166
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,830
He's headed your way!

167
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,250
It's Straw Hat! Capture him!

168
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,560
Don't let him go any further!

169
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,810
When I have to hurry up and find Robin...!

170
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,420
I can't move forward like this!

171
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,500
Attack him from both sides!

172
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,050
He ran to the side! Chase him!

173
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,980
Dammit! He escaped to the rooftop!

174
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,670
Hold it!

175
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,200
Boy, they're stubborn! There's no end to this!

176
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,090
We're not gonna let you get away!

177
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,990
Just give up!

178
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,040
Well then, I'll go in one breath!

179
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,620
Gum-Gum...

180
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,660
We're not gonna let you get away!

181
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,960
Capture him!

182
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,500
...Rocket!

183
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,470
See ya!

184
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,890
Dammit! That damn pirate!

185
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,430
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

186
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,280
Don't let the pirates go any further!

187
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,930
Slay them!

188
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,940
Bring down every single one of them here!

189
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,230
Fire! Send the Navy packing!

190
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,570
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

191
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,250
You... bastards!

192
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,470
Uh-huh... Uh-huh, uh-huh...

193
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,000
Got it.

194
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,530
And, when the brothers Sodom
and Gomorrah were going to die

195
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,940
in a Sea King's stomach, the Franky
Family saved them and said to them,

196
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,530
"We're full, so we're not gonna eat you guys."

197
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,030
Since then, they've pledged loyalty
to Franky, who saved their lives.

198
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,790
Well, it was just that they just happened
to be in the stomach of the Sea King

199
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,830
that the Franky Family was eating, right?

200
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,510
Probably.

201
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,870
Well, whatever...

202
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,350
But would you watch where
you're going? You make me nervous.

203
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,660
He says, "I'll be faithful to Big Bro
Franky for the rest of my life!"

204
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,440
He must be really happy that
someone understands his language.

205
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,270
He's asking, "By the way, was it
okay that the guy with the mask

206
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,400
didn't get on with you guys?"

207
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,560
--What?!
--Hm?!

208
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,030
--What?
--Hm...?

209
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,120
What?! I-I can't find Sogeking anywhere!

210
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,770
Why?! Why?!

211
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,020
Did he fall off?

212
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,150
No... Come to think of it,
he wasn't riding with us from the start!

213
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,800
Don't tell me he ran...!

214
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,260
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

215
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,090
You bastard! Stop blocking the path!

216
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,480
Get out of our way already!

217
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,150
If you want to go through here, beat me first!

218
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,660
Get out of our way!

219
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,290
I'm not gonna make it so easy!

220
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,660
Battleship Cannon!

221
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,260
Dammit! It's only three men! Do something!

222
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,180
You're strong when you fight, right?

223
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,270
Can you beat them?

224
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,600
Yes, I can!

225
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,410
When unsure, anyone can be weak.

226
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,380
There's no limit to their strength
when they know it's okay to save her!

227
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,300
We'll bring down the whole place!

228
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,760
There's a technique that I wanna try, too!

229
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,520
He'll definitely...!

230
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Bring down that rope guy!

231
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,150
Not gonna happen!

232
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,020
Shrouds and Ratline Knot!

233
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,990
Oh, shoot!

234
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,700
This is a dead end. Give up.

235
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,080
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

236
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,370
L-Lieutenant Commander!

237
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,540
There's trouble!

238
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,500
--What's the matter?!
--Straw Hat Luffy...!

239
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,960
We lost Straw Hat Luffy!

240
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,510
How could that be possible?!
How many guards do you think there are?!

241
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,130
But we can't find him anywhere!

242
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,140
Don't tell me... he's already
inside the courthouse?!

243
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,730
No, sir! We haven't let even
a single bug through here!

244
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,520
Find him! Find Straw Hat at any cost!

245
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,620
Hmph!

246
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,160
That must be the last building.

247
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,750
All right.

248
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,300
But there's no path.

249
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,250
Although it's a bit far, I guess I'll try jumping.

250
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,990
What the heck?

251
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,550
Air Door.

252
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,480
Ah! You're that bull guy
who was with the pigeon guy!

253
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,650
The actual situation seems quite
a bit different from the report...

254
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,230
Hey! How'd you do that?!

255
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,110
That was amazing! Is that a magic trick?

256
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,950
...although I did think that there was
no way there'd be only five casualties.

257
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,280
Boy, that was a big surprise!

258
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,450
Since the start of the World
Government, it's unprecedented...

259
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,880
...for a man to step this far
into the Government's entrance.

260
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,270
Get out of my way, bull.

261
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,400
How long are you planning to keep fighting?

262
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,040
Until I die.

263
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,130
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

264
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,050
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

265
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,180
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

266
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

267
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
We'll become No. 1

268
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,310
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

269
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,520
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

270
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,690
an era created by risking everything

271
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,820
We always try our best, let's go!

272
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
If we want to achieve glory,

273
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,200
now is the time--don't be afraid

274
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,120
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

275
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,080
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

276
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,080
We can take off with unknown powers

277
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,340
We don't fear, and we don't waver

278
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,050
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

279
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,090
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

280
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,060
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

281
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,310
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

282
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,310
Charge ahead

283
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,190
Let's start running towards tomorrow

284
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,190
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

285
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,450
Get out of my way.

286
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,290
Don't you get what it means to
attack the World Government?

287
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,670
The world this, the Government that...

288
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,040
It's not my problem.

289
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,080
You guys already have no future!

290
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,390
We just came here to get Robin back!

291
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,680
On the next episode of One Piece!

292
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,300
"Give Robin Back! Luffy vs. Blueno!"

293
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,720
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
