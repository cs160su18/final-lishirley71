2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,690
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,000
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,350
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,060
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,680
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,140
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,200
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,940
How the Black Cat Pirates have fallen...

25
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,590
Right?!

26
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,520
U-Us, feeble?!

27
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,340
Zoro!

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,610
Thanks!

29
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,330
Tiger Trap!

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,470
Get up!

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,610
Nami, you jerk!

32
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,660
Klahadore! Stop this!

33
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,040
Run away, Kaya!

34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,750
I devoted myself to you...

35
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,830
For so long!

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,550
Yes, it was all so that
I could kill you today...

37
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,210
Damn you!

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,770
If you hate getting hit that much,
I got a hundred more punches for you!

39
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,240
"Beat Kuro! Usopp the Man's
Tearful Resolve!"

40
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,710
What was that?!

41
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,890
What did he do?!

42
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,090
It looked like his arm stretched!

43
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,290
Get real!

44
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,750
He sent Captain Kuro flying!

45
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,960
I leave the rest to you!

46
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,220
I'm gonna get me some treasure!

47
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,090
--The Usopp Pirates have arrived!
--The Usopp Pirates have arrived!

48
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,790
You guys!

49
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,510
Stay away!

50
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,670
Say your prayers, butt-ler!

51
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,410
It's punishment time!

52
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,920
Lousy pirate!
Disrupting this village's peace!

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,980
S-Stop!

54
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,210
--Darn you!
--Take this!

55
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,320
You brats! What are you doing?!

56
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,290
What're those runts doing?!

57
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,650
Stop that, you guys... Stop!

58
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,360
Alright! We'll let you off with just that!

59
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,740
Now Captain Kuro is really mad!

60
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,290
Those stupid brats!

61
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,410
Captain!

62
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,940
I knew it! You were fighting, Captain!

63
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,490
Why didn't you tell us?! That's unbare!

64
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,610
No! You mean "unfair"!

65
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,270
Who cares about that?! You guys
just gotta get out of here! Run!

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,140
No!

67
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,220
We're gonna fight, too!

68
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,160
The Usopp Pirates will
be shamed if we run!

69
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,290
You idiots! Get out of here, now!

70
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,550
Captain!

71
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,080
That hurt a bit...

72
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,760
That's quite a strange
technique you have there...

73
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,910
I take it you have Devil Fruit powers?!

74
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,370
Yep! I ate the Gum-Gum Fruit!

75
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,330
I'm a rubber person!

76
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,130
What?! A Devil Fruit?

77
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,220
He's dangerous!

78
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,820
They really do exist?!

79
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,190
I thought he seemed strange!

80
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,890
I see. A rubber person. So I didn't
hallucinate his arm-stretching...

81
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,650
Jango!

82
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,390
Yeah?

83
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,970
I'll handle the boy.
You take care of Miss Kaya.

84
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,350
As we planned, have her write a will...

85
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,280
...then kill her!

86
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,000
And those three little ants...
They're an eyesore!

87
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,890
I'm on it.

88
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,460
Stop. I can't let you pass.

89
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,860
Butchie!

90
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,270
Cat...

91
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,470
...astrophe!

92
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,660
Not again!

93
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,050
He's on a completely
different level than before!

94
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,510
Crap!

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,780
Kaya!

96
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,740
Dammit...

97
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,920
I'm out of strength...

98
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,490
Dammit... Dammit! Dammit...

99
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,870
D-Damn...

100
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,420
Usopp Pirates!

101
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,070
--Y-Yes, sir?!
--Y-Yes, sir?!

102
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,860
Listen to me!

103
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,480
We're not going to run!

104
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,150
Not after they did this to you!

105
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,800
We're going to avenge you!

106
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,710
Protect Kaya!

107
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,920
Listen closely!

108
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm giving...

109
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,030
I'm giving you the most
important task there is now!

110
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,140
Take Kaya and get away from here!

111
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,060
Don't tell me you can't!

112
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,380
That was the reason we
formed our pirate group:

113
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,510
to become men who protect
what's important to us!

114
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,280
Usopp-san...

115
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,720
That's... a direct order...

116
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,250
--Yes, Captain!
--Yes, Captain!

117
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,000
Hurry, Kaya-san!

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,950
--This way! This way!
--This way!

119
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,090
He sure knows how to talk all big.

120
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,100
He basically just told 'em to run away...

121
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,700
The woods are like our backyard!

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,480
O-Okay...

123
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,750
Jango!

124
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,700
I wound up gawking!

125
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,330
The fools! They can't
possibly escape me--

126
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,920
Howdya like that?!

127
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,040
Damn you!

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,090
Go after them, you fool!

129
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,720
Y-Yeah, okay!

130
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,840
How pointless.

131
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,310
I know very well just
how weak Kaya is...

132
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,200
She'll never escape Jango.
If you want to help her,

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,650
go right ahead.

134
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,970
If you can get past this hill alive, that is.

135
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,420
Butchie!

136
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,080
You already lost to me once!
I told you not to get in my way!

137
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,330
Move!

138
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,070
W-What's that sound?!

139
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,110
Who knows? Ol' Jango is
probably tearing the place up.

140
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,580
Why not go and see for yourself?

141
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,170
Though it may already be too late...

142
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,540
Damn you...

143
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,790
Don't you even have a shred of pity?!
You lived with her for 3 years!

144
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,930
No. I already told you,

145
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,980
Kaya is nothing more
than a pawn in my plan.

146
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,840
Once she's dead, then I'll
express some gratitude.

147
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,410
Damn you...

148
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,860
What a helplessly evil guy!

149
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,910
I don't plan to help him, though!

150
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,870
Usopp!

151
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,820
Go to them!

152
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,300
We'll take over here!

153
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,620
Leave it to us!

154
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,640
Oh? You can still move?
How impressive.

155
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,370
Shut up...

156
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,410
I refuse to let you... have your way!

157
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,860
You went and betrayed the villagers'--
and Kaya's-- feelings...

158
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,810
I refuse to let you
have your way anymore!

159
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,230
Usopp!

160
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,650
D-Dammit...

161
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,530
I... can't... move...

162
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,120
You really are a riot!

163
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,520
I betrayed them, you say?!

164
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,620
Cut the crap! This was
all part of the plan!

165
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,200
A kiddie pirate captain like you
has no place to talk all-knowingly!

166
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,340
Just stay on the ground there.

167
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,790
Though, even if you did
catch up with Jango,

168
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,890
you'd be no match for him anyway.

169
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,100
This way is probably safest for you!

170
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,940
Even if I am no match...

171
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,020
Even if I am no match for him...
I will protect them!

172
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,410
I'm captain of the Usopp Pirates...

173
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,970
...and a brave warrior of the sea!

174
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:39,490
I won't let you lay a
finger on the village!

175
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,770
What's with him?

176
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,560
He's yellin' somethin'!

177
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,400
Check it out, he's cryin'!

178
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,190
What's so funny?!

179
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,790
Luffy!

180
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,910
Me and Usopp are gonna chase
that hypno-freak! That a problem?!

181
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,860
Nope! Hurry!

182
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,110
T-Thanks...

183
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,460
I'd actually be much faster by myself,
but they're inside some woods.

184
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,630
I'm gonna need your
directions to catch up to him.

185
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,800
Hold it, you two. Who gave you
permission to pass this hill?

186
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,480
I did!

187
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,440
Go! Zoro! Usopp!

188
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,210
And another!

189
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,070
Gum-Gum Spear!

190
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,190
Darn! He disappeared again!

191
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,570
Oh, well! They're past the hill, at least!

192
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,990
Before fighting, I have
one thing to ask you.

193
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,950
Why is an outsider like you butting
into this village's business?!

194
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,070
Because there's a man in this
village I don't wanna let die!

195
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,280
How simple. Are you okay
with that being why you die?!

196
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,820
Yep! I'm not gonna die, though!

197
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,550
I'll make sure you do!

198
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,620
Gum-Gum Whip!

199
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,210
...and Pistol!

200
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,720
You're making me yawn!

201
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Why, you...

202
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,020
Damn... He cut my mouth...

203
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,170
That straw hat guy's
insanely strong, and yet...

204
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,280
T-That's Captain Kuro for ya!

205
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,860
--Get 'im!
--Hurray for Captain Kuro!

206
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,030
--Captain Kuro!
--You're awesome, Captain Kuro!

207
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,930
Don't call me that name!

208
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,500
Do you still not get it?!

209
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:17,070
This plan is so I can be completely
rid of the name "Captain Kuro"!

210
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm tired...

211
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:27,260
Devising plans everyday for you
men who only care about mayhem...

212
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,310
Being relentlessly attacked by
government dogs and bounty hunters...

213
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,930
I was absolutely sick of it all!

214
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,390
The navy, huh?

215
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,270
This is the third time this week...

216
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,950
It can't be helped. We're doing
stuff that makes people chase us.

217
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,190
Plus you've made quite
a name for yourself...

218
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:00,470
Yes... That name is
what draws them to us.

219
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,140
That's why I'm giving
up being Captain Kuro.

220
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,260
That's pretty funny. But it's no use.

221
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,890
I think the navy'll keep
following you until you're dead.

222
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,430
I am going to die.

223
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,150
It would seem that
piracy just isn't for me...

224
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,250
B-But you're this ship's captain!

225
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,420
You can be captain!

226
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,810
I'm sick of this tumultuous lifestyle.

227
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm... going to kill myself for all to see!

228
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,600
Captain Kuro!

229
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,540
Captain!

230
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,500
Captain!

231
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,400
How many vessels?

232
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
J-Just one!

233
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,510
What should we do, Captain?!

234
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,710
Should we blast 'em back?!

235
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,950
Lower a small boat.

236
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,750
Huh?!

237
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,150
A boat!

238
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,990
Vice-Captain Jango!
Captain Kuro just--

239
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,320
Yeah, I know.

240
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,830
"Yeah"?! It's way too reckless
for him to go there by himself!

241
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,530
Don't tell me he's turning himself in?!

242
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,480
H-Huh?!

243
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,780
The cannon fire stopped...

244
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,270
What's goin' on?!

245
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,730
This is creepy...

246
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,270
Dock with their ship.

247
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,020
B-But...

248
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,110
Just do as I say, damn it!

249
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,120
Y-Yes, sir!

250
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,370
Hey, get ready to fight!

251
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,370
I see... So that's why...

252
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,200
Hey, you.

253
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,700
Y-Yes?! What is it?

254
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,890
It was nice knowing you
for this short time...

255
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,110
T-The marines...

256
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,990
They've been wiped out!

257
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,640
Now, then...

258
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,860
Let's begin the plan...

259
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,880
Hey, now. Pull yourself together.

260
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,260
I was kind enough to
leave you alive, you know...

261
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,320
S-Shut up...

262
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,210
I-I'm not gonna beg for my life...

263
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,040
F-Finish me off, damn you...

264
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,870
That's a good look.

265
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,430
If you can howl that much with a
shattered jaw, then that's perfect!

266
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm giving you, a nameless,
low-ranking soldier, a treat.

267
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,400
Accept it gratefully...

268
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,870
The head of Kuro,
Man of a Thousand Plans!

269
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:27,110
Your name is Captain Kuro.
Your name is Captain Kuro.

270
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,020
This atrocity was your doing.

271
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,840
One, two, Jango!

272
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,670
My name is Captain Kuro.
This atrocity was my doing.

273
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,080
And you're the man
who caught Captain Kuro.

274
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,120
Return to base and execute this man.

275
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,110
One, two, Jango!

276
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,960
I'm the man who caught Captain Kuro!

277
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,070
You're doing it again, Vice-Captain!

278
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,660
Perfect...

279
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:05,640
With that fake gone, Captain Kuro
will disappear from the world.

280
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:15,270
And when my plan today succeeds,
my goal will be fully achieved...

281
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,020
Money and peace of mind will be mine.

282
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,250
Do you understand, boy?

283
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,400
I cannot allow this plan
of three years to fail!

284
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,700
My plan will not be disrupted!

285
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,830
Seems you can do
more than just stretch!

286
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,430
That's right! I've toughened
myself up, to be a pirate!

287
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,820
You're "tired"?!

288
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,290
You're not fit to be a pirate if having
a name on the seas scares you!

289
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,970
My ambition is much greater than yours!

290
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

291
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

292
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

293
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:52,540
If the world is going to change

294
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:59,550
before I can even attain my dream

295
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:06,620
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

296
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:20,000
so that my memories won't fade

297
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,510
Do you think Kaya-san and
the others managed to get away?

298
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,850
Those three are with her.
She should be fine.

299
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,120
Yeah, huh? She won't get lost
like someone else I know.

300
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
Are you talking about me?!

301
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,580
Who else is there?!

302
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,020
What're you talking about?!
You used to bounty-hunt while lost!

303
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,320
Don't put it like that!

304
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

305
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,020
"Protect Kaya! The Usopp
Pirates' Great Efforts!"

306
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,380
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
