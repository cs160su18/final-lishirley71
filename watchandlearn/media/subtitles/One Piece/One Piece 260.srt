2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,490
Long-nose!

3
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,010
Here goes! Try dodging this!

4
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,570
Ramen Kenpo!

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Multi-Noodle Spank!

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,430
Hands and kitchen knives
are sacred to cooks.

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,560
So it's my policy
not to use them in a battle.

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,600
But if this is a kitchen...

9
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,370
...and my enemy is foodstuff,
then it's a different story.

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,160
I'll show you...

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,080
...the exceptional way

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,120
that a first-class cook
handles kitchen knives!

13
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,970
What...

14
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,930
...the hell...

15
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,160
...are you?!

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,470
What's the matter, Ramen Kenpo guy?

17
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,990
You don't seem to be
as lively as you were earlier.

18
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,290
Dammit! You're a criminal!

19
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,910
Don't talk saucy!

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,230
My noodle fists are gone!

21
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,400
Am I...

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,830
an onion or something?!

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,990
It's pointless to keep fighting.

24
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,480
Accept your loss and let me pass.

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,010
Accept my loss? Why would I?!

26
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,760
I'm not losing!

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,850
I'm Wanze, the ace of CP7!

28
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,260
Sorry, but I understand the
importance of this mission.

29
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,430
Nico Robin, one of your crewmates,

30
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,980
is a woman who the Government
has been pursuing for many years.

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,190
How could I hand her over
so easily, you fool?!

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,230
Ramen Kenpo!

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,150
Noodle Stake Knocker!

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,090
First, cut off the stem and the root
without hurting the flesh.

35
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,050
If you cut the fiber in one shot,

36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,640
the cut surface looks nice
and it retains its gloss.

37
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,140
Stop it! Stay back!

38
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,300
Ramen Beam!

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,480
Epluchage!

40
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,710
Although he's just a third-class cook
who plays with his food...

41
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,960
...I'll at least give him credit for taking
good care of his kitchen knives.

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,280
It's all right! Now let's move forward

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,610
with the sun always in our hearts

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,070
As power passes through our clasped hands

45
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,090
let's grab hold of our wishes

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Working together,

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,700
let's ride the giant waves

48
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,190
Let's hurry toward the excitement--

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,490
there's the starting signal

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,560
Now's the time to set sail--

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,430
let's raise anchor

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,300
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,800
and head for a sea of adventure

54
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,490
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

55
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,360
but what you cherish most will be right there

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,360
And if you get into a jam

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,820
I'll always be there to protect you

58
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,620
It's all right! Now let's move forward

59
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,120
with the sun always in our hearts

60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,250
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,250
and gaze at the light beyond

62
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,110
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

63
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,640
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,060
So let's grab hold of our wishes

65
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,340
under the same flag-- together, we're one

66
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,630
One Piece

67
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,870
"Rooftop Duel! Franky vs. Nero"

68
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,090
It's a star shield.

69
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,250
What's up with his body?

70
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,650
He's no longer human.

71
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,560
More flame?!

72
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,220
Master Nails!

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,310
Moon Walk!

74
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,550
He jumped again!

75
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,980
This is getting nowhere!

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,530
I guess it can't be helped
if my Four Powers don't work.

77
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,910
Sorry, I'll use some props,

78
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,870
since I haven't mastered
Finger Pistol yet!

79
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,890
All right!

80
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm going to the next car while I can!

81
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,580
Hey, hold it, you bastard!

82
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,380
You can't be too careful with this guy!

83
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,920
He fell for it.

84
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,590
Beans Left!

85
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,260
Sorry...

86
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,930
I knew...

87
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,100
...you'd do something like that!

88
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,400
Owww!

89
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,860
It worked!

90
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,640
You son of a bitch...

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,740
Ouch Finger!

92
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,620
Shave!

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
Dammit...

94
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,170
He noticed it...

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,580
Tempest Kick!

96
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,030
It grazed me!

97
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,130
He sure moves around a lot!

98
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,120
So your weak point...

99
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,930
...is your back, huh?

100
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,010
I've already figured out
your petty nature, too.

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,500
Now it's just a matter of time
before I win, isn't it?

102
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,730
Don't get so carried away!

103
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,870
I have no weak point if I do this.

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
Franky...

105
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,310
...Invincible! Tada!

106
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,160
"Invincible"

107
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,030
Now, do you give up, you weasel jerk?!

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,990
I don't know what to say to him...

109
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,510
What's going on?

110
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,810
Why are you here?!

111
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,430
How'd you get on board?!

112
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,420
I can't answer if you bombard me
with questions like that.

113
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,990
Well, calm down a little.

114
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,980
Ah, shall I pour you
some coffee or something?

115
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,280
Stop fooling around!

116
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,750
What on earth...?

117
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,840
How do you do?

118
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm Sogeking,
the king of snipers.

119
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,290
To make a long story short,
I've come to rescue you.

120
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,940
Long-nose...

121
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,810
It's not just me.

122
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,170
Sanji-kun and a thug named Franky

123
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,600
are currently engaged
in battle on this train.

124
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,630
During their fights, I found
a chance to come here.

125
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,050
Furthermore, Luffy-kun and the others

126
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,720
are also on this railway following
this train using the other sea train...

127
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,870
He's bringing a big group.

128
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,530
On my way here earlier,

129
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
I peeked inside
of the train through the windows.

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,700
Frankly, those four people in the
car behind this one are dangerous.

131
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,810
It'd be best if I could rescue you

132
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,850
before Sanji-kun confronts them.

133
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,820
Now, let's run...

134
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,280
together!

135
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,860
What's the matter?

136
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,820
There's no need to worry.

137
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,480
I'm all prepared.

138
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,940
These Octopu-shoes are for you.

139
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,190
If you put them on your hands and feet,

140
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,490
you can get out through the window and
stick to the outer panels of the sea train.

141
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,640
Now, put them on before they notice.

142
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,610
Wait.

143
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,030
"Wait"?

144
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,960
How could this be happening?

145
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,430
I thought I clearly
told you all goodbye.

146
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,620
I'll never return to the Straw Hats!

147
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,650
They know why you are
so insistent about that.

148
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,020
I heard that Ice pops at the
shipbuilding yard clarified everything.

149
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,300
So he survived?

150
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,180
No... Even so, I won't return...

151
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,650
to you guys...

152
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,230
Enough with that!

153
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,140
You still don't get it?!

154
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,910
They're not so weak that
you need to worry about them!

155
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,950
Before you took such a stupid deal,

156
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,510
they really wanted you
to talk to them first!

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,250
You really think
they'd be happy to be alive

158
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,630
knowing that it was because
their friend had to sacrifice herself?!

159
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,590
Now that they know why you left them,

160
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,720
they'll follow you
to the depths of hell

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,550
and take out your enemies!

162
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,290
You

163
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,080
still don't get what
kind of man Luffy is!

164
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,770
It's you guys who don't get it!

165
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,830
I don't have the slightest
desire to be rescued!

166
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,360
Don't just do as you please!

167
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,940
What'd you say, you...

168
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,160
What are you making a
racket for, Nico Robin?

169
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,990
What's the matter?

170
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,000
Now that Enies Lobby
is getting closer,

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,590
is it hard for even you to remain calm?

172
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,170
Even if you cry about your destiny now,

173
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,340
it's not like your life
will be saved or anything.

174
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,910
It's nothing.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,550
What was that?

176
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,060
It looks suspicious!

177
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,820
In addition, she seems
different than before.

178
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,410
Is it just my imagination?

179
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,570
It's nothing...

180
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,390
so leave me alone.

181
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,850
What the hell?

182
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,760
Why is this
woman goofing around?

183
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,310
A rabbit?

184
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,250
Hey! Cut it out!

185
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,250
Enough with the jokes!

186
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,760
Be serious!

187
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,370
Get up!

188
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,580
Watch your mouth, you weasel jerk.

189
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,680
I'm not joking.

190
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,730
In any case, how unlucky...

191
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,940
Really, how unlucky... you are.

192
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,710
You made me angry...

193
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,780
and I happen to be super this week.

194
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,120
Say, buddy...

195
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,630
Do you know a monster
called the centaur?

196
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,830
The one that's human from the
waist up and horse below, right?

197
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,300
What about it?

198
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,450
Con...vert!

199
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,100
"Convert"

200
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,850
"Pervert"

201
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,780
Don't tell me he's gonna...

202
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,530
Franky...

203
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,540
...Centaur!

204
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,810
Wrong way!

205
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,960
Your body should be in front!

206
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,780
Wait to complain

207
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,030
until you see its attacking power.

208
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,990
Aren't we catching up
with Bashing Tom yet?!

209
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,830
That's "Puffing"!

210
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,320
Hey, Luffy! Stay inside!

211
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,170
You just changed,
but you're soaking wet again!

212
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,260
That's okay!

213
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,460
I like this place!

214
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,450
Geez...

215
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,380
Gum-Gum...

216
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,550
Three-Hundred Pound...

217
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,850
...Cannon! Boom!

218
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,060
Splash!

219
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,520
Ahh! This is it! Laguna!

220
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
This is no time for playing!

221
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,480
We're bored.

222
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,860
Polish your weapons or
something, you idiots!

223
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,790
Well, um...

224
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,370
I'll talk to those guys later, so...

225
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,160
Hm?

226
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,290
Hey, guys!

227
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,750
I see a train ahead of us!

228
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
It's gotta be Puffing Tom, right?!

229
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,630
Isn't it too early?

230
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,170
Dammit!

231
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,650
What's gonna happen to us?

232
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,070
There's no engine on this car.

233
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,860
We have no choice
but to wait to be rescued.

234
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,490
Whoa! We're rocking!

235
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,950
But will someone really come
to rescue us in this storm?

236
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,160
They have to. Or we're screwed.

237
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,630
Hey, guys.

238
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,080
There's something
coming from behind!

239
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,850
Really?!

240
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,870
It must be a rescue ship!

241
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,370
Well... it looks like...

242
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,750
it's coming on the railway.

243
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,340
Can't be...

244
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,760
There's only
one sea train in the world.

245
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,470
Besides, it was impossible to leave
Water Seven after the last departure.

246
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,930
Then...

247
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,120
...what's coming?

248
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,710
Hey, that's a sea train,

249
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,360
but it's just cars
without the engine room!

250
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,110
It's sitting motionless on the railway!

251
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,240
What?!

252
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,820
What's going on?!

253
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,320
Does this mean that they got detached?

254
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,060
Ah! Sanji and Usopp may be on them!

255
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,210
Big Bro Franky, too!

256
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,840
This isn't good!

257
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,920
If we keep going like this,
we'll collide with them!

258
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,210
Granny! Where's the brake?!

259
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,830
I said it doesn't work, didn't I?

260
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,440
Do something.

261
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,680
We're gonna crash!

262
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,550
Luffy! What're you gonna do?

263
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,570
I'll go check inside!

264
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,390
Gum-Gum... Rocket!

265
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,690
Something is flying towards...

266
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,530
What happened?!

267
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,240
Ow, ow, ow...

268
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,960
All right! I got in!

269
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,200
Wh-Who are you?!

270
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,220
Hello! Sanji!

271
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,940
Are you in here?!

272
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,450
Usopp...

273
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,870
Hello! Sanji!

274
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,930
Hello!

275
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,640
I wonder if they're over there.

276
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,420
This guy... Could it be...!

277
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,530
It's Straw Hat Luffy!

278
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,450
Hello!

279
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,670
Are you here, Sanji?!

280
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,080
Sanji!

281
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,960
Hey, shut up!

282
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,690
Straw Hat!

283
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,380
There's no escape for you!

284
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,430
Where's Sanji?

285
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,100
Wh-Who's that?

286
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,780
Sanji! He's my friend!

287
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,520
We don't know a guy like that!

288
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,340
I see...

289
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,480
Then, see ya.

290
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,440
Shoot him!

291
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,820
Straw Hat is coming out!

292
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,990
He's saying that they're not
in there... while being shot!

293
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,950
Then, everyone in there is
Government personnel, huh?

294
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,330
So what're you gonna do if so?

295
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,650
Unless we move those
cars out of our way,

296
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,170
we'll take a lot of damage, too!

297
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,970
That's a sea train, after all!

298
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,760
We're gonna be knocked off!

299
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,100
Well, if things go wrong, it could
possibly cause a huge explosion!

300
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,650
Stop!

301
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,270
It's the Franky Family's
turn to work now.

302
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,230
We'll demolish them
right before we collide!

303
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,980
All right! We'll give
you guys a hand, too!

304
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,400
Guys! It's time to work!

305
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,030
Yeah!

306
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,080
Hey! Zoro!

307
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,120
Hey, Roronoa.
He's calling your name.

308
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,740
Cut them.

309
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,080
They're in our way.

310
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,790
Sure.

311
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,650
"Sure"?!

312
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,100
We're gonna collide!

313
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,010
Stop!

314
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,300
The ego of the entropic world...

315
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,780
...can be slashed into pieces.

316
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,220
Two-Sword Style Sword Draw...

317
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,390
...Rashomon!

318
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,810
What?!

319
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,560
Whaaat?!

320
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,020
--Whaaat?!
--Whaaat?!

321
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,850
Hey, you guys!

322
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,110
If you were going to
do something like that,

323
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,500
you could've at least told us.

324
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,300
You heard me saying,
"Cut them," right?!

325
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,130
Who would think he could?!

326
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,630
We would've collided
if we didn't cut them, right?!

327
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,590
Well, that's true,

328
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,710
but we needed
to be prepared, you know!

329
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,120
Even a monster like him
isn't the leader of the group?

330
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,190
He's something else.

331
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,060
Anyway, you're amazing!

332
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,750
In any case, to think that
there was another sea train...

333
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,730
With that speed, they might catch up.

334
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,140
If, by any chance,

335
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,190
the criminals
under escort are taken away...

336
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,380
That's not going to happen!

337
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,760
He is between them and
the preceding sea train!

338
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,210
That's right!

339
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,220
As long as
we have him in the Navy,

340
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,350
our justice will never sway!

341
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,560
All right! Here goes!

342
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,320
Two-Sword Style Sword Draw...

343
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,780
...Rashomon!

344
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,200
Hey! You're supposed to be the train!

345
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,240
Why me?! You do it!

346
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,700
No, you do it!

347
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,330
No! I don't wanna be cut in half!

348
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,180
Get cut in half!

349
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,660
No!

350
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,250
Hey, guys!

351
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,830
Huh?!

352
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,510
We're not done yet.

353
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,130
What the hell is that?!

354
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,720
It's a Sea King!

355
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,600
A huge monster like this was...

356
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,810
Sashimi!

357
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,310
It's been split in half!

358
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,270
Grilled fish!

359
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,400
Something that huge was...

360
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,740
It was so huge that it could've
swallowed Rocketman in one gulp!

361
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,670
Further ahead on this railway...

362
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,790
...lies the one who
cut that thing up...!

363
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,300
We had a dream that day

364
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,120
Our belief in ourselves

365
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,170
makes us able to cross

366
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,130
the wildly surging ocean

367
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,630
You're braver and more caring

368
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,310
than anyone else

369
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,020
If you ever depart this ship

370
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,860
and live in a different world

371
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,650
In the end,

372
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,280
we can all surely smile

373
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,480
Who the hell is that?!

374
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,800
Ahh! That's the Ship-Slasher!

375
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,860
Ship-Slasher?

376
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,640
Ship-Slasher T-Bone,
a Captain at Navy Headquarters!

377
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,590
He's a crazy guy
who cuts ships like steaks!

378
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,010
Interesting.

379
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,050
Hey! I'll tell you only once!

380
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,700
Get out of our way!

381
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

382
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,980
"Clash! Demon-Slasher Zoro
vs. Ship-Slasher T-Bone"

383
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
