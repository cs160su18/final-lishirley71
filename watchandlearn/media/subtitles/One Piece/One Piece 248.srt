2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,990
Mozu!

3
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,290
Kiwi!

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,130
Pardon me... for interrupting.

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,340
It's just, these two ladies didn't let us in, so...

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,180
What the hell are you bastards doing here?!

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,890
--Iron Body!
--Hm? You son of a bitch!

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,110
Blueno! What's the meaning of...

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,660
Huh? What's this? How cocky...!

10
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,160
Who do you think I am?!

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,660
Who are you trying to pick a fight with?!

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,710
You're only a dull bar owner!

13
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,960
What's up with that getup?!

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,180
You seem different from your usual self!

15
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,010
Tsk.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,060
Don't, Blueno.

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,900
H-Hey! A-Are you okay?!

18
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,610
--Hang in there!
--We can't kill him yet. Don't forget our mission.

19
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,530
--Sorry.
--Wh-Wh-What's going on?! Hey!

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,200
I thought I saw them working at the shipyard!

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,620
What the hell? Why was he able to...

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,960
You bastards! What are you people?!

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,580
You sure are acting pretty super, aren't you?!

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,050
How dare you hurt innocent girls?!
They're like my little sisters, you jerks!

25
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,380
To start with, how the hell
do you know about this place?

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,510
This is my secret base!

27
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,520
We don't care about that. I'll keep
this simple. Listen carefully.

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,140
Our lives in this town were a cover.

29
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,770
In reality, we are World
Government intelligence agents.

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,650
You must know what that means...

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,990
...as well as the reason we came here.

32
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,030
Franky... we already know everything.

33
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,120
Cutty Flam...

34
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,370
Tom's other disciple, who was said
to have died eight years ago...

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,790
That's you.

36
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,670
I don't know how you found
that out... but that's splendid.

37
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,550
At the same time, I'm starting to feel uneasy.

38
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,680
Is that idiot Iceberg doing okay?

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,640
We killed him.

40
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,690
It's all right! Now let's move forward

41
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,650
with the sun always in our hearts

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,990
As power passes through our clasped hands

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,660
let's grab hold of our wishes

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:20,670
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

45
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:28,020
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

46
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,940
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

47
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:42,070
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

48
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,450
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

49
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,410
but what you cherish most will be right there

50
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,420
And if you get into a jam

51
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,460
I'll always be there to protect you

52
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,630
It's all right! Now let's move forward

53
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,180
with the sun always in our hearts

54
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,180
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

55
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,480
and gaze at the light beyond

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,400
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,690
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

58
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,650
So let's grab hold of our wishes

59
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:27,450
under the same flag-- together, we're one

60
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,080
One Piece

61
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:46,340
"Franky's Past! The Day
the Sea Train First Ran"

62
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,310
Don't try to play innocent now...

63
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,180
...as we already know everything.

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,150
It's only a matter of time before I get targeted.

65
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,610
Leave the island with them... Franky.

66
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,320
Tom handed them down to Iceberg...
and Iceberg to you.

67
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,530
Both of you, come over here.

68
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,990
I wanna entrust something
important to you two.

69
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,120
Our mission took quite a while,
but it's finally checkmate.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,250
Now, hand over the blueprints for the
ancient weapon Pluton, Cutty Flam.

71
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,510
Flam...? That's a strange name.

72
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,840
"Franky" would do, right? "Franky" would.

73
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,010
Anything is fine.

74
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,060
Can you hear me?

75
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,230
I'm saying hand them over to us, Cutty Flam.

76
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,110
I've got nothing I could give you jerks!

77
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,900
Wha...!

78
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,410
Wh-What just happened?! It was so
fast that I couldn't see anything.

79
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,670
Hey! Are you okay?!

80
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,880
This is...

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,130
What's the matter, Lucci?

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,350
What is this filthy room?

83
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,310
A drafting room?

84
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,020
Oh?

85
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,600
It's a good place to hide blueprints. Find them!

86
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,280
These are... nameplates?

87
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,830
Cutty Flam.

88
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,450
Iceberg.

89
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,660
Tom.

90
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,370
This name is...

91
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,870
Hm?

92
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,380
This is...

93
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,260
Don't you dare touch it!

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,510
Don't intrude upon someone's memories!

95
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,220
This is where we grew up.

96
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,560
The shipbuilding company, Tom's Workers!

97
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,310
It's where the world's best shipwright lived!

98
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,240
"Water Seven, 22 years ago"

99
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,960
He's gonna eat me!

100
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,210
Take these!

101
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,440
Move! Move aside, Iceberg!

102
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,110
Well...! What the hell are you doing, Franky?!

103
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,910
Well...! What the hell are you doing
instead of helping me with work?!

104
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,040
To think that you keep
making unstable stuff like this!

105
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,380
Shut up! It's none of
your business, Stupid-berg!

106
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,470
This is my precious battleship,
the Battle Franky!

107
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,300
I don't know what that is, but ditch the
whole thing before someone gets hurt!

108
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,310
This is the scrap heap island! It's my
own business to keep whatever I want!

109
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,140
Just wait and see!

110
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,180
Next time for sure, I'll build a
battleship that will beat Sea Kings!

111
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,940
Well...! There's no way you can
beat them! I hope you get eaten!

112
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,690
--I can beat them!
--Well...! You can't!

113
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,110
--I can!
--Well...! You can't!

114
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,990
If you're a man... do it resolutely!

115
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,220
That concludes the launch ceremony!

116
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,680
We were resolutely able
to make a solid, good ship!

117
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,770
Right, Yokozuna?

118
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,890
Ribbit! Ribbit!

119
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,600
Let's finish it up tomorrow, shall we?
Now, let's go home.

120
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,440
Ribbit, ribbit!

121
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,650
Boy, I'm hungry.

122
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,900
--Ribbit, ribbit!
--I wonder what we're having for dinner.

123
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,530
Ribbit, ribbit!

124
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,740
Hey, wait up, Tom-san!

125
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,080
So which Battle Franky did
you build this time, Franky?

126
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,630
The eighth one! It was close!

127
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,710
Don't lie!

128
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,630
Geez... Since you let him do this stuff,
Tom-san, he gets full of himself!

129
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,430
All he makes are weapons!

130
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,220
Shut up, Stupid-berg!

131
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,520
What'd you say, Moron-ky?!

132
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,690
--Now, now, stop fighting, both of you.
--He said "Moron-ky"!

133
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,030
But Kokoro-san! This idiot was...!

134
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,110
Geez...

135
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,110
You too, Tom-san. You're laughing
too hard. What was so funny?

136
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,950
Oh... yeah... I just remembered...

137
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,830
I heard that another trading ship with
lumber on it was attacked by pirates.

138
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,410
After the King of the Pirates was executed,

139
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,750
the number of pirates grew considerably.

140
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,300
It's all over for this town. It's being
overtaken by the pirate era.

141
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,210
People are in low spirits.

142
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:26,850
"Merchant"

143
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,930
We can now get lumber and iron

144
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,060
only from other islands due to
the floods caused by Aqua Laguna,

145
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,850
and yet, violent seas and pirates hinder trading.

146
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,400
Shipyards scramble for customers
due to the shortage of work.

147
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,020
They start fighting. They lose their jobs.

148
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,320
If nothing is done, Water Seven,

149
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,450
an island that once left its mark
with its shipbuilding business,

150
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:46,330
will become weak-minded,
just waiting for floods to happen.

151
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,540
That's right! Tom-san built
an incredible pirate ship, too!

152
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,880
Say, teach me how to draw
blueprints for a pirate ship!

153
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,510
What's so funny?

154
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,970
Franky, there's no such thing
as blueprints for a pirate ship.

155
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,350
If the sailors who board a ship put up
a skull flag, then it's a pirate ship.

156
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,730
If they put up a seagull flag,
then it's a Navy ship.

157
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,230
I don't care what you wanna build,

158
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,030
but a man should be resolutely
proud of the ship he built!

159
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,780
Aren't you going to bed yet, Tom-san?

160
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,870
What're you drawing?

161
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,210
Mm... It's this island's hope.

162
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,080
Hope?

163
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,630
Hopefully, it can revive Water Seven.

164
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,880
Now, go to bed.

165
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,920
Yeah.

166
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,880
Hm?

167
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,310
Ahh!

168
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,240
The Government's Judicial Ship is here!

169
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,120
What's a Judicial Ship?

170
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,410
It's a mobile court.
Who did they come to judge?

171
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,790
Wait a sec! What did
Tom-san do to deserve this?!

172
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,460
Hey! Outta my way, you jerks!
Give us Tom-san back!

173
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,260
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

174
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,060
Tom-san! Tom-san!

175
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,360
The King of Pirates, Gold Roger,
was executed the other day.

176
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,400
We consider shipbuilding engineer Tom's
act of building Gold Roger's pirate ship,

177
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,820
the Oro Jackson, to be aiding and
abetting this vicious world-class criminal.

178
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,500
Hence, Tom will be taken to
Enies Lobby to be executed!

179
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
What?!

180
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,480
This is terrible! Tom will...
Tom will be executed!

181
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,100
They say it's on the charge of
building the King of the Pirates' ship.

182
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,150
So it's finally time, huh?

183
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,480
It caused problems for the
entire world. They had no choice.

184
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,610
Normally, no matter whom a shipwright
sells a ship to, it's not a crime.

185
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,870
However, the King of
the Pirates is an exception.

186
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,450
We consider all those who have
assisted in his pirating activities

187
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,120
to be dangerous individuals!
Hence, he's sentenced to the death penalty!

188
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,630
Take the offender away.

189
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,290
Yes, sir!

190
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,000
--Now, let's go.
--Hurry up and walk!

191
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,170
--What's the matter?
--Go already!

192
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,510
Hey, what're you doing?!

193
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,260
I'm currently designing...

194
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:55,140
...a paddle steamer that resolutely runs
on a railway set on the ocean's surface.

195
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,060
--Hey! What're you saying?!
--Why, you...!

196
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:05,240
Suppose this island's decline is due
to trade not happening as we wish it...

197
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,990
Suppose the hopelessness that people feel

198
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,950
is coming from the worries
about this sinking island...

199
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,040
Putting a sea train into operation...

200
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,500
...will definitely save Water Seven someday!

201
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,340
I-I'm sorry! We'll take him out right away!

202
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,840
No... wait a moment.

203
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,420
Huh?

204
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,430
Sea train, you said?

205
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,510
It's a ship that puffs smoke

206
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,430
and runs from one island
to another on a sea railway.

207
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,560
It'll carry people and goods as well as ships.

208
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,020
Without having to worry about the weather,

209
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,730
everyone will be able to freely cross the ocean.

210
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,150
Stop kidding yourself!

211
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,320
A railway? It'd be destroyed
once Aqua Laguna comes!

212
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,990
That's right! Besides, there are
also Sea Kings in the sea!

213
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,830
The sea railway doesn't have to be fixed.

214
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,580
It'll sway a little below the surface of
the water, never resisting the waves.

215
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,050
As if pulling in a rope, the sea train
will just use the railway as a guide.

216
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,090
Furthermore, I'm thinking of adding
a mechanism that generates

217
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,470
a discordant sound that fish hate
between the paddles and the railway.

218
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,770
Then Sea Kings won't come close to the railway.

219
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,390
Is something like that possible?

220
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,360
If we connect St. Poplar, Pucci,
San Faldo, and this island,

221
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,280
industries can grow through trading.

222
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,200
How wonderful...!

223
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,450
The blueprints will be completed soon,

224
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,120
but it's not so simple that
ordinary shipwrights can build it.

225
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,660
Is it possible to connect Enies Lobby as well?

226
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,580
Of course it is!

227
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,710
Once this technology is completed
and eventually crosses the ocean,

228
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,550
the relationships among islands all
around the world will resolutely change!

229
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,340
The sea train is the hope of Water Seven!

230
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,300
How long will it take?

231
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,760
Ten years.

232
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,430
Then build it!

233
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,310
As the development period for the sea train,

234
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,940
I give ten years probation
to shipbuilding engineer Tom!

235
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,990
This is incredible!

236
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,950
Good luck, Tom!

237
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,610
Please save Water Seven!

238
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,250
I'm resolutely still alive!

239
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,540
This is no laughing matter, Tom-san.

240
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,710
I thought that your time had come
and I got a chill down my spine.

241
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,340
But anyway, if things go well, they may
let the matter with Roger go, huh?

242
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,670
Well...! At any rate, you're great, Tom-san!

243
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,930
To think that you've been
thinking about something like that!

244
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,930
Everyone was overwhelmed!
The sea train really is...

245
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,850
Thanks for the dinner! Come, Yokozuna!
I'll teach you how to do the front crawl!

246
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,940
Ribbit!

247
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,810
Hey, Franky! What's with you?!
You've been sulking for a while now!

248
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,730
Shut up! I'm angry at everything!

249
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,990
Gold Roger's ship is the only ship in the
world that went around the Grand Line!

250
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,410
Why does Tom-san, who built such
a great ship, have to get executed?!

251
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,370
The people there were also
saying that it was just natural,

252
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,410
even though those idiots can't even build a raft!

253
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,790
I also know that the reason
our company is under a bridge

254
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,750
is because you were kicked out by the
townspeople over Roger's ship, right?!

255
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,720
Why the hell does the world's best
shipwright have to be treated like this?!

256
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,840
What's funny, you horned raccoon dog?!

257
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,470
Who're you taking it out on, Moron-ky?!
You are not gonna get away with it!

258
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,430
I can't stand that the person
himself is like that, either!

259
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,310
No, no! That's not it!

260
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,280
Stroke with all your might
to push the water backwards!

261
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,740
Ribbit! Ribbit!

262
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,200
No! No! Stroke more vigorously like this!

263
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,330
--Ribbit!
--No! Like this!
--Seriously, what's with him?!

264
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,290
You should just kick out an idiot like him!

265
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,410
Well, don't say that. He's a fellow shipbuilder.

266
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,960
In terms of shipbuilding skills,

267
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,840
there's already no big difference between
him and the craftsmen on the island....

268
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,000
...though what he makes is shaky.

269
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,970
He's just always honest, that's all.

270
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,730
Two years ago, when I saw a kid who had
resolutely appeared on the scrap heap island

271
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,020
make a cannon using junk,
I was really surprised.

272
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,490
Old man, take me in!
I was abandoned by my parents!

273
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,030
He told me that his parents said,
"What an uncontrollable brat,"

274
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,160
and threw him off the ship.

275
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,500
It seems that they were worthless
pirates from some place, though.

276
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,210
--That was so funny!
--Tom-san...

277
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,210
He's tough, isn't he?

278
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,670
Despite his circumstances, he isn't crooked.

279
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,420
You two will definitely become world-class
shipbuilding engineers someday.

280
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,300
You should be nice to each other.

281
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,890
Franky can't do it. He's crazy
even at the cellular level!

282
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,230
Well, as soon as I finish the blueprints,
we'll start building the sea train!

283
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,810
Yeah... but I bet he won't help us.

284
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,610
He can do as he pleases!

285
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,000
Suicide?

286
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,670
I heard that it was the president
of the No. 4 shipbuilding company.

287
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,750
It must be because of that accident.

288
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,630
Since they didn't have materials, he went
to purchase lumber on his own ship

289
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,800
and got fifty people killed on the sea.

290
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,640
His shipyard is closed, too.

291
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,980
How weak humans are, huh?

292
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,480
Is this really it for this island?

293
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,280
Hey! Did you guys hear
about the scrap heap island?!

294
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,570
H-Hey, is that true?!

295
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,530
Tom's Workers has finished
building the sea train, you say?!

296
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,080
Whoa! Does a ship like this really run?

297
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,960
It's a ship built by a criminal. It's dangerous!

298
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,420
I'll get on board!

299
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,500
Me too, then.

300
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,080
Tom! You are not gonna explain?!

301
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,380
We're leaving! Get on board!

302
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,760
It's moving!

303
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,220
The paddles are grabbing the railway!

304
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,850
--It's moving!
--Whoa, amazing! It's running!

305
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,820
Twelve years ago...

306
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,580
...leaving a closed, declining town,

307
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,170
with worried people on board...

308
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:05,970
...the sea train Puffing Tom crossed
the sea for the first time.

309
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,240
We had a dream that day

310
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,080
Our belief in ourselves

311
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,170
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

312
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:56,770
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

313
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:06,940
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

314
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:15,660
In the end, we can all surely smile

315
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,840
I see. So this is a place that holds
your memories with Tom, huh?

316
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,680
The blueprints aren't here!
Get out of here already!

317
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,350
Hmph! Well, fine.
You're a criminal, just like Tom was.

318
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,720
You should know what'll happen to you.

319
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,770
You don't know anything about Tom-san!
Don't talk like you know everything!

320
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

321
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,480
"Spandam's Scheme!
The Day the Sea Train Shook"

322
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
