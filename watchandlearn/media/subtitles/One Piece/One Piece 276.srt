00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,670
Hey, is it true that a Navy ship came?

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,460
What? A Navy ship did?

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,300
Yeah, I heard that it was
anchored here when day broke.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,140
Why would the Navy come...

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,800
...to such a remote island?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,720
But no one has seen any marines on it.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,760
What the heck?

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,440
Not even a single person can be found.
It's like a ghost ship.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,510
That's ridiculous.

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,900
--Professor!
--Professor Clover!

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,530
Did something happen?

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,790
I hope it's nothing to worry about,
but a Navy ship is anchored at the seashore!

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,000
They might be here for an investigation.
We should be cautious, just in case!

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,440
Let the scholars know.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,340
The raft is finished!

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,060
Then... you're leaving already?

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,100
What's wrong? You've got
"I'm lonely" written all over your face.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,150
Come to think of it, I was thinking
of attaching a flag or something.

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,720
So I'll stay here a little longer.

21
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,900
To sea? So you wanna set out to sea, too?

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,740
Yep.

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,710
My mom has been busy with her
archaeological research all this time.

24
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,050
But when she comes back
to this island next time,

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm going to ask her to take me with her to sea.

26
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,010
So I studied hard and I was finally
able to become an archaeologist.

27
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,850
An archaeologist? When you're still so small?

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,160
Yep.

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,650
But... you don't even remember
your mom's face, right?

30
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,100
Right... but she's still my mom.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,620
I wanna see her.

32
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,040
--Say, Saul...
--Hm?

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,020
Do you know that the world has a blank history
of 100 years that no one knows about?

34
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,420
Yeah. It's called the "Blank Century."

35
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm curious about it, but the Government
prohibits people from investigating, so...

36
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,430
Yeah. I heard that my mom is traveling
around the world investigating it.

37
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,250
But don't tell anyone about it,
since it's actually a crime.

38
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,140
What?!

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,030
C-Could it mean that she's traveling in
search of those stones called Poneglyphs?

40
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,640
So you know about Poneglyphs?

41
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,610
Of course I do! But don't talk
about it in front of people, okay?!

42
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,540
Not to mention, about your
mom traveling in search of... Ah!

43
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,460
What's wrong?

44
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,860
Robin... Do you know your mom's name?

45
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,370
Olvia.

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,470
It's Nico Olvia.

47
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,760
Saul?!

48
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,670
Robin is Olvia's daughter...!

49
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,400
Then... could this place be...
an island called Ohara?!

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,660
--Yeah.
--Ahh! This is terrible! Oh, no!

51
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,580
So I drifted to Ohara?!

52
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,450
This is no time to be sitting around talking!

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,230
--Robin!
--What is it?

54
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,380
This might shock you, but listen to me carefully!

55
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,620
Navy battleships should be
headed to Ohara right now.

56
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,050
Navy? Why?

57
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,960
In order to eliminate the scholars on this island!

58
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,270
Eliminate them?

59
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,460
Don't tell...

60
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,740
--That's a lie...
--Don't tell the Government you're a scholar!

61
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,810
--That's a lie...!
--Got that?!

62
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,510
That's a lie!

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,970
It's true! I'd never lie to you!

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,230
Go to town now and see if anything
strange has been happening!

65
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,460
It's possible your mom might be back, too!

66
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,680
What?!

67
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:26,410
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

68
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,790
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

69
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,800
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,680
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,560
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

72
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,360
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

73
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,610
we will be able to make it through

74
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,900
Always!

75
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,580
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

76
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,550
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

77
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,590
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

78
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,180
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

79
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,490
We can't stop here

80
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,510
Around the world

81
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,770
Start me up!

82
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,510
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

83
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:50,580
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

84
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,540
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

85
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,330
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

86
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,340
Brand New World

87
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,760
Start me up!

88
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,930
"Fated Mother and Daughter!
The Mother's Name Is Olvia!"

89
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,950
It's been a while, everyone.

90
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,110
--Olvia...
--Olvia-san...!

91
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,410
So it was you who came on that Navy ship!

92
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,920
We thought you had been caught by the Navy...

93
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,130
I'm sorry that I came back bearing bad news.

94
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,850
But what I just said is true.

95
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,010
So the government has finally
set its sights on Ohara?

96
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,550
Did you read the newspaper?

97
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,430
The Poneglyph search team that set off
from Ohara six years ago was annihilated.

98
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,270
All of them except for me...
A total of 33 members...

99
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,770
I was also temporarily captured.

100
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,400
The government evaluated
my fellow scholars' belongings

101
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,430
and figured out that we came from Ohara.

102
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,580
This is inexcusable! To think that this
island is now in danger because of us!

103
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,370
Stop it! It's no one's fault!

104
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,590
Those who set out to sea and those
who stayed here--we're all one team!

105
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,810
It was you guys who experienced a terrible time.

106
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,560
We put you through a terrible ordeal.

107
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,480
Professor...

108
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,810
Ohara is a place where talented
scholars from all around the world

109
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,780
gather and continue to study history.

110
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,650
The Government has been
considering us a threat.

111
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,530
They must be thinking that they
finally found something on us.

112
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,560
They're not gonna pass up this opportunity.

113
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,950
Yes, but we were able to get
that information without delay!

114
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,210
In the end, everyone in Ohara who
claims to be a scholar will be eliminated!

115
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,010
So, everyone, get out of Ohara immediately!

116
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,490
Yeah... This time, we probably won't
be able to slip past their investigation

117
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,950
like we usually do...

118
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,040
...if they are trying to kill us.

119
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,380
Then, hurry up and...

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,350
But you know, Olvia...

121
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,190
I can't run away leaving this
treasure of mankind behind.

122
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,650
You should know that.

123
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,540
We feel the same way, Olvia.

124
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,440
You guys...

125
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,190
We don't know what the Government is up to.

126
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,940
But if we run, the precious history
that exists here won't be protected.

127
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,870
We'll try whatever we can,
just like we always have.

128
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,760
More importantly...

129
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,660
...there must be something
weighing on your mind.

130
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,910
But I can't see her.

131
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,880
Make up your mind, Olvia! Are you
gonna come aboard the ship or not?

132
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,620
If you have a lingering attachment
to your child, don't come with us.

133
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,590
If this is about your husband's
unfinished business, we will...

134
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,050
No! I'll come with you!

135
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,730
I'm a scholar from Ohara. I can't
abandon our predecessors' will!

136
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm sorry, Robin.

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,190
I'll solve all the mysteries
and come back for sure!

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,540
Mommy... Where's Mommy?
Where did Mommy go?

139
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,750
Your mom set out to sea for work.
You'll stay here with us for a while.

140
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,710
You're noisy! Be quiet or I'll hit you!

141
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,750
Hey, stop it. She's only two.

142
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,710
Our daughter is two, too.

143
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,260
I don't care whether she's your
big sister's child or whatever--

144
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,300
how dare you take in such a burden?!

145
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,720
Wow...

146
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,480
Who's there?! Don't move!

147
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,190
U-Um... I... Um...

148
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,970
I'm sorry!

149
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,460
When you wanna read books, just let me know.

150
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,410
But I don't have money, so...

151
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,080
You don't have to pay.
You can read them all for free.

152
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,340
--Free?
--Yeah, since this is the best library in the world.

153
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,510
--The best one in the world?
--That's right.

154
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,410
By the way, you're Olvia's daughter, right?

155
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,830
Do you like books?

156
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,380
Yeah.

157
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,390
She looks just like you did
when you were a child.

158
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,770
And like you were at that age,
she's a rare genius, too.

159
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,180
So long as I know she's okay...

160
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,910
I've stepped into this line of work.
So I have to give up my attachment to her,

161
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,450
since I can't make her a "criminal's daughter."

162
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,590
Professor Clover! This time, a ship flying
the World Government's flag has come!

163
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,080
A Government ship has come
all the way to the West Blue...

164
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,500
It indeed seems quite serious.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,550
Everyone, listen.

166
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,430
You guys and I are neither fellow
scholars nor acquaintances.

167
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,130
Keep that in mind... no matter what happens!

168
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,060
Wait, Olvia! What're you going to do?!

169
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,570
Hey, let the headquarters know
that we arrived at our destination.

170
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,030
Now, go, go, go! Keep on moving!

171
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,990
Geez... What a pain.

172
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,490
In any case, this work'd
better get me a promotion.

173
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,270
Hey, go get all the scholars and restrain them.

174
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,970
Yes, sir!

175
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,000
--What's going on?!
--A woman with a gun is running around!

176
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,590
For Heaven's sake! I'm sorry, Robin!

177
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,860
Vice Admiral Kuzan!

178
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,980
Hm? What is it?

179
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,520
We've been notified that CP9's
Chief Spandine has arrived in Ohara.

180
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,490
What? Is that something so important
that you had to wake me up to tell me?!

181
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,960
I-I'm sorry!

182
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,100
What's the matter, Robin?

183
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,800
Did my mom come here?

184
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,990
What're you saying? There's no way
that your mother is in Ohara, right?

185
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,740
I have to give up my attachment to her,

186
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,990
since I can't make her a "criminal's daughter."

187
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,000
What's this about all of a sudden?

188
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,820
Y-Yeah...

189
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,470
Oh, that's right! There's trouble!

190
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,910
I heard that Navy battleships
are coming to this island

191
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,770
in order to capture all
the scholars on this island.

192
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,130
Is there a disturbance or
something happening in town?

193
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,590
What?

194
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,430
It's not a battleship.

195
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,560
We heard that a Government
ship just came to this island.

196
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,520
It'll probably be a more
rigorous investigation than ever.

197
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,100
Listen, Robin. Even if the
Government people come,

198
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,940
don't tell them you're an
archaeologist no matter what.

199
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,650
Since you're small, no one will think
that you're a scholar. Got that?

200
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,780
Out of our way!

201
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,720
Stop what you're doing!
Get outside with your hands in the air!

202
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,620
You're being quite violent!

203
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,080
This Ohara lab is suspected of a
serious crime--deciphering Poneglyphs!

204
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,060
It requires a thorough search,
so all of you, go outside immediately!

205
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,640
Treat this place with care.

206
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,970
The value of everything in here
is beyond your imagination.

207
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,100
We don't have to listen to what you say!

208
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,060
Take them outside!

209
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,020
Yes, sir!

210
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,190
To all the townspeople!

211
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:05,990
We now suspect that this island's scholars
are devils who wish to destroy the world!

212
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,400
What?! Why?!

213
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,160
They're world-class scholars
and the pride of this island!

214
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,210
Consequently, we'll conduct a
large-scale search of the entire island!

215
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,710
During that time, those who have
nothing to do with archaeology

216
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,880
are expected to take an ID with them

217
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,210
and temporarily take refuge on the
evacuation ship at the west seashore!

218
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,840
An evacuation ship?!
Why are you going that far?

219
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,090
If it's the scholars' problem,
we have nothing to do with it.

220
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,800
So there should be no need
for us to leave the island.

221
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,440
It's our duty to pass that message to you.

222
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,740
No matter what happens later
to those who ignore our advice,

223
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,230
it's none of our concern.

224
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,530
--Leave town!
--Evacuate to the west seashore!

225
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,610
The World Government is up to something!

226
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,540
Ahhh! I got shot!

227
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Th-This is it for me! I'm a goner, dammit!

228
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,050
Tell the top... that I want my son
to take over the position of chief!

229
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,300
Chief, please take a close look.

230
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,680
The bullet just went through
the sleeve of your jacket.

231
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,770
Oh, I see.

232
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,680
I won't miss next time.

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,230
Well, well... To think that a heinous
criminal who splendidly escaped

234
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,150
the Navy's prison is coincidentally
visiting this island... Nico Olvia.

235
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,530
You kept denying your connection to
the Ohara scholars, and yet, here you are.

236
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,940
It seems as if you're declaring
that this is your hometown...

237
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,160
That the scholars here are committing
the same crime that you guys were.

238
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,120
My being here alone isn't proof of those things.

239
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,930
I'm sure you have all sorts of
excuses ready. You're a smart woman.

240
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,880
But it doesn't matter anymore.

241
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,470
Your connection to Ohara
doesn't need to be proved.

242
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,100
If we dig through every nook and corner,

243
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,440
evidence of your research on
Poneglyphs will turn up in no time.

244
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,070
The Government thinks that
the probability of this is 100%.

245
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,270
Being able to capture you guys,
who were on the run for six long years,

246
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,410
just gave the Government a small push.

247
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,860
There are plenty of Poneglyph
researchers around the world.

248
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,050
Each time we captured one, we always
searched for their connection to Ohara.

249
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,040
Do you know why that is?

250
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,500
Don't tell me... In order to
use Ohara as a warning...?!

251
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,480
Exactly! If Ohara, the holy land
of archaeology, is crushed,

252
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,960
it'll send shockwaves throughout academia.

253
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,470
We can make the world realize

254
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,940
what happens to those who
research the "Blank Century."

255
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,360
Then the battleships from Headquarters
under standby order are...

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,530
Whoa... Just how much do you know?

257
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,940
That's right.

258
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,080
They're used to ensure that not
even a single criminal escapes.

259
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,360
But as a matter of form,
we need to verify the crime.

260
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,700
After all, we're not pirates.

261
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,040
So I came all the way here to conduct
a compulsory investigation on the island

262
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,290
and to send off those who have
nothing to do with the matter.

263
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,760
Yeah, I came all this way.

264
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,130
Take her down.

265
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,850
Hey, stop it! The books
here are a world treasure!

266
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,730
There's still someone here? Take him outside!

267
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,940
--Come!
--Dammit, you bastards!

268
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,910
There's gotta be a hidden room!
Make sure we find it!

269
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,540
This is terrible...

270
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,490
The battleships are already within sight!

271
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,710
Is this all of them?!

272
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,940
Now, gather all the scholars here!

273
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,590
Look. The scholars have been captured.

274
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,140
What on earth did they do?

275
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,850
They said that the goal of the scholars'
research is to destroy the world!

276
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,900
That can't be right.

277
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,020
Where's the evacuation ship?!

278
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,900
It's at the west seashore! Hurry!

279
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,730
Hurry up and go! Hurry to the west seashore!

280
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,400
Robin... It seems that
there's an evacuation ship.

281
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,220
We can no longer tell what
the Government will do.

282
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,610
You hurry up and go there, too.

283
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,590
No! Even if I get on that ship,
there won't be nice people!

284
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,370
I'll stay here with you guys!

285
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,700
--Robin...
--Just like you guys, I'm a--

286
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,320
Just go already!

287
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,790
Are you guys working hard?!

288
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,230
Thank you for taking the
trouble to come here, Chief!

289
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:40,540
Anyway, I didn't expect that a ferocious
animal would appear on this island.

290
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,100
I was nearly killed.

291
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,190
Olvia...!

292
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,940
Olvia-san...!

293
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,840
All right, listen carefully.
This woman is an escaped prisoner.

294
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,690
The group she belonged to

295
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,360
was recently eliminated for the crime
of deciphering the ancient texts.

296
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,750
However, we still don't know the ringleader.

297
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,890
Well, if you guys are connected to this woman,
it'll make matters quite simple.

298
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,210
How terrible of them to hurt a woman like that.

299
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,590
Robin, go to the evacuation ship. Hurry!

300
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,040
Robin...

301
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,890
Robin...!

302
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,520
You've...

303
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,700
...grown so much!

304
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,650
Olvia...

305
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,200
Wh-What have they done?!

306
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,370
Have they no respect for the library?!

307
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,950
To think that they'd take
such drastic measures...!

308
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,960
Whoa... They've made a big show.

309
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,420
--Click.
--Hello? Is this the Chief?!

310
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,620
Yeah, it's me.

311
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,550
We've found it!

312
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,140
There's a secret room in the basement,

313
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,590
and in there, we found a huge stone
that's probably a Poneglyph

314
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,950
and research documents clearly
discussing the ancient texts!

315
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,620
All right, well done!

316
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,990
Click.

317
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,810
Well, scholars of Ohara!

318
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,770
Your death sentence has now been decided!

319
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,920
It's indeed regrettable...

320
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,390
...that the world's best archaeologists
lose their lives together today.

321
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,510
See? What a letdown. That was all I had to do!

322
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,920
The only thing I have left to do is
report this to the Five Elder Stars.

323
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,070
Roger.

324
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,160
Professor! Are they really gonna
kill all of you?! That's a lie, right?

325
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,470
Why would they do that just because
you read the ancient texts...?!

326
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:53,260
Idiot! You brat! The purpose of their
research is to revive a powerful weapon

327
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,820
and commit mass murder!

328
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,000
That's not true! They aren't
thinking about anything like that!

329
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,270
Robin, stop it. It's pointless to discuss
the matter with an errand boy like him.

330
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,490
What'd you say?!

331
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,140
Is it really the weapon itself that
the Government is afraid of?

332
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,240
--Professor!
--Professor Clover!

333
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,010
It's connected, Chief.

334
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,290
Okay.

335
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,960
--This is good timing.
--Huh?!

336
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,110
Let me speak to the Five Elder Stars,
the world's leaders, before I die.

337
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,460
We, the scholars at Ohara, have continued
our research for a long time,

338
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,980
and although the research isn't completed yet,

339
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,720
we formed a hypothesis
about the "Blank Century."

340
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,940
So I'd like to report it to them.

341
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,300
What rubbish...

342
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,400
--Hey.
--Yes, sir.

343
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,850
Robin, get out of here immediately.

344
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,850
Listening to what I'm about to say is a crime.

345
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,520
Professor...

346
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,840
Hey, it seems like the scholars
have been found guilty.

347
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,950
Is that true?!

348
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,960
Hey! Navy battleships are moving
toward here from the eastern sea!

349
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,740
They're gonna do something!
Let's hurry to the evacuation ship!

350
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,580
Wh-What the...?!

351
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,200
It's a giant!

352
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,040
Where are you, Robin?!

353
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,010
Escape from this island right away!

354
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

355
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,060
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

356
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,190
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

357
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,190
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

358
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,450
We'll become No. 1

359
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,320
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

360
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,530
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

361
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,700
an era created by risking everything

362
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,830
We always try our best, let's go!

363
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,830
If we want to achieve glory,

364
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,210
now is the time--don't be afraid

365
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,130
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

366
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,090
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

367
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,090
We can take off with unknown powers

368
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,350
We don't fear, and we don't waver

369
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,060
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

370
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,100
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

371
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,070
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

372
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,320
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

373
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Charge ahead

374
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,200
Let's start running towards tomorrow

375
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

376
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,550
Saul, please take care of Robin!

377
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,960
Please let my daughter
escape from here at any cost!

378
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,050
What?! What about you, Mom?!
Aren't you gonna come with me?!

379
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,740
There's still something
that I have to do here, so...

380
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,270
No! I don't wanna be separated!
I was finally able to meet you!

381
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,360
Mom!

382
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

383
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,670
"The Tragedy of Ohara!
The Terror of Buster Call"

384
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
