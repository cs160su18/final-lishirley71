2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,710
It's okay... Robin.

3
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,790
You'll be fine.

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,550
You're still hiding something, aren't you?

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,800
That's okay.

6
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,770
But a pirate... cannot leave their group...

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,360
...without their captain's... permission.

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,360
So...

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,150
...believe...

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,990
...in Luffy.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,120
F... Frog!

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,580
Ribbit!

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,920
Since...

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,920
...that day eight years ago...

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,840
Since that incident where
Tom-san was taken away...

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,760
...you've been challenging
the sea train every single day.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,770
So that you won't lose those you love again...

18
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,730
So that you can protect those you love...

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,650
Ribbit...

20
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,490
Yokozuna... Then now's the time for
you to show the result of that training!

21
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,950
Ribbit?

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,570
At any rate,

23
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,700
the Government has now successfully
obtained the two keys...

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,670
Me, who owns the weapon's blueprints,

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,880
and you, who can revive the existing weapon.

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,470
So, even if I could escape,
it's pointless if it's just me alone.

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,100
You, too, somehow go back to Straw Hat!

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,850
That's not possible.

29
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,060
I hurt them just by being with them.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,020
The people from the Government
say your existence is a sin,

31
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,440
but no matter what weapons you're carrying,
your being there isn't a sin.

32
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,370
Your existence isn't a sin!

33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,750
Open the main gate!

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,510
Whoa...! What the hell is this place?!

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,060
Is this... a waterfall?!

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,450
I can't see the bottom!

37
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,740
How noisy.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,710
Looks like Lucci and the
others are headed this way...

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,130
...bringing the best possible gift to us.

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,430
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,740
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

42
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,830
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

43
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,750
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

44
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:00,460
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

45
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,390
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

46
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,680
we will be able to make it through

47
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,890
Always!

48
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:18,610
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

49
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:24,570
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

50
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,620
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

51
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,250
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

52
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,460
We can't stop here

53
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,500
Around the world

54
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,750
Start me up!

55
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,510
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

56
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,640
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

57
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,610
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

58
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,400
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

59
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,370
Brand New World

60
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,910
Start me up!

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:23,010
"Landing Operations Start!
Charge in, Straw Hats!"

62
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,510
Hurry!

63
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,730
Can't we go any faster?!

64
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,120
Hey... Hey, then, Big Bro Franky
sacrificed himself and...

65
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,080
Yeah, that's right.

66
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,910
He tried to save Robin-chan.

67
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,710
What an amazing guy Bro is!

68
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,640
We'd better hurry up or it'll be too late.

69
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,680
Hey, we can now see the lights of
the nightless island! It's Enies Lobby!

70
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,600
What?! Is that true? All right!

71
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,610
We can go rescue Bro!

72
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,110
Nightless island?

73
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,610
Yeah. They don't have nights on that island.
It's also called a day island.

74
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,990
That's the judicial island.

75
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,080
Day island?

76
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,120
We found them! Huge Yagaras!

77
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,460
--Ribbit!
--Ahoy!

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,260
Luffy!

79
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,550
--Ribbit! Ribbit!
--Ah! Sanji!

80
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,640
Huh? Who's that?

81
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,140
It's been a while...

82
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,980
It's Straw Hat!

83
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,190
It seems that we were able to
join up with them smoothly, huh?

84
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,440
Looks like they're ready and willing

85
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,110
to march into the entrance
to the World Government!

86
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,780
That sounds reassuring!

87
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,330
Okay! Enies Lobby has come into sight!

88
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,870
Everyone, get ready for the showdown!

89
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,220
Well...

90
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,190
Today is a joyous day when all
eight members of CP9, including me,

91
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,770
are to gather together in one place
for the first time in five years.

92
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,400
And yet, what's up with this article?!

93
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,650
The orders to assassinate
the heads of the local branches

94
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,070
of the revolutionary army only
required you to kill three of them,

95
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,540
but twenty-three of them are dead!

96
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,500
If you have an excuse, I'd really like to hear it!

97
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,710
Yoyoi!

98
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,590
I am very sorry, Chief!

99
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,010
It is all...

100
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,840
...my fault!

101
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,890
"CP9 [Six Powers Master]
Jabra"

102
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,590
Stop it, Kumadori!

103
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,890
A man shouldn't apologize so easily!

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,390
I'll explain what happened
to Chief, so just sit tight!

105
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,390
"CP9 [Six Powers Master]
Fukurou"

106
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,810
Yoyoi! I'm sorry, Chief!

107
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,860
"CP9 [Six Powers Master]
Kumadori"

108
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,820
Now that it's come to this, I'll take
responsibility by committing hara-kiri!

109
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,900
--Don't be ridiculous!
--Yoyoi!

110
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,990
You've got it wrong, Chief!

111
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,660
On the instructed day, we infiltrated
them to carry out the assassinations,

112
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,540
but somehow they managed
to find out about our plans.

113
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,040
I talked about the assassination
plan in town, chapapa!

114
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,460
What?! You again, Fukurou?!

115
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,760
What's the point of that zipper on your mouth?!

116
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,680
And when will your
"foot-in-mouth" problem go away?!

117
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,350
We're intelligence agents who
have to strictly keep top secrets!

118
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,640
I talked about it, chapapa!

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,230
--Don't "chapapa" us!
--Yoyoyoi!

120
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,690
Please don't blame Fukurou!

121
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,900
I'll take responsibility by committing hara-kiri...

122
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,530
Iron Body.

123
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,780
How regrettable...! I can't die.

124
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,240
Just die already, you jerk!

125
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,870
You guys, that's enough...

126
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,550
Ouch! I spilt my coffee! Dammit!

127
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,010
Also, they said that Nero was useless.

128
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,630
Oh, well...

129
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,480
"Sniping"

130
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,620
I was born on the island of snipers

131
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,620
"Sniper Warrior
Sogeking"

132
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,170
I never miss my mark

133
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,050
Lulu lala lu

134
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,760
Whether it's a mouse's eyeball, lock on!!

135
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,970
Or even your heart, lock on!!

136
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:30,770
The man who hails from the island of snipers

137
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,230
Lululu, lulu lala

138
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,200
Now... run away!

139
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,780
Sogege, soge, soge

140
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:52,750
"Sniping"

141
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:49,000
Sogeking!

142
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,180
Sogeking from the island of snipers?!

143
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,520
That's right. I'm Usopp-kun's best friend.

144
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm here because he requested that I assist you.

145
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,560
H-Hero!

146
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,360
Since you're wearing a cape,
I thought that might be the case...

147
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,820
Amazing! I've never seen a hero before!

148
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,030
I see... He's a hero because
he's wearing a cape?

149
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,870
That's right! Cape buffalos are heroes, too!

150
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,490
Really?!

151
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,540
--Yeah, if someone is wearing a cape,
--Hey, that's Usopp.

152
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,000
--they're usually a hero.
--Usopp... I'm glad he was okay.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,620
That's the long nose who
marched into the Franky House.

154
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,750
That's the long nose who got caught with Bro.

155
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,050
Yeah.

156
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,340
N-Nice to meet you.

157
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,760
Ah, yes.

158
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,340
That's one of the guys I met at Shift Station.

159
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,510
May I have your autograph?

160
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,140
Sure.

161
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,970
"To Chopper-kun"

162
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,440
But then, where did Usopp go?

163
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,650
He's fine. You don't have
to worry about him at all.

164
00:11:54,650 --> 00:12:00,280
Anyway, he told me to put all my
energy into rescuing Robin-kun and left.

165
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,030
Yep. He's right.

166
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,490
Wh... Where is this island of snipers?

167
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,950
Yeah...

168
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,410
It's...

169
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,910
♪ I was born on... ♪

170
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,130
...in your...

171
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,090
...hearts.

172
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,550
--♪ ...the island... ♪
--Our hearts...!

173
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,550
♪ ...of snipers... ♪

174
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,010
Where's that?!

175
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,650
♪ I was born on... ♪

176
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,030
♪ "...the island of snipers..." Go! ♪

177
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,740
♪ ...the island of snipers... ♪

178
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,500
--Nami-san...
--Hm?

179
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,620
What is it, Sanji-kun?

180
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,170
And all you idiots here with Nami-san...

181
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,510
Before we go rescue Robin-chan,
let me tell you one thing.

182
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,390
That Buster Call is indeed the problem.

183
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,620
Many years ago, an island ceased to exist.

184
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,740
Five vice admirals and ten battleships...

185
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,620
To that woman who witnessed their
overwhelming military power,

186
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,420
Buster Call is an inexpungible nightmare.

187
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,260
If the terror planted in
her heart during her childhood

188
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,010
is directed towards her friends, she can
no longer have the spirit to resist us.

189
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,720
Don't tell me...

190
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,430
...you're doing this knowing all that...

191
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,850
Of course.

192
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,630
So, CP9 is taking advantage of the root
cause of Robin-chan's vulnerability.

193
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,590
It's not that I'm trying to make excuses
for not being able to get her back.

194
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,100
But even if we march into our enemy's territory,

195
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,720
it doesn't necessarily mean
that she'll let us help her.

196
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,400
Yes, we are. I'll never see you guys again.

197
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,410
That doesn't matter!

198
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,070
I'm not gonna stand for this!

199
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,620
That darn Robin!

200
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,250
Why Robin?!

201
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,630
Why not?! Why the heck doesn't
she want us to come rescue her?!

202
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,300
She's suffering thinking about what
might happen to us after she's rescued!

203
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,550
Who cares about that?!

204
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,760
If we don't do anything, she'll be killed, right?!

205
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,800
There's no way she wants to die,
so we'll rescue her!

206
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,720
Of course that's true, but...

207
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,440
Don't bother. Either way,
what we have to do is the same.

208
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,600
We'll just rescue her.

209
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,150
We'll bring down the whole place!

210
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,650
There's a technique that I wanna try, too!

211
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,570
Guys, take a look at this.

212
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,750
I've been to that island once
for railway maintenance.

213
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,580
I drew this based on my vague recollection of it.

214
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,460
This is a rough sketch of what the
geography of Enies Lobby looks like.

215
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,640
The Gates of Justice are
in the back of the island,

216
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,100
and they seem to be accessible
only via the Tower of Law.

217
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,260
What the hell is this? What's this dark area?

218
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,270
It indicates a waterfall.

219
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,690
A waterfall?

220
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,520
Well, you'll know what I
mean once you go in there.

221
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,520
If we can't recover Nico Robin
and Franky on this straight path

222
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,770
"Iron Fence" "Main Gate"

223
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,240
from the main gate to the Gates of Justice,

224
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,280
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

225
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,240
"Gates of Justice" "Tower of Law"

226
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
we will have lost.

227
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,860
Why?! No matter where Robin is taken to,

228
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,080
we can just keep going after
them until we get her back!

229
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,580
I explained this before we
left Water Seven, didn't I?!

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,210
The only destinations beyond those gates

231
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,460
are Navy Headquarters and the deep-sea prison.

232
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,300
So we have to settle this matter
before that at any cost.

233
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,170
She's right.

234
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,880
That being said, even if we all rush in,

235
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,270
if we encounter CP9, you guys are
the only ones who can defeat them.

236
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,730
After the train ride together, I now
know well how strong you guys are.

237
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,310
So, you guys stay and wait
on the sea for five minutes

238
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,690
and charge in to the main island in
Rocketman through the main gate.

239
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,160
We'll go in first and break open the
main gate and the main island front gate

240
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,240
so that the train can pass through.

241
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:03,200
After that, we'd like you to keep on
moving no matter how many of us fall.

242
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,040
We're only a little over 60 people,

243
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,130
but our enemy's forces are
probably well above 2,000 to 3,000.

244
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,550
We'd like you guys to go after only CP9,
avoiding unnecessary battles.

245
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,010
Okay, got it.

246
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,180
Okay, guys! We're now
at the front of the island!

247
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,100
Take a good look at the sky behind Enies Lobby.

248
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,940
Those are the Gates of Justice.

249
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,860
Whoooa! That's huge!

250
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,250
They never open all the way.

251
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,920
When criminals go through them,
they open just a little.

252
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,260
And, behind those doors is a nest of
large Sea Kings, just like the Calm Belt,

253
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,220
the sea areas that lie on
both sides of the Grand Line.

254
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,680
So no ordinary ships can go in there.

255
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:07,020
I don't know how, but the Navy has a
means of passing through there safely.

256
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,650
In other words, just like the pirate girl said,

257
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,980
if you want to get back
the criminals taken away,

258
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,450
you've got until the moment before
they go through those gates to do it!

259
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,490
Now, there's no time to lose!

260
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,700
Well then, as we planned,
we're gonna go in first!

261
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,710
Leave the backup to us!

262
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,790
Hey, you two! Aren't you
supposed to be with us?!

263
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,180
Hm? Where's Luffy?

264
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,550
What? He was right here up until now.

265
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,640
Hmph!

266
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,480
Is that Straw Hat?

267
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,810
What?!

268
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,150
Oof!

269
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,610
What?!

270
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,490
Why the hell is he doing things on his own?!

271
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,080
That man doesn't have a
clue about the plan at all!

272
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,710
That was a waste.

273
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,540
He said he got it, didn't he?

274
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,420
He's not the type who can wait five minutes.

275
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,750
We should've known.

276
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,550
What an impatient guy he is.

277
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,140
Go! Pirate guy!

278
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,390
Ribbit, ribbit!

279
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,980
Don't fall behind! Sodom! Gomorrah!

280
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,650
Climb up the iron fence and
break open the main gate!

281
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,490
Yeah!

282
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,490
Gum-Gum... Rocket!

283
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,040
Hm? What was that?

284
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,040
I just saw something flying!

285
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,090
Ah!

286
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,260
Whoa! What the heck is this place?!

287
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,140
What a huge hole! It looks
like the island is floating.

288
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,430
I see a town there, too. I wonder
if Robin is around there...

289
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,940
There's someone up there!

290
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,150
It's an intruder! Shoot him down!

291
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,530
Oops, they found me.

292
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,410
He went inside the gate!

293
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,080
This is the main gate! This is the main gate!

294
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,000
This is a report to Chief
and the main island front gate!

295
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,800
This is the main gate! Please come in!

296
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,130
What is it? What's going on?

297
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,880
An intruder went over the main gate

298
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,050
and is currently dashing towards
the main island front gate!

299
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,520
Oh... It's just an intruder.
Calm down and take care of him.

300
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,640
Yes, but...

301
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,110
This is the main island front gate.
We confirmed the intruder.

302
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,780
We'll take care of him right away.
Please do not worry.

303
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,860
Hey, hey. Stop.

304
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,490
Do you know what this place is?

305
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,660
Deal with him carefully. If my eyes
didn't deceive me, that man is...

306
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,460
...Straw Hat Luffy!

307
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,340
What?! What did you just say?!

308
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,760
I think that's Straw Hat...

309
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,350
A pirate with a 100 million-Berry
bounty on his head!

310
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,560
Robin...

311
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,040
Where is Robin?!

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,180
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

313
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

314
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,220
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

315
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,230
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

316
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,520
We'll become No. 1

317
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

318
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,570
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

319
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,740
an era created by risking everything

320
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,860
We always try our best, let's go!

321
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,870
If we want to achieve glory,

322
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,280
now is the time--don't be afraid

323
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

324
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,170
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

325
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,130
We can take off with unknown powers

326
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,380
We don't fear, and we don't waver

327
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,180
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

328
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

329
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

330
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,350
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

331
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,360
Charge ahead

332
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,270
Let's start running towards tomorrow

333
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,240
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

334
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,000
What?! You let Straw Hat
enter the main island?!

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,290
What the hell is going on?!

336
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,750
Outta my way! Outta my way! Clear the way!

337
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,840
Is he trying to pick a fight
with the World Government

338
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,630
just to get one crew
member back?! How stupid.

339
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,430
Robin, just wait!

340
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,050
On the next episode of One Piece!

341
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,430
"Luffy Cuts Through!
Big Showdown on the Judicial Island!!"

342
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,850
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
