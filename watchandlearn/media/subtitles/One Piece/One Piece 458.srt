2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,950
Couldn't eat another bite!

50
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,040
--Look, my stomach is bulging!
--It's the Navy's food and drinks!

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,510
I can't believe that I was thinking "I'll never get out!"

52
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,510
All thanks to...

53
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,560
...Captain Buggy! Thank you!

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,850
No problem! No problem!

55
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,750
So, how's it going, Jimbei?

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,270
Hm?

57
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,330
Don't hm me, you jerk!

58
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,570
I'm asking you when we will get to Navy HQ so I can conquer the world!

59
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,800
That attitude really gets me!

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
I can't stop shaking!

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,870
The Seven Warlords who sold their souls to the Government

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,260
and the 3 navy admirals are no match for us!

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,300
That's right!

64
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,550
You should be the next King of the Pirates because you're following in the wake of Roger!

65
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,140
"A Special Retrospective Before Marineford! The Three Navy Admirals Come Together!"

66
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,020
Meanwhile, at Navy Headquarters in Marineford...

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,120
May I come in?

68
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,490
Everybody, it's time. We need you to come to the harbor with us.

69
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,880
Without "First Son of the Sea" Jimbei who is with Luffy

70
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,340
and Marshall D. Teech who has burst into Impel Down,

71
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,500
4 of The Seven Warlords are about to leave Marie Jois.

72
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,850
In addition, Boa Hancock is here waiting as well

73
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,420
after her stopover at Impel Down.

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,900
4 of these 5 have had dealings with the Straw Hats in the past.

75
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,480
Whitebeard is just a man but you people are beside yourselves with fear.

76
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,190
We still have 3 hours before the execution.

77
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,360
Yes, that's true but we need to be prepared for any contingency.

78
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,530
Bartholomew Kuma!

79
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,290
Ursus Shock!

80
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,230
So, you're still alive, Roronoa...

81
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,110
If you were to take a trip, where would you want to go?

82
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,780
I will protect you, even if it costs me my life!

83
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,200
Damn it!

84
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,910
Luffy... Help m--

85
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,610
Robin!

86
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,800
Luffy!

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,650
We will never meet again.

88
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,860
Farewell...

89
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,140
You look so eager to do it.

90
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,840
You're so uncouth.

91
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,240
Dracule Mihawk AKA "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk!

92
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,090
Is it possible... that's...

93
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,740
...Hawk-Eye...!

94
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,930
I came out to sea to meet you.

95
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,180
What's your goal?

96
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,600
To become the strongest!

97
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,060
How foolish...

98
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
Tiger...

99
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,810
...Trap!

100
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,780
Kid! State your name.

101
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,200
Roronoa Zoro.

102
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,960
I'll remember it, strong one. I haven't seen any one like you in a while...

103
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,510
As a swordsman's courtesy, I'll sink you using the world's strongest black sword.

104
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,640
Three Swords Style Secret Technique!

105
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,260
Fall!

106
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,400
Three Thousand Worlds!

107
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,360
What are you...?

108
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,200
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame...

109
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,580
Admirable!

110
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,230
Zoro!!

111
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,010
Don't live so hastily, young man.

112
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,260
Don't worry. I didn't kill that man.

113
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,230
It's still too early for you to die. My name is Dracule Mihawk!

114
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,190
Learn about yourself! Learn about the world! And become strong!

115
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,690
No matter how many years it takes,

116
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,150
I will hold this seat of the strongest and wait for you.

117
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:02,760
Surpass this sword! Try to surpass me! Roronoa Zoro!

118
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,540
I don't want to get behind!

119
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,400
Being able to steal shadows and corpses of strong men in the world as I please,

120
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,550
it'll be a great war for me!

121
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,560
Gecko Moria!

122
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,900
Now, all the shadows in Thriller Bark,

123
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,480
empower me!

124
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,160
Shadows Asgard!

125
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,920
Gum-Gum...

126
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,960
...Jet Rocket!

127
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,180
Gum-Gum...

128
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,430
Brick Bat!

129
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,320
Black Box!

130
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,650
He got me!

131
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,740
Break into pieces!

132
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,040
This is...

133
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,570
...a baptism for you!

134
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,490
Doflamingo-dono and Hancock-dono, please hurry.

135
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,560
I know. Don't call my name so casually!

136
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,500
Boa Hancock!

137
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,860
For being charmed by me, your guilty consciences...

138
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,320
...will turn your bodies solid!

139
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,620
Love-Love Beam!

140
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,040
Hanco--!

141
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,340
You piss me off!

142
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,720
Big Sis! Stay strong!

143
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:34,600
This can't be! No man exists that won't be my slave!

144
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,780
I cannot stand that man's existence!

145
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,320
Medusa Hair...

146
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,160
...Eight-Headed Serpent!

147
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,750
Medusa Hair...

148
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,790
...Salamander!

149
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,580
Gum-Gum...

150
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
...Jet...

151
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,010
...Gatling!

152
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,640
Ouch! Hot!

153
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,180
That man!

154
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,560
You'd rather die than let people see this, right?!

155
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,960
So don't move!

156
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,330
Luffy! Please be safe!

157
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,730
This is the only one who has never met Luffy or the others.

158
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,190
Don Quixote Doflamingo!

159
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,440
Please! Don't do this anymore! Why're you doing this?!

160
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,520
Because I don't need any punks to work under me, kids.

161
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,670
Augh! Damn! My body is hardening!

162
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,740
Don't do this! Have mercy on me!

163
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,580
No!

164
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,740
O-One more chance...

165
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,890
Give me just one more chance.

166
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,380
I... We will follow you!

167
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,220
Such an eager underling! Don't make me cry.

168
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,000
However, I don't need you to follow me.

169
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,520
Doflamingo!

170
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,330
The day is coming! So hurry and prepare!

171
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,970
For a world where only true pirates can survive!

172
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,770
The powerless should flee!

173
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:02,330
The unstoppable swell of the new era of daring men is coming!

174
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,340
His capability is still unknown.

175
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,390
Also, at the Navy Headquarters,

176
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,870
under the command of Fleet Admiral Sengoku...

177
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,040
You're here! It's time, Aokiji-san!

178
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,670
Oh, it's time for lunch already?

179
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,020
Admiral Aokiji!

180
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,050
Ice Age!

181
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,520
The ocean turns... to ice!

182
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,620
This is what a navy admiral can do.

183
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,050
You got good friends! But you can't change yourself, Nico Robin!

184
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,330
You're wrong! I'm not...

185
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,030
Robin! Look out! Run!

186
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,110
You!

187
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,190
Stop screaming. If you defrost her right, she'll live.

188
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,850
But her body's fragile now so be careful.

189
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,240
If you break her, she'll die. For example...

190
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,370
...if you crush her like this!

191
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,710
No!

192
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,970
T-That was close!

193
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,470
--Yeah!
--You did it, Usopp!

194
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,560
What's going on here?

195
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,070
Usopp! Chopper! Just run to the ship!

196
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,860
Treat her and help her!

197
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,610
G-Got it!

198
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,780
We won't let you...

199
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,320
Wait, guys!

200
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,710
Stand aside. I wanna fight him man-to-man.

201
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,880
Let's sort this out--me and you!

202
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,040
No problem but since there's no ship to take you into custody,

203
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,100
I'll kill you all one by one.

204
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,580
Gum-Gum...

205
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,870
...Storm!

206
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,550
Ice Time!

207
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,690
Not lunch! What are you talking about?!

208
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,570
It's the execution of Portgaz D. Ace...

209
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,220
Yeah, I know. Don't get so uptight.

210
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,420
Please hurry!

211
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,590
Summoning us at lunchtime? So you guys really want to boss us around, huh?

212
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,630
Admiral Kizaru!

213
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,630
Zoro!

214
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,800
Wh-What?! Who are you?!

215
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,940
Get away! Get away from Zoro, you dumbass!

216
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,040
Z-Z-Zoro-san! Zoro-san's been hit by a beam!

217
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,020
Kizaru?!

218
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,240
Be careful! That man is a navy admiral!

219
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,420
Admiral?!

220
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,630
Now you can have a nice, long rest...

221
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,060
Zoro!

222
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,570
Hey! He shoots beams, too! This ain't good! Do something!

223
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,690
At that distance, the beams'll kill him!

224
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,150
Oh no! Zoro's in trouble!

225
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,250
H-Hey, you! Stop that!

226
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,400
Take this!

227
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,160
Take this!

228
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,790
Damn! What's going on?! Why can't I hit him!

229
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,420
I-I can't even stab him! Hold on! What should we do?!

230
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,340
Take this! Dammit!

231
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,560
Move your foot!

232
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,430
Move it aside!

233
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,610
It's no use; I ate the Glint-Glint Fruit, you see.

234
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,180
I'm made of light. I'm a Logia.

235
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,350
Made of light?!

236
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,650
This can't be for real! He's going to die!

237
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,480
Zoro! Run!

238
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,190
Veinte Fleurs!

239
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,040
I won't let you move, either. It's no use.

240
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,090
Now you will die.

241
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,780
You're getting involved in this...

242
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,120
...Dark King Rayleigh?!

243
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,710
Old guy!

244
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,610
Don't be plucking these young sprouts!

245
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,020
Their era is just about to begin!

246
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:16,140
Well I guess if Whitebeard is on the move, it can't be helped!

247
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,810
And the extreme emissary of justice -

248
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,070
Admiral Akainu!

249
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,620
The Navy's greatest powers - the three admirals!

250
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,440
The Seven Warlords of the Sea!

251
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,900
This formidable lineup stands in the way of Luffy who is heading to Marineford!

252
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,060
It's 3 hours to the execution. We'll take the criminal to the scaffold.

253
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,270
It's time.

254
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,590
Fifty battleships and one hundred thousand marines.

255
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:33,340
The Seven Warlords of the Sea and the three admirals, Akainu, Aokiji and Kizaru.

256
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,220
When the world's greatest powers have gathered,

257
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,020
Fleet Admiral Sengoku reveals the shocking truth!

258
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

259
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,980
"Ticking Down to the Time of Battle! The Navy's Strongest Lineup in Position!"

260
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
