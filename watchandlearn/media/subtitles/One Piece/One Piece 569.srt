00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,530
My dreaming heart is huge

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,850
We won’t left anyone behind

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
ichi, ni, Sunshine

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,050
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,520
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,640
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,370
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,860
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,420
On their way to the New World,

74
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,500
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

75
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,670
where they faced the New Fish-Man Pirates
who were looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom

76
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,890
and instigated an all-out war.

77
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,890
The Sea Kings stopped the Noah from
falling onto the Fish-Man Island.

78
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,900
Please help me!

79
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,320
I cannot stop Luffy-sama's bleeding!

80
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,000
Take my blood.

81
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,130
It's F.

82
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,120
You can have as much as you need.

83
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,810
Hey, Jimbei.

84
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,790
Join...

85
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,850
...my crew!

86
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:15,770
"The Secret Revealed! The Truth
about the Ancient Weapon!"

87
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,690
The royal family came to a decision!

88
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,220
Yeah! We are free!

89
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,620
Damn Hordy! Look at yourself!

90
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,840
I thought I was gonna be a slave forever!

91
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,310
Straw Hats! I owe you one!

92
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,770
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

93
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,920
Huh?! That's a bit...

94
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,710
What? I-I'm gonna become king...

95
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,470
Finally I can set sail for the New World!

96
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,990
Are you sure about releasing
Hordy's human slaves?

97
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,200
Their anger against Hordy could
turn towards all Fish-Men.

98
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,680
That is a different story.

99
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,900
This island has always been a place
for pirates to travel and rest.

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,230
And since they meant no harm to us,

101
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,460
there is no reason to hold them here-jamon.

102
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,540
Now, for the rest of the
New Fish-Man Pirates...

103
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,780
--Don't cut my head off!
--P-Please!

104
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,870
We didn't even know that
Hordy killed the Queen!

105
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,550
They're all nuts, really!

106
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,920
--He's right!
--It's Hordy's fault!

107
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,880
We're not responsible!

108
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,650
I order you all to live on this main island!

109
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,530
What?!

110
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,940
What?! Are you telling us
to live law-abiding lives?

111
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,790
It sounds better than working under Hordy.

112
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,290
No way, King-sama! We
don't want them among us!

113
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,090
We can't let our kids walk the streets!

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,100
Of course, I meant they need
to do their time and work

115
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,310
under the supervision of my army-jamon.

116
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,720
I will give you all jobs to use
up your overflowing energy.

117
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,210
From today on, the Fish-Man District

118
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,110
will be sealed off since it
is out of our control-jamon!

119
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,780
The dark side of the Fish-Men was exposed

120
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,450
along with the real killer of Queen Otohime.

121
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,990
A pirate - Hordy Jones attempted
to take over the Fish-Man Island...

122
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,790
...but his plans

123
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,540
were foiled by human pirates who
were just stopping by the island.

124
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,190
Hey, where is Straw Hat Luffy-jamon?

125
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,170
Well... He escaped.

126
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,190
Escaped?!

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,150
Why did you have to leave the plaza
as though you were running away?

128
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,530
Can't you see? We had to fight
with a lot of spectators watching.

129
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,720
If we stayed, they'd treat
us like heroes or something.

130
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,580
Just the thought of it makes me shudder.

131
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,170
Becoming a hero is not a good thing?

132
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,500
Let me tell you something.

133
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,520
A hero is someone who will share
his own sake with other people.

134
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,860
But I wanna drink it all by myself!

135
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,990
Again, that's not how you define a hero!

136
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,010
Why can't you join us, Jimbei?!

137
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,980
Come on an adventure with us!
To the sea! It's gonna be fun!

138
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,590
Yeah, join us, Boss!

139
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,640
It's nice to have  a former Warlord with us!

140
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,240
And Luffy,  you need a complete rest!

141
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,590
As I said, I can't join you right now!

142
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm grateful that you asked me.

143
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,310
I know it'd be fun to sail
the sea with you all.

144
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,590
But I still have things that need to be done.

145
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,220
I have my current responsibilities which

146
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm just taking a break from right now.

147
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,770
When I fulfill my duties
and am free from them,

148
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,900
I promise I will come to see you all again.

149
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,030
And if you haven't changed your mind,

150
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,330
can I take you up on your offer then?

151
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,550
You swear?!

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,050
Whoa whoa, when a man talks about
his "duty," you can't press him.

153
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,130
He likes Jimbei so much!

154
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,320
Luffy thinks so highly of you! So
we're all gonna wait for you, Jimbei!

155
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,100
All right. Thank you!

156
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,860
Now what are we gonna do?
Head for the New World?

157
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,520
What? Are you going to leave the island?!

158
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,280
I couldn't thank you properly
and didn't get to talk to you!

159
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,080
All right! Let's stay at the
Mermaid Cafe for a week or two!

160
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
That'd be just up your alley, wouldn't it?

161
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,840
But I wanna go, too!

162
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,300
Hey, wait!

163
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,630
Who is it?

164
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,010
A soldier of Neptune's army?

165
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,260
Please wait, Straw Hats!

166
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
King Neptune! I caught up with them!

167
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Good.

168
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,030
Luffy-kun, why did you leave?
I wanted to thank you...

169
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,850
I don't wanna be a hero!

170
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,040
I know. Let's just have a banquet!

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,820
The banquet we could not have before-jamon.

172
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,720
A banquet?! Then I'll
be right there! Banquet!

173
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,280
--Meat, meat! I wanna eat!
--Boy! Then why did we leave?

174
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,290
We can't say no to a banquet.

175
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,060
All right! Let's go pick up Hachi and Camie!

176
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,220
The Fish-Man District was sealed
off right away by Neptune's order.

177
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,430
Hordy, the officers of the New Fish-Man
Pirates, and Vander Decken...

178
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,150
...were placed in the Prison Tower.

179
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,740
THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE FISH-MAN ISLAND

180
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,990
Go, Kraken! Take him somewhere far!

181
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,450
Wadatsumi, you don't fit into
any of the cells in the prison!

182
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,080
We forbid you from entering
this country again!

183
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,000
CORAL HILL

184
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,000
Did you catch it?

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
Yeah!

186
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,120
Let's prepare these and
take them to the palace!

187
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,090
They'll have a big banquet
with the Straw Hats!

188
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,340
Count on us!

189
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,510
I heard they like sea monster meat.

190
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,260
Let's take snacks and cakes, too!

191
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,390
CANDY FACTORY TOWN

192
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,390
I heard they eat a lot. Take all we have!

193
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,980
Do they have enough sake?

194
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,560
I want them to have our highest quality sake!

195
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,570
Welcome to the palace-jamon,
Luffy-kun, everybody.

196
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,820
Let's talk later during the banquet.

197
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,160
RYUGU PALACE

198
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,160
The long flounders will take
you to the banquet hall!

199
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,650
--Whew! These rays are huge!
--They're flukes.

200
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,910
He just said "flounders."

201
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,000
It's a dark room filled with water.

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,570
Are we really allowed in? I'm nervous!

203
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,180
I've never entered the palace before.

204
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,600
What's this place? What happened
to the meat and banquet?

205
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,690
Oh, here comes the heroes!

206
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,980
Oh, it's filled with soldiers down there!

207
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,020
Thank you for saving the Fish-Man Island!

208
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,650
We'll never forget what you did for us!

209
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,460
Heroes! Heroes! Heroes! Heroes!

210
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,000
Shut up! Stop calling us
"heroes"! I wanna eat meat!

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,260
He's right! I wanna drink sake!

212
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,800
You idiots...

213
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,970
Luffy-sama! There is a stage
right in front of you!

214
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,640
A stage?

215
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,680
Ladies and gentlemen! Let's start
the banquet with the Straw Hats!

216
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,150
First,

217
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,070
we present you the greatest
diva of the deep sea!

218
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,820
Maria Napole!

219
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,020
And the Swing Jazz Orchestra!

220
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,280
Wow! What a sweet voice!

221
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Wow! Maria-sama!

222
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,980
She is rocking my soul! Oh yeah!

223
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,670
And the special guests!

224
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,040
D-Don't tell me...

225
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,820
Their beauty takes your breath away!

226
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,120
The Mermaid Cafe Dancers!

227
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,460
Shut up!

228
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,980
You're gonna die, Sanji!

229
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,700
Their beauty can't be captured
in a picture! No. 1!

230
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,410
--I'm losing my strength...
--Oh no!

231
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,910
--Awesome!
--Fascinating!

232
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,080
Camie!

233
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,710
Ishilly! I'm glad that you're okay!

234
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,840
Here it comes! There's no
having a banquet without it!

235
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,930
--Super I've been waiting for this!
--That's how the Ryugu Palace should be!

236
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,770
Thank you.

237
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,480
Thanks.

238
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,660
Thank you!

239
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,110
Mermaid-chan!

240
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,950
Thank you very much!

241
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,330
Now, King, will you give a toast?

242
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,380
Before I give a toast, I really want
to express my gratitude briefly-jamon.

243
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,810
All of you Straw Hats!

244
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,900
Thanks to you...

245
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,120
It's banquet time!

246
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,230
Cheers!

247
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,920
Cheers!

248
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,190
Cheers!

249
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,730
All right! Let's drink!

250
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,630
I know, I know. Nobody
wants to hear me-jamon.

251
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,150
Bring the food!

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,390
Meat!

253
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,650
Eat! Sing! Drink! Dance!

254
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,970
Yummy!

255
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,680
We have plenty more.

256
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,130
Oh yeah? Thanks!

257
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,140
I need more obviously!

258
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,940
You eat a lot!

259
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,140
Come on, sisters, dance with me! Here we go!

260
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,590
Let's dance.

261
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,730
--I'll dance.
--I won't.

262
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,400
--Maybe I'll dance.
--I'll dance, so what?

263
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,200
Yum! You have great snacks on this island!

264
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,330
This island's sake is so good!

265
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,010
I already had it once!

266
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,130
I heard you got caught for that!

267
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,590
Forget about those little things!

268
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,350
Bone...

269
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,740
Are you okay, Hero-san?

270
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,260
That bastard, I didn't think of that!

271
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm dying-bone!

272
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,540
Sanji!

273
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,480
You can't push yourself like that, young man!

274
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,440
I think you're gonna die soon.

275
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,200
Nobody cares about me-jamon...

276
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,920
The hairy old man doesn't look happy.

277
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,900
Hey, Straw Hat-san! Don't
be rude to the King!

278
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,770
Luffy-chin! Luffy-chin!

279
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,370
Luffy, raise your glass!

280
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,980
You too, hairy old man!

281
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,370
Uh-huh.

282
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,230
But I want to express my gratitude briefly...

283
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,010
Father-sama!

284
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,510
Shirahoshi.

285
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,590
Cheers!

286
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,890
Cheers-jamon! Oh, whatever-jamon!

287
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,370
Cheers to you guys, too!

288
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,260
Cheers!

289
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,440
It's very good. I wonder if
it's because of the water.

290
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,910
Oh, you can tell the difference, young lady?

291
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,370
I want more!

292
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,030
Why do you look so pale?! It's empty!

293
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,960
I-I can't believe it.

294
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,030
Moonfish! Shake, shake!

295
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,470
Dance more, everybody!

296
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,640
Eat, drink and make some
noise-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do!

297
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,580
What do you want to talk
to me about, pirate girl?

298
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,420
I'm sorry. I thought this was my only
chance to talk to you in private.

299
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,840
What?!

300
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,550
I-I will tell you now!

301
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,050
I have a wife named Otohime
who I swore to love forever!

302
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
Although she is dead, I am
not going to cheat on her...

303
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Who is Joy Boy?

304
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,900
I read the Poneglyph in the Sea Forest.

305
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,550
Who is he apologizing to?

306
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,240
You can read it?

307
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm a survivor of Ohara.

308
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,830
You don't have to tell me
everything if you don't want to.

309
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,210
No.

310
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,870
I will tell you everything I know.

311
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,340
I trust you people.

312
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,250
Joy Boy was a person from
above ground who lived

313
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,290
during the Hundred Year Void-jamon.

314
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,480
That means more than 800 years ago.

315
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,350
That message was written
to a Mermaid Princess

316
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,660
who was on this island at that time-jamon.

317
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,510
It's a letter of apology for not
keeping his promise to the island.

318
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,160
Promise?

319
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
I do not know the details of his promise

320
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:22,760
but they say somebody will come and
fulfill it on behalf of Joy Boy someday.

321
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,760
That is the story handed
down in our royal family.

322
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,850
So we believe the day will come

323
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,540
and have continued

324
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,190
looking after the Noah for generations
just as we promised him.

325
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,400
When the day comes, the Noah will be put

326
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,730
to its true use for the first time-jamon!

327
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,230
I heard when all the battles
came to an end today,

328
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,700
the half-destroyed Noah was
taken to the Sea Forest...

329
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
...by the Sea Kings!

330
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,080
I wonder if Joy Boy had power to

331
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,170
control Sea Kings since he
was going to use the Noah.

332
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,600
No,

333
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,800
the former Mermaid Princess was
the one who had such power-jamon.

334
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,990
That's what I thought.

335
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,280
Then, Princess Shirahoshi
has that same power?

336
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,580
Yes.

337
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,730
I think it awoke completely today.

338
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,780
I am not happy about it.

339
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,570
I know how you feel.

340
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,420
2 years ago at a Sky Island,

341
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,520
I read a Poneglyph indicating where
one of the ancient weapons is.

342
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,920
It was pointing at this island.

343
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,260
The Mermaid Princess who lived
around the same time as Joy Boy...

344
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,310
...was known by a specific name, wasn't she?

345
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:03,440
Since Princess Shirahoshi has the same
power, she will inherit that name.

346
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,740
Another name for her will be...

347
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,390
...the ancient weapon...

348
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,990
...Poseidon!

349
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,490
Jimbei reveals speaks about
two important matters.

350
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,080
After Whitebeard's death, distribution of

351
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,900
power among pirates in the
New World was decided...

352
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,680
...by none other than one
of the Four Emperors.

353
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,600
And a fierce and epic battle
occurred within the Navy.

354
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,580
Its shocking conclusion...

355
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,100
...becomes a big obstacle for
Luffy as he enters the New World.

356
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

357
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,720
"The Straw Hats Stunned! The
New Fleet Admiral of the Navy!"

358
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,910
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
