2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,270
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,570
Luffy is headed to the Navy Headquarters...

51
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,200
...with Ivankov, Jimbei,
Buggy, Crocodile and others,

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,620
in order to rescue his brother,
Ace who is about to be executed!

53
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,580
Meanwhile, the rest of the Straw Hats are...

54
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,290
Is this the fighting costume...

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,920
...that you were talking about?!

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,340
Cute!

57
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,090
Quit it! Shut up!

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,510
How odd! Why can't I land a single blow?!

59
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,720
That's because you have doubt in your heart!

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,810
That can't be it!

61
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,310
Are you sure?!

62
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,520
What?!

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,400
"Dear Nami-san, Robin-chan,
how are you both doing?"

64
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,280
"I'm looking forward to seeing you two!"

65
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,250
"When the time comes, I'm sure
that we'll become good friends!"

66
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,710
There it is! Right there!

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,460
Damn! We're on a cliff!

68
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,180
Are you guys here to save us?!

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,390
I didn't know that she was her baby!

70
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,060
I'm sick of this place!

71
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,700
"The Friends' Whereabouts! Revolutionaries
and the Gorging Forest's Trap!"

72
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,670
EAST BLUE TEQUILA WOLF

73
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,890
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON TOWER

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,890
How do you like the Sea Prism Stone armlet?

75
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,890
It just goes to show there are men...

76
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,940
...who don't have any taste
when it comes to presents.

77
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,520
Out with it! Where are the Straw Hats now?!

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,910
If you're trying to seduce me,
you need to create a better mood.

79
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,030
You bitch!

80
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,810
Nico Robin...

81
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,790
We didn't want that troublemaker here!

82
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,520
I heard that she sank
6 ships when she was only 8.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,010
And I don't think somebody like
her could adjust well to prison.

84
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,680
And if she broke out, she'd
turn this country on its side!

85
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,810
I have to make sure that no one
outside knows who she is...

86
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,480
May I come in?

87
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,190
What's the matter?

88
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,980
It's about the construction delays...

89
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,870
Double the work hours of the laborers!

90
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,820
One meal a day is enough for them!

91
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,480
But they say that there are people
who are opposed to the construction.

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,910
We shouldn't be too strict.

93
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,500
There aren't that many of them
and they can't do anything.

94
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,550
The only threat we have is Nico Ro...

95
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,590
Well, anyway...

96
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,970
You need to see the laborers as expendable!

97
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,850
Hey, don't stop! Pull harder!

98
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,880
Hurry up! We're hungry!

99
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,670
Old man! Are you okay?!

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,010
Why are you goofing around?!
He's dying! Just leave him!

101
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,760
What are you looking at?!

102
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,640
W-What're you guys doing?

103
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,230
H-Hey!

104
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,450
You fools, don't leave your posts!

105
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,780
If you don't wanna work, I can
send you to the prison tower!

106
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,940
The prison tower?

107
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,540
That lady...

108
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,170
It's seawater just like you like!
Taste it to your heart's content!

109
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,630
It's lukewarm.

110
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,760
If we hand you over to a Navy
ship, it'll bring us a fortune!

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,120
Even if you're dead!

112
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,520
What crude pleasure!

113
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,050
Bitch!

114
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,560
Oh boy, the potato skin soup again?

115
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,370
We can't get any energy out of this!

116
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,360
You're cooperative. Have a chocolate, too.

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,610
Thank you, mister!

118
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,620
Humph! Informant!

119
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,950
I did it to survive! You're not getting any!

120
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,410
Old lady!

121
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,370
You can't have this!

122
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,680
Leave her alone!

123
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,830
The lady that you took the trouble to save...

124
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,480
...was sent to the tower
because she snitched!

125
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,050
That young lady gave herself
up in order to save us.

126
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,890
She's a strong woman. She'll
forgive the old lady!

127
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,900
Why are you here?!

128
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,280
This is mine!

129
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,000
I-I wanted to get out of here!
I don't feel sorry at all!

130
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
Uh-huh.

131
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,090
You can have this.

132
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,720
Thank you!

133
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,470
Old lady, you're kind!

134
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,190
I'm sorry! But I couldn't help it!

135
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,880
We're all helpless!

136
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,860
We have to stay here and suffer
for the rest of our lives!

137
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,910
I haven't say "thank you" to that lady.

138
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,710
I want to give this chocolate to her.

139
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,040
What are you doing?! Get back to work!

140
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,250
Here's your meal!

141
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,340
Finish it then we'll start questioning again!

142
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,760
Can't wait.

143
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,640
Sounds like you have been
hurt bad, young girl.

144
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,660
Who are you?

145
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,650
I'm just an old man. I was
sent to this country today

146
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,610
but they said that the elderly
are useless and put me in here.

147
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,960
I'm sorry about that.

148
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,450
I...

149
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,680
I have no time to waste!

150
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,060
I've got to get out of here!

151
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,820
Even it means that I have to cut my arms off!

152
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,530
Young girl, don't feel so pressed!

153
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,590
Listen carefully.

154
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,200
Don't you hear something?!

155
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,910
What's the matter?

156
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,540
What's that?!

157
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,500
Dissidents are running wild!

158
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,380
The warden ordered all of
us to go and break it up!

159
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,440
Lady!

160
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,560
Lady!

161
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,690
Lady, where are you?

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,990
--Lady!
--Soran!

163
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,320
Lady! I just wanted to thank you...

164
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,700
What are you doing there?!

165
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,330
Dissidents?

166
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,620
Yes, but as you ordered,

167
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,750
all teams went to break it up
so it didn't become serious!

168
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,160
I didn't give that order.

169
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:07,970
Don't tell me that you even sent the
security soldiers stationed at the tower!

170
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,100
Lady!

171
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,840
Soran! How did you get here?

172
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,730
I'm an agent of the revolutionary army!

173
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,820
Are you alright? The diversion went well!

174
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,860
Good job!

175
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,660
With your command, we can win!

176
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,060
Yeah, you can count on me!

177
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,450
Oh yeah!

178
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,630
While you're at it, free
that young girl, too.

179
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,170
Hey lady, you're in luck!

180
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,090
Thanks.

181
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,330
You fool! I don't care about the dissidents!

182
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,890
Look out for Nico Robin!

183
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,100
This doesn't fit, either.

184
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,470
Young girl, it's gonna be messy for awhile.

185
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,940
Why don't you hide somewhere safe?

186
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,520
I don't want you to slow us down.

187
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,070
What?!

188
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,530
Oh no!

189
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,370
Nico Robin! Shoot her to death!

190
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Clutch!

191
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,810
You are Nico Robin?!

192
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,190
I owe the people here!

193
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,610
I have to pay them back!

194
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,850
The woman in the tower has broken
out and is coming after us!

195
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,410
Help me!

196
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,160
--W-Warden!
--Robin... Robin is coming!

197
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,330
It's over! Everything's over!

198
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,750
Nico Robin!

199
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,540
You have a nice name!

200
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,130
Luffy-kun, you need to rest if only a little.

201
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,500
Yeah. Thank you.

202
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,010
But I'm okay.

203
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,310
The wind has died down.

204
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,120
Even though we are moving
forward with the current,

205
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,900
we may not arrive in time.

206
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,490
Luffy-kun!

207
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,080
No. I should not give him needless anxiety.

208
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:27,060
When we get to Navy Headquarters, he will
get involved in an unimaginable war!

209
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,640
Ace!

210
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,530
GRAND LINE BOWIN ISLANDS

211
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,530
It's a man-eating sunflower!

212
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,950
And my name is Heracles'n!

213
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,370
Heracles'n!

214
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,830
Help me!

215
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,980
Hera...

216
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,070
I said "help!" I'm sick of this!

217
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,250
Why?! Why are you depressed?

218
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,500
Sleeping sulkily?!

219
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,140
Help me, Heracles! You're
the hero of the forest!

220
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,720
The hero... of the forest?

221
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,600
Yes, you're the strong, cool hero!

222
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,230
I'm the hero of the forest--Heracles'n!

223
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,230
Wow! Cool!

224
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,030
Usopp'n! I'm coming for you'n!

225
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,450
Heracles!

226
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,110
Look out!

227
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,500
Heracles! Heracles! Heracle...

228
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,010
What... are... you... doing?!

229
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,240
--Whiz!
--Whiz!

230
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,870
--Zunk!
--Zunk!

231
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,220
I'm alive!

232
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,930
But why're they attacking just me?

233
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,230
To survive on this island, you need
to look sharp and have stamina'n!

234
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,650
You're the weakest one on this island
now! Ants and worms are better than you!

235
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,900
Screw you! I'm stronger
than ants and worms...

236
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,160
Huge!

237
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,660
Huge!

238
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,210
--Wanna eat this'n?
--Yeah, right'n!

239
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,080
You need to build up stamina if
you don't wanna get beat up'n!

240
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,130
I know! But there's nothing
here that I really wanna eat!

241
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,930
Oh, I'm hungry!

242
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,180
Oh well'n.

243
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,480
Are you sure that there are
things to eat beyond this?

244
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,850
Yes, those are too good so be careful'n!

245
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,800
Wow!

246
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,500
What the hell is this place?!

247
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,120
Smells so good! Yeah, I
think I can eat these!

248
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,540
Ramen Falls! Spaghetti Patches!

249
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,580
Ham Fruits! Chocolat Rocks for dessert!

250
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,300
You can eat whatever you see!

251
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,560
Oh, can I eat these?!

252
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,790
--Go ahead'n.
--Yum-yum!

253
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:10,270
Eat a lot and build your stamina, then
the man-eating plants won't attack you'n!

254
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,230
Yeah? That's great!

255
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,150
These are really good,
I can eat these forever!

256
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,780
Don't just eat'n! You need to work out, too!

257
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,100
I know! But I need to eat a lot...

258
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,450
...to become a cool hero of
the forest like you, right?

259
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,240
You wanna become a hero, too?

260
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,640
We're the heroes of the forest Heracles'n!

261
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,580
And Usopp'n!

262
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,350
U-Usopp'n! Oh?

263
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,010
Usopp'n! Where'd you go'n?!

264
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,390
Wow! This is good, too!

265
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,230
I can eat this even if I'm full!

266
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,480
That way'n?

267
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,190
This is too good! I can't stop!

268
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,520
Usopp'n! Where are you'n?

269
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,320
If you eat too much, you're
gonna be in big trouble'n!

270
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,740
I can't control my hands! I can't stop!

271
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,830
There you are, finally!

272
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,380
What do you think, Heracles'n?

273
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,710
Now I can become the hero of the forest!

274
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,910
Usopp'n! You're way too big!

275
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,260
You'd better work off some calories
or you're gonna be in big trouble!

276
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,780
What's this? An earthquake?

277
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,420
It's beginning!

278
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,060
Whoa, w-what a huge mouth!

279
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,460
Don't wanna fall! Don't wanna fall!

280
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,260
--Usopp'n!
--Heracles!

281
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,140
--Wow!
--Too heavy!

282
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,770
Hey!

283
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,690
Hera!

284
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,110
Goodbye, Usopp'n.

285
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,640
So this is goodbye?!

286
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,780
Oh, ramen!

287
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,600
Usopp'n!

288
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,720
Sup!

289
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,880
I can't eat anymore!

290
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,190
Usopp'n!

291
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,070
Fat things will surely be
eaten on this island'n!

292
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,390
Surely be eaten?!

293
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,030
It's impossible to escape
from here - Bowin Islands!

294
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,030
Impossible to escape?!

295
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,990
And I'm the hero of the forest H...

296
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,210
Zoro wanders the island with Perona

297
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,880
in hopes of reuniting with their friends.

298
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,530
When Zoro gets lost as always,
a mysterious shadow attacks!

299
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,460
Around that time,

300
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,730
Brook is trying to repay his panty debt!

301
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,170
On the next episode of One Piece!

302
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,150
"The Friends' Whereabouts! A
Huge Tomb and the Panty Debt!"

303
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
