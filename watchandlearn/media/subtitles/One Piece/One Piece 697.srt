00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,060
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,130
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,250
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,780
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,040
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

83
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,200
On top of that, he put prices on
the heads of Luffy and 11 others,

84
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,750
and now they're being hunted
by all the citizens.

85
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,380
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

86
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,270
Luffy and Law are heading
to the Royal Palace!

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,590
All right!
Let's go and kick Mingo's ass!

88
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,090
Wait!

89
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,200
What?!

90
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,630
Doflamingo isn't someone
that you can beat just by force of will alone.

91
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,460
You need to cool down.

92
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,030
What?! How can I cool down
after getting this far?!

93
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,620
I'm saying, if you don't,
you can't defeat him!

94
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,230
I promised Rebecca!

95
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,140
Stopping here won't change anything!

96
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,660
Law and Straw Hat have shown up
in the yard...

97
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,030
...nearby the pool.

98
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,830
--Roger that.
--Clank.

99
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,790
I spent such a long time,
increasing their number little by little.

100
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,460
Those tens of thousands of toy slaves.

101
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,340
But that idiot...

102
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,300
...brought it all to naught in an instant!

103
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,520
Not yet, Kanjuro?! We have no time!

104
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,400
It's almost done!

105
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,400
Revenge is easy.

106
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,410
Just touch them with this hand.

107
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Straw Hats...

108
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,080
Now I'll bring...

109
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
...your existences...

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,320
...to naught!

111
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,460
"One Shot One Kill!
The Man Who Will Save Dressrosa!"

112
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,530
Okay, this is it! It's done!

113
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,680
Sorry to keep you waiting, Usopp-dono.

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,950
--It's a work after my own heart.
--Oh, it's done?!

115
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,410
Looks good! Well done, well done!

116
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,590
O-Oh yeah?

117
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,130
To me, it kind of looks terrible again...

118
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,920
Terrible but fine!
I'll use it!

119
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,010
Keep going, keep going!

120
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,430
Don't fall!

121
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,300
Catch the king!

122
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,750
It's done!

123
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,190
That's your ammunition?!

124
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,230
Yes, I'll call it "Bagworm"!

125
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,400
It's the special attack we need
to take down Sugar!

126
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,340
Viola!

127
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm counting on your Clairvoyance.

128
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,750
Tell me every move Sugar makes.

129
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,400
Okay.

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,970
Can you really do it
with only her Clairvoyance?

131
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,520
I have no other options.
Sugar is already on the move.

132
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,860
I'm a sniper!

133
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,590
Covering someone is what I do best!

134
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,060
Shoot an enemy without being seen
to protect my friend!

135
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,910
Viola. I'm counting on you.

136
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,100
Yes.

137
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,860
Sugar's walking towards those two!

138
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay!

139
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,010
--Captain Tank! Hack!
--Yes, King Riku-sama!

140
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,310
Give me a hand! We'll protect Usopp-kun!

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,730
Father-sama!

142
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,750
The people are getting really close.

143
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,930
Everybody's confused.

144
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,470
They might come after me, too.

145
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,430
Stop! Please!

146
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,520
But don't hurt anyone.

147
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,330
That's very hard.

148
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,940
But we've got to do it.

149
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes,

150
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,780
us hurting our people is
exactly what Doflamingo wants.

151
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,540
All we need to do now is
buy time for the launch.

152
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,620
Old king man, thanks!

153
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,800
Usopp-kun!

154
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,910
Sugar is getting closer to those two!

155
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,140
Now, she can see them!

156
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,440
Keep your eye on her!

157
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,990
Made it!

158
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,450
There!

159
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,080
King Riku!

160
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,620
Viola-sama!

161
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,000
Kin'emon!

162
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,500
God Usopp!

163
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,140
Catch them all and
hand them over to Doflamingo!

164
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,680
--Coming!
--Yeah!

165
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,720
Listen, don't hurt anyone!

166
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,270
Now they're here!

167
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,230
--We have to stop them, too!
--Okay!

168
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,860
THE ROYAL PALACE - THE POOL GARDEN

169
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,990
"Kicking someone's ass" is your answer
to everything!

170
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,580
What's wrong with that?!
It's easier that way!

171
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,020
Neither Trafalgar Law nor
Monkey D. Luffy know me.

172
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,130
It's easy to approach them.

173
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,100
What the...

174
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,150
Sugar came out into the yard!

175
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,740
The time has come!

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,080
Excuse me, help!

177
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,640
Why is a kid here?

178
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,690
Dad! Mom! Where are you?!

179
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,240
Don't tell me she's lost.

180
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,880
In such a place? No way!

181
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,770
--Are you lost?
--Don't pay attention to her.

182
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,480
I don't like this man!

183
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,350
Let's go.

184
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,340
It's dangerous here
so hide somewhere.

185
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:41,070
No! Don't leave me alone!

186
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,280
Luffy!

187
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,150
Everyone, listen! None of us will run!

188
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,280
--Stop right there!
--Father-sama!

189
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,780
Guys, come to your senses!

190
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,600
I won't let you get near Usopp-dono
at any cost!

191
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,970
Stop! Hold it, hold it!

192
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,280
--Stay focused!
--I'm sorry!

193
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,480
Tell me the exact location of the yard!

194
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,650
See the windows on the upper
part of the Rampart Tower?

195
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,370
Yeah.

196
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,850
I see Straw Hat and Law
in the first window right of the center.

197
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,290
There are iron bars on the window.

198
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,510
How many bars are there?

199
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,930
One vertical bar and
three horizontal bars.

200
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,180
The length from the ground
of the yard to the bottom

201
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,320
of the window is about 1.2 meters.

202
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,280
That's about Sugar's height.

203
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,780
How big is the bottom pane
of the window?

204
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,700
50 wide by 40 high.

205
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,000
It's about the size of the ammo...

206
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,170
Where is Sugar now?

207
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,180
She's still behind the post.

208
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,770
Leave her.

209
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,980
Help, please!

210
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,690
Sorry, we've got to get going.

211
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,640
No! Don't leave me!

212
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,780
You can have these!

213
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,690
What?

214
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,580
Sugar is gonna get between
the two any minute.

215
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,040
Get out of our way!

216
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,430
Everybody, stop!

217
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,100
The target is behind the wall...

218
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,720
If I miss, we'll lose Luffy!

219
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,730
You can have these. They're good!

220
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,020
What?! Is it okay?!

221
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,920
Uh-huh!

222
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,940
Forget it!

223
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,570
What's your problem?!
She said I can have some!

224
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,640
Sugar came into the center of the pane!

225
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,230
She's approaching them!

226
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,690
Usopp-kun?!

227
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,630
I-I can't...

228
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,940
...stop shaking!

229
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,520
Dammit!!

230
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,100
What?

231
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,820
Luffy!!

232
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,270
I'll hit her no matter what!

233
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,710
Hey, Luffy!

234
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,140
The seas without you,
I don't ever wanna see that!

235
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,610
Who will save this country?!

236
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,040
You'll see it, Sugar!

237
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,300
I won't let you guys...

238
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,710
...have it all your way!

239
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,020
What's... going on?

240
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,490
I see the aurac

241
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,660
...of their presences!

242
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,750
There's Luffy!

243
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,340
Here I go!

244
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,800
Super Grown-Up Great Black Kabuto!

245
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,930
Special Long-Range Attack! Bagworm!

246
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,360
The wind is blowing from west to east...

247
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,070
Wind force scale: 4.

248
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,460
A slight tailwind.

249
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,960
We got him!

250
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,400
Two...

251
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,550
One...

252
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,740
The first booster, Exploding Star!

253
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,640
Slight ascent, then,
release the rear section.

254
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,930
Two seconds later,
ignite the second booster.

255
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,180
The outer-cover comes off
and the ammo goes horizontally.

256
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,530
It's gonna go through the lower left side of

257
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,160
the window on the Rampart Tower!

258
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,330
It passes through the wall
and goes straight!

259
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,700
Straight to the target!

260
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,910
What?

261
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,500
It trails off a little but
that special ammo is...

262
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,600
...meant to retraumatize the enemy!

263
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,400
AAAAARGH!

264
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,610
Luffy, you don't even have to notice...

265
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,390
If you're all right,

266
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,910
just go ahead!

267
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,390
But, Usopp-dono, what are you
going to do with this drawing?

268
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,590
Can you turn it into a real object?

269
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,390
An object?

270
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,440
Do it! It's gonna be an ammunition!

271
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,870
Sugar-sama!

272
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,040
Oh no! She passed out again!

273
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,740
What?!

274
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,070
They stopped!

275
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,630
--Why're they going down themselves?!
--The toys...

276
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,610
What happened?

277
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,350
I'm amazed, Usopp-kun...
You're such a brilliant sniper!

278
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,550
Viola-sama?

279
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,360
You did it!
You brought down Sugar!

280
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,360
Usopp-kun!

281
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,950
Did he really?! I can't believe it!

282
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,290
--I'm stunned!
--Did he really do it?!

283
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,270
Great...

284
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,150
How are they?

285
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,570
They are both okay.

286
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,060
Sugar-sama!

287
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,470
Let's go!

288
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,200
We're here, Mingo!

289
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,410
They've just made it there!

290
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,790
To the top floor of the Palace
where the decisive battle will take place!

291
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,440
I see...

292
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,470
You did it, Luffy!

293
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,790
Let me just make sure.

294
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,560
Just in case, I'm wrong.

295
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,330
You two,

296
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,070
what did you come here for?

297
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,950
To kick your ass!

298
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,700
The same here!

299
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,040
I'm disappointed...

300
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,340
Luffy and Law finally come face-to-face with
their sworn enemy, Doflamingo!

301
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,090
Provoking the two cunningly and
leading them around by the nose,

302
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,660
Doflamingo launches vicious attacks
against them manipulating Bellamy,

303
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,180
and when Luffy's anger hits its peak,

304
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,350
Luffy and Law strike a
blow with all their might!

305
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

306
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,770
"Anger Erupts! Luffy and Law's Ultimate Stratagem!"

307
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,190
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
