00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,130
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,270
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,640
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

9
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

10
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

11
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,480
After surviving a fierce battle,

12
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

13
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,570
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

14
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,900
After receiving an emergency signal,
they landed on Punk Hazard;

15
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,240
an island with two parts,  one
burning, the other frozen.

16
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,920
A branch of the Navy - G-5
- led by Smoker reached

17
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,450
the island while chasing after the Straw Hats

18
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,620
and got into a fight with Trafalgar
Law who appeared out of nowhere.

19
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,420
Scalpel!

20
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,100
My heart!

21
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,270
The Master was our warm-hearted savior!

22
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,740
Master!!

23
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,490
Punk Hazard is our Master's property now!

24
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,280
Rejoice!

25
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
The Master is still doing research
today for the future of mankind!

26
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,510
He needs only a few guinea
pigs and you can become one!

27
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,810
You can't get away!

28
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,330
"Chopper's Fury! The Master's
Inhumane Experiment!"

29
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,940
THE REMAINS OF THE FIRST
AND SECOND LABORATORY

30
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,940
Master!

31
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,610
What a great guy!

32
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,700
Yes, the Master is a wonderful person.

33
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,680
The Master is super!

34
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,870
--He's merciful!
--The human race's last hope!

35
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,470
We don't know him that well.

36
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,590
Hey, are you listening?

37
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,670
--We!
--Love!

38
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,580
Master... Wow!

39
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,490
What the hell?!

40
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,910
I got puffed up!

41
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,890
A fuzzball!

42
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,010
That's Guard Boost! You can
turn into six forms at will.

43
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,500
--What an unstable body!
--Get used to it.

44
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,310
You fools! Stop playing with my body!

45
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,260
What?! The samurai left?!

46
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,890
Yes.

47
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,160
Damn! I thought he was too quiet!

48
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,060
When I said I saw a torso earlier,

49
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,710
he asked me where in detail.

50
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,830
I told him I lost it around the
lake and he went storming off.

51
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,130
I wasn't paying attention being
fascinated with Nami-san's sexy body!

52
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,880
Why does it matter to you?

53
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,540
He was only a head and couldn't move.

54
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,770
I'm the one who brought him with us.

55
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,740
I couldn't leave him alone
so I'm responsible for him.

56
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,520
If something happens to him, it's my fault.

57
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
I see. Although he is a samurai,

58
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,760
he can't use a sword without his
torso so all he can do is run.

59
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,740
Do you wanna go honor your responsibility?

60
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,410
Boy, that fool!

61
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,830
Luffy, I'll be right back, okay?

62
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,130
Yeah, okay!

63
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,720
I'll show you the way so...
can I see your panties?

64
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,970
Of course! Oh yeah, let's get a camera!

65
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,140
Wait, you fools!

66
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,280
Zoro, you gotta go with them!

67
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,690
If Zoro is there, Sanji-kun will
be arguing with him all the time!

68
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,150
Because you're such an idiot,

69
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,650
I was forced to go look for the
stinking samurai, too, you perv!

70
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,610
Do you think I wanted this?!

71
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,080
I don't wanna be with a dumb-ass who
I can't share this happiness with!

72
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,130
She only hit me.

73
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,040
Are you all worrying if my bones got broken?

74
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,010
No, the only thing that was broken
is my will to see panties.

75
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,680
They look so happy.

76
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,670
Yeah, they're full of energy.

77
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,430
They don't look like they're sick at all.

78
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm gonna look into their sickness.

79
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,530
Is there anything I can do?

80
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,560
There is. I need samples of their sweat.

81
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,080
Can you collect some for me?

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,910
All done!

83
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,710
Sis.

84
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,090
Mocha.

85
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,510
Do you think I'm gonna get better?

86
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,980
Do you think I can see my dad and mom?

87
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,810
Don't worry.

88
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,730
I will take you back to
your family at any price.

89
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,850
Uh-huh.

90
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,590
Now, let's talk about what we are gonna do.

91
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,990
First of all, get us back to
normal as soon as possible!

92
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,460
I don't wanna be a pervert anymore!

93
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,120
Hey, hey, you're overpraising me!

94
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,090
Don't ever smile like that
with Chopper's face! Ever!

95
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,380
But what should we do with those brats?

96
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,880
They're such a pain in the ass!

97
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,430
Franky, I don't want you to say a
single word while you're in his body.

98
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,250
Ever!

99
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,820
Let's have a snowball fight, Synd!

100
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,780
What's the matter? Are you okay?

101
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,200
I can't breathe...

102
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,800
What's wrong? Synd, you're acting strange.

103
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
No...

104
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,210
This can't be!

105
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
How is it going, Racoon-chan?

106
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,640
Well, we'll see soon.

107
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,300
What?! This is...

108
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,070
What's wrong, Synd?

109
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,840
Are you in pain?

110
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,580
Are you okay?

111
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,240
What? What?

112
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,390
I can't breathe!

113
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,420
Chopper, he's saying he can't breathe.

114
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,620
Help him.

115
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,610
Mocha!

116
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,040
What happened, everybody?!

117
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,260
Dolan, too?!

118
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,340
They're collapsing! Mostly the giant ones!

119
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,510
What's going on?!

120
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,690
Chopper, what was it? Are they really sick?

121
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,690
No.

122
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,480
What?

123
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,490
Synd, is there something you want now?

124
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,700
What do you usually do at this time of day?

125
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,490
Usually?

126
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,740
We have a checkup and...

127
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,790
...after that...

128
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,540
What do you do after that?

129
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,040
I get a candy.

130
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,790
A candy?

131
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,210
It tastes good.

132
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,470
We all love that candy.

133
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,550
And it's fun, too.

134
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,970
What?

135
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,220
Because smoke comes out of it.

136
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,600
Oh yeah... When I eat that candy...

137
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,910
When I eat that candy,
I... I feel happy so...

138
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,070
...that might help me now!

139
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,450
Was your name Brownbeard?

140
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,230
What do you know about this?!

141
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,750
These children are not sick!

142
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,380
What are you saying?

143
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,510
I work outside so I don't know much
about what's going on in the laboratory

144
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,840
but those brats have an intractable disease!

145
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,290
Kids, stay with us!

146
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,520
Hey Chopper, even the smaller
ones are suffering now!

147
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,690
What the hell is this Master guy thinking?!

148
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,710
What do you mean by that?

149
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,780
Do you have a problem with our Master?

150
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,910
The merciful Master was
kind enough to take them in

151
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,790
and try to save them with
his medicinal skills!

152
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,910
He's a scientist of love!

153
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,140
--I can't breathe!
--Ally!

154
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,300
Look! In fact, they're suffering now
because they left the laboratory

155
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,800
and they haven't gotten
their treatment for today!

156
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,880
You're wrong!

157
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,470
Chopper, did you find out something?!

158
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,250
NHC10.

159
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,230
I detected it in their body.

160
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,480
Although it was just a trace amount, it's...

161
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,000
...a drug!

162
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,280
A drug?!

163
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,370
Only select doctors in a few
countries are allowed to use it!

164
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,730
I knew about it because
Doctrine was using it.

165
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,790
Even for its intended
purpose - to cure diseases,

166
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,680
it's used sparingly because
it's highly addictive!

167
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,620
These children were taking a
small amount of it everyday

168
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,090
and became chronically addicted.

169
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,490
They crave another dose to ease the pain.

170
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,440
Why is he doing this to
these little children?!

171
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,610
So they can't get out of the lab?!

172
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,610
What does your "savior" want to do...

173
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,120
...with these poor children?!

174
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,700
Hey, stop slandering our
Master or I'll beat you up!

175
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,590
Chopper! What should we do?!

176
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,140
The kids are collapsing one after another!

177
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,290
The candy...

178
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,840
The candy...

179
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,380
Do you want a candy?

180
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,810
Do you want me to go get it from the lab?

181
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,510
No!

182
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,220
We can never let them eat that candy again!

183
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,470
I guess they were ingesting the
drug like that without knowing!

184
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,810
Straw Hat bro!

185
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,590
Are you gonna go get me the candy?

186
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,440
No, I can't! If Chopper says "No," I can't!

187
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,990
He is our doctor. Trust him!

188
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,630
Why?

189
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,280
Why?!

190
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,750
Why?!

191
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,360
What happened to you, Synd?!

192
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,370
I'm scared!

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,420
You said you're gonna go get it for me!

194
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,110
You said you're gonna get it!

195
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,640
You said you're gonna go get it for me!!

196
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,310
Luffy!

197
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,140
Where is this strength coming from?!

198
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,100
Synd, stop!

199
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,940
I've never seen Synd get so violent!

200
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,540
What power!

201
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,630
It's no wonder if he's a Giant!

202
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,840
That strong?!

203
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,930
Why can't I have the candy?!

204
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,140
--Synd is not a Giant!
--What?!

205
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,770
When we came to this island,
we were all normal-sized.

206
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,690
I thought we had a disease
which makes us grow too big.

207
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,950
There's nothing wrong
with us other than that!

208
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,490
There isn't such a disease that'd
turn an ordinary person into a Giant!

209
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,100
Big people are big from the beginning!

210
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,670
Those of us who've been here
longer have a bigger body!

211
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,160
That means...

212
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,500
...they didn't always have a problem with
the oversecretion of pituitary hormones.

213
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,550
The candy!

214
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,710
The candy!

215
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,470
These children are...

216
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,640
…test subjects!

217
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,220
The candy!

218
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,720
Don't lose your mind, Ally!

219
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,520
I want the candy!

220
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,240
What does the Master guy want?

221
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,360
By manipulating such little
children with drugs?

222
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,530
The candy!

223
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,370
Other kids are losing it, too!

224
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,420
We can't do anything!

225
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,760
Nami!

226
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,180
--Synd, don't!
--Hey, can I stop him?!

227
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,650
No! Move out of my way, Luffy!

228
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,890
Usopp, don't hurt them!

229
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,810
Dammit! I know!

230
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,110
Special Attack - Sleep Star!

231
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,550
All right! They are all sleeping now.

232
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,730
So they were all kidnapped as I thought.

233
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,980
Get us out of here!

234
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,740
I want to see my father and my mother!

235
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,410
Luffy.

236
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,120
These kids are going through
such a horrible ordeal...

237
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,330
...without knowing anything
and it breaks my heart!

238
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,310
They said they want to go
home and see their parents!

239
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,010
We've got to help them!

240
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:40,140
Luffy! I wanna help them, too!

241
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,430
Alright, let's take them
all to their parents.

242
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,600
Fool! It's not that easy! We
have a mountain of problems.

243
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,620
He's right. Plus, it's just speculation now.

244
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,860
Nothing can be solved until
we see the ringleader.

245
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,910
The Master guy, huh?

246
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,950
But Zoro, Sanji, and Brook went
out looking for the samurai so...

247
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,920
Well, that's okay!

248
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,250
All right!

249
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,750
Let's go to the laboratory to see the Master!

250
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,590
--I'll stay here.
--What?

251
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,180
I really can't stomach what
the Master guy is doing

252
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,470
and I wanna kick his ass!

253
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,310
But I can't leave these kids
here. I have to look after them.

254
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,550
Y-Yeah, h-he's right!
Then, I'll stay here, too!

255
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,360
Hey, Nami! That's not
fair! You're just scared!

256
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,260
But it'll be crazy if they go wild again.

257
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,240
Let's leave the big ones like this.

258
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,330
I feel a little bad about this.

259
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,420
We have no choice. They go wild
like heavyweight fighters.

260
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,210
And we don't know when they're gonna wake up.

261
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,970
What should we do about the
body shuffle situation?

262
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,000
I assume we can't go back to
normal unless the four of us

263
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,680
see Trafalgar together.

264
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,000
Why bother? Just leave it like it is.

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,120
No way! You gotta make it right!

266
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,940
The Master is a warm-hearted savior.

267
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,600
I trust you, Master!

268
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,750
Hey! Samurai-san!

269
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,800
Where are you?!

270
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,850
If only we could find traces
of his wooden clogs.

271
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,380
So heavy!

272
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,880
My breasts are heavy when I run!

273
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,300
I thought you wanted to save that samurai!

274
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,850
Oh no!

275
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,930
How romantic!

276
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,560
No, fool!

277
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,480
I don't care if you fall down!

278
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,640
You jerk! Treat Nami-san's
body more carefully!

279
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,400
Hey, you two! Take a look at this!

280
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,730
There is a footprint!

281
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,690
A trace of his wooden clogs?

282
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,280
It's nothing like that!

283
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,410
Then, it must be some centaur's footprint.

284
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,270
No!

285
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,610
Th-This is...

286
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,180
The Navy G-5 Vice Admiral Smoker's heart!

287
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,140
What a nice gift, Law.

288
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,150
The fight is over.

289
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,040
Since they lost their warship,

290
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,530
they will come to steal our
ship here to make a report.

291
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,780
Of course, that's already been taken care of.

292
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,020
What about Straw Hat-ya's group?

293
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,620
Don't worry about them, either.

294
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,720
We will get rid of them soon
and take back those kids.

295
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,820
I mean, I know those brats will have an

296
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,140
urge to come back here even
if we don't do anything.

297
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,440
But since Monet told me to be
careful with the Straw Hats,

298
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,240
I sent those two just to make sure.

299
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,860
They never miss their target!

300
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,910
The Snow Mountain Killers!

301
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,660
Yeti...

302
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,250
...Cool Brothers!

303
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,300
There are six more.

304
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,790
I thought they would be stronger than that.

305
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,020
Let's just finish them all off.

306
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,190
Like we took down those three...

307
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,420
We'll do it in a cool way!

308
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,460
Luffy and crew hurry to the
laboratory to see the Master.

309
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,050
In their absence, Nami and Chopper
stay behind to watch the children,

310
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,390
when suddenly, invisible assassins attack!

311
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,690
By the time Luffy realizes what's going on,

312
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,980
the two are facing a life-or-death situation.

313
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,490
On the next episode of One Piece!

314
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,710
"To Annihilate the Straw Hats!
Legendary Assassins Descend!"

315
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
