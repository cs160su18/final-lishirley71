2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,740
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,270
Luffy comes to rescue his brother Ace
who has been captured by the Navy

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,660
by sneaking into Impel Down - the
greatest prison in the world!

52
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,510
Ace-san.

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,830
What did she just tell you?

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,670
She said that my brother's here!

55
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,260
Swan Arabesque!

56
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,140
It's been a long time! Straw-chan, it's me!

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,600
"Warden Magellan's Strategy!
Straw Hat Entrapment Completed!"

58
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,690
Gum-Gum...

59
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,400
...Whip!

60
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,830
Gum-Gum...

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,860
...Gatling!

62
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,710
Spin, spin!

63
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,300
The following prisoners seem to be
helping the invader - Straw Hat Luffy:

64
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,760
Prisoner number E-8200:
Pirate - Buggy the Clown.

65
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,270
Prisoner number D-0464:
Former Baroque Works agent -

66
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,570
Galdino, A.K.A. Mr. 3.

67
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,320
Prisoner number C-9915:
Former Baroque Works agent -

68
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,620
Bentham, A.K.A. Mr. 2 Bon Clay.

69
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,170
Straw Hat Luffy and Mr. 2 Bon Clay
are now in district N on level 3.

70
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,540
The Blugoris are having
trouble subduing them!

71
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,760
Hey, Bon-chan! How can we
get to the lower levels?

72
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,720
There are stairs at the opposite side!

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,100
Nice! I'm so glad to see
you, Bon-chan! Thank you!

74
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,220
You needn't thank me!

75
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,310
We were destined to see each other again!

76
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,860
It seems like they're heading
to the staircase to level 4.

77
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,830
Meanwhile, we lost track of the other
two, Buggy the Clown and Galdino - Mr. 3.

78
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,420
There is a riot going on level 2 and
the invader is still on the loose!

79
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,920
This is getting interesting!

80
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,470
This is a good way to kill time!

81
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,300
They'll get caught and it'll be over soon!

82
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,530
--Thank you for being understanding.
--No problem.

83
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,040
Here is your cloak.

84
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,130
--Thank you for everything.
--M-My pleasure!

85
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,760
By the way...

86
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,550
Y-Yes?

87
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,260
Earlier, there was a report of an intruder.

88
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,520
Yes, it seems so.

89
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,850
But Impel Down is truly iron-tight.

90
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,060
Now that we have Warden Magellan in command,

91
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,570
I assume that it'll be over soon.

92
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,860
That's good.

93
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,860
Why would you want to sneak into hell?

94
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,320
That guy must be crazy.

95
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,210
Magellan has a deadly power.

96
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,580
Don't get caught, Luffy!

97
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,550
What's Saldeath doing?

98
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,050
The Blugoris can't beat
Straw Hat and Mr. 2 so...

99
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,470
...he went to level 2 to break up the riot.

100
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,910
Why was there no report before
things got this out of hand?!

101
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,280
You weren't paying attention because
you were crazy about Hancock-dono.

102
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,320
I didn't pay attention?

103
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,290
No, you didn't. As Warden, you
need to take responsibility.

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,080
Warden!

105
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,590
Can I see the prisoner now?

106
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,090
Okay, let's go! I'm ready to go!

107
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,970
W-Warden! Don't you realize
how serious this is?!

108
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,970
You're stupid.

109
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,810
If only you had checked on it at the time...

110
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,980
Warden! Stop sighing!

111
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,520
I didn't pay attention?!

112
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,570
Or - maybe you did pay attention!

113
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,530
Have the guests left, Warden?

114
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,290
Oh, Sadie-chan!

115
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,790
Salute the commander!

116
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,670
We're ready to go hunting...

117
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,630
What do you say?

118
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,140
You're just the person! Do
you have somebody on level 3?

119
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,770
Minotaurus... happens to be there!

120
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,330
That's good but there are many
places to hide on level 3.

121
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,830
It's hard to corner them.

122
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,960
Let's leave the riot to Saldeath and...

123
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,340
...summon all the other forces
of Impel Down to level 4!

124
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,840
Roger that!

125
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,680
If they manage to escape from Minotaurus
and come down here to the Burning Heat Hell,

126
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,930
I'll execute them with my own hands!

127
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,310
This great prison Impel Down
is not to be trifled with!

128
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,270
It's hot!

129
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,870
The air is so hot up here.

130
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,990
It's unbelievably hot!

131
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,410
We have no choice.

132
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,750
This is the safest place to be.

133
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,500
But we gotta figure out how to get to level 1

134
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,590
because we don't have much time!

135
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,220
Oh... I'm totally out of spit!

136
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,140
Are we gonna die like this?

137
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,530
What happened here?

138
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,700
I don't see any of the guards
who were here a while ago.

139
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,420
It's so quiet. Maybe we're dead already.

140
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,960
I have a bad feeling about this!

141
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,660
S-Straw-chan! This is not good!

142
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,610
What's this creature?!

143
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,610
I've never seen moves like those before!

144
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,290
It's Minotaurus!

145
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,250
Minotaurus?!

146
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,130
A cold-blooded demon guard!

147
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,130
A monster that tosses people
around like garbage!

148
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,720
That's who it is!

149
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,140
DEMON GUARD - MINOTAURUS

150
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,190
A monster?! A Devil Fruit eater?!

151
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,860
How do I know?!

152
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,280
Bon-chan!

153
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,840
Ouch!

154
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,000
What speed!

155
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,140
Straw-chan, watch out!

156
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,640
Wait just a Fouetté!

157
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,030
I-I can't breathe!

158
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,370
Second Gear!

159
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,230
Gum-Gum...

160
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,520
...Jet...

161
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,090
...Bazooka!

162
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,730
You alright, Bon-chan?

163
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,900
I almost died!

164
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,400
I saw the great heavenly
garden of Oh Come My Way!

165
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,090
You're very strong, indeed!

166
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,540
I'm sure that the monster's still alive
but I think he must be pretty hurt. Oh?

167
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,420
Oh no no! Fume, fume, fume!
My make-up's been ruined!

168
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,550
Cosmetics, cosmetics! I need some cosmetics!

169
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,180
Plus, pointe shoes and
clothes and weapons and...

170
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,180
...drinks and tears and Oh Come My Way!

171
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,980
I wanna get going now!
I'm thirsty and hungry!

172
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,770
Don't rush, Straw-chan!

173
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,360
It's too-too easy to go down
to level 4 from here, actually!

174
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,190
Oh, really?!

175
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,870
Yes! It's too-too easy! Much too-too!

176
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,840
--There it is, Straw-chan!
--Heh?

177
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,910
Climb this big wall!

178
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,830
All the way to the top?

179
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,500
Yes! But don't just barge
in! Watch your step!

180
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,800
Alright!

181
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,160
Ow, ow, ow, ouch!

182
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,120
What the hell?! It's hot
like a heated iron pot!

183
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,490
A heated iron pot?

184
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,850
It's something like that,
Straw-chan! Your hand alright?

185
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,120
Here we go!

186
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,160
Ouch!

187
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,280
Ow, ow, ow... Ouch!

188
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,910
Here, Straw-chan! You should
take a look at this!

189
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,820
There's a huge amount of hot air and smoke!

190
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,870
It's hard to even stand here!

191
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,050
Right! But...

192
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,600
...this is level 4 - the Burning
Heat Hell where you wanna go!

193
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,100
Burning Heat? Is it down there?

194
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,110
Yes! As you mentioned before, level
4 is exactly like a giant iron pot!

195
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,070
Once you go down there,

196
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,120
you'll see a boiling pool of blood
and the blazing sea of fire!

197
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,580
The heat on this level is
nothing compared to down there!

198
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,830
We can just jump down from here...

199
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,630
...but if you land on the
wrong spot, you'll be fried.

200
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,550
You're gonna have to risk your life
just to go further from now on!

201
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,980
Bon-chan!

202
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,240
You said that there's
someone that you wanna see.

203
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,660
Who is it that you wanna see
at the risk of your life?

204
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,450
People call him a miracle.

205
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,580
He was imprisoned on a baseless
charge. He's known as Ivan-san!

206
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,960
He's the queen of Kamabakka Kingdom,
the pink paradise of the Grand Line!

207
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,260
Every queer looks up to this world's
greatest queen of all queers!

208
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,800
The queen of all queers?!

209
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,600
There's a queen for queers?! Wow!

210
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,270
Yes, there is!

211
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,020
I wanna see him even just for a
little bit and rescue him if I can!

212
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,250
Hey! What're you, nuts?! Why're
you bringing him back again?!

213
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,130
You said you were gonna break out!

214
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,920
Straw Hat!

215
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,220
I knew you'd want to come with me!

216
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,810
No one wants to follow you to hell!

217
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,140
He smashed into us while we were hiding!

218
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,110
I dunno why!

219
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,860
--Oh, I knocked him your way.
--Oh, okay... No, it's not okay!

220
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,650
I don't wanna run anymore!

221
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,540
I should've...

222
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,240
I should've let myself
get caught rather than run away!

223
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,200
Stupid monster!

224
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,580
Minotaurus! I'm gonna die!

225
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,250
That leaves me one choice!

226
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,840
Hey, Straw Hat!

227
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,010
Do you remember the Buggy Ball?!

228
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,510
The powerful and special weapon that
I used to make you scared as hell?!

229
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,470
No.

230
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,890
You don't? You can't be serious...

231
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,310
I'm sure that you remember the Buggy Ball!

232
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,290
You were there when I blew up the
whole town with just one shot!

233
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,060
Ka-boom! Remember the ka-boom?!

234
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,070
I think it's hard to forget
something that was so shocking!

235
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,330
No.

236
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,650
Um... Well...

237
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,110
I mean...

238
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,220
There is this big and powerful
cannonball called Buggy Ball...

239
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,760
It's kinda like my special weapon...

240
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
Buggy Ball?!

241
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,940
I assume that you have a lot of confidence
in it because you put your name on it!

242
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,440
Yes, I have!

243
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,820
And I made it smaller without reducing
its power so I can carry it around!

244
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,280
--It's called Muggy Ball!
--You changed the name!

245
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,720
Anyway, you take this! The
special weapon - Muggy Ball!

246
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,040
Wow! Cool!

247
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,470
You did it!

248
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,510
It was a piece of cake!

249
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,480
Now, you remember it, Straw Hat?!

250
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,620
Damn! He's still alive!

251
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,460
We can beat him, Straw-chan!

252
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,330
Hey, 3! You sure that you can't
use your Wax-Wax powers?!

253
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,440
--It'll melt in 3 seconds!
--That means you can use it!

254
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,010
Fly, fly, I'm flying! "Oh
Come My Way" Kenpo...

255
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,180
...Memoirs of a Winter's Sky!

256
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,190
Ready, Straw Hat?!

257
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,360
--Candle Lock!
--Alright!

258
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,570
Gum-Gum...

259
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,070
...Mallet Rifle!

260
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,400
We did it!

261
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,700
We beat the monster of hell!

262
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,450
Alright, let's keep it
up and go on to level 4!

263
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,330
This is level 4.

264
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,480
All of our forces are rallied
under Warden Magellan!

265
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,410
Stay away!

266
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,920
Luffy!

267
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,740
Buggy and the others want to escape,
while Luffy wants to proceed to level 4.

268
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,840
In a stroke of good (or bad) luck, an
accident drops all of them into level 4.

269
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,910
But waiting for them there is
Warden Magellan, who has amassed

270
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,430
all the forces in Impel
Down together to stop them!

271
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

272
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,200
"All Forces Have Gathered! The Battle
on Level 4 The Burning Heat Hell!"

273
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
