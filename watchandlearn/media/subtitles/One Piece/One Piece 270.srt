00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,950
"Tower of Law"

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,320
In the Tower of Law,

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,870
Robin realized that Luffy and
the others had come to rescue her.

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,060
Wait! That's not what we agreed upon!

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,690
In return for my cooperation, you were
supposed to let them escape safely!

7
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,330
They came here after leaving
Water Seven safely, right?

8
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,840
They're hopeless scum. They don't
have a shred of morality in them.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,260
Huh? What'd you say?

10
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,010
Shut up, you trash!

11
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,060
To start with, we don't even have to
keep our promises with you criminals!

12
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,600
Take this! Take this! You bastard!

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,100
You too!

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,900
Don't get so cocky, you bitch!

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,450
You dirty coward...

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,080
The receiver is off.

17
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,170
We'll take Cutty Flam to Impel Down
and Nico Robin to Navy Headquarters.

18
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,250
As soon as the escort ship is ready,

19
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,930
we'll go through the
Gates of Justice and sail off.

20
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,470
You guys go back to your rooms
and take it easy for the time being.

21
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,730
What dependable guys my subordinates are.

22
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,610
As long as I have them, I feel like I can't lose!

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,330
Meanwhile, urging the King Bull
on in pursuit of Luffy,

24
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,460
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

25
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,460
the Straw Hats were moving
forward without a hitch, however...

26
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,210
Don't get on without permission!

27
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,400
Things are going smoothly! Good thing
we've got you guys on our side!

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,880
We're counting on you to
get us to Luffy, King Bulls!

29
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,120
He's asking, "By the way, was it
okay that the guy with the mask

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,310
didn't get on with you guys?"

31
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,370
--What?!
--Hm?

32
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,900
--What?
--Hm...?

33
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,450
What?! I-I can't find Sogeking anywhere!

34
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,990
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

35
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,950
L-Lieutenant Commander!

36
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,030
There's trouble!

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,030
What's the matter?!

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,870
Straw Hat Luffy...!

39
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,290
We lost Straw Hat Luffy!

40
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,040
Find him! Find Straw Hat at any cost!

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,180
As for Luffy, he finally reached
the rooftop of the courthouse.

42
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,890
That must be the last building.

43
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,480
All right.

44
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,020
What the heck?

45
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,610
Air Door.

46
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,500
Ah! You're that bull guy
who was with the pigeon guy!

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,340
I did think that there was no way
there'd be only five casualties.

48
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,800
Boy, that was a big surprise!

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,860
Since the start of the World
Government, it's unprecedented...

50
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,260
...for a man to step this far
into the Government's entrance.

51
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,570
How long are you planning to keep fighting?

52
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,070
Until I die.

53
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,960
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

54
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,850
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

55
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,860
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

56
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,740
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

57
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,450
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

58
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,420
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

59
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,790
we will be able to make it through

60
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,800
Always!

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,640
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,810
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

63
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,680
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

64
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,230
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

65
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,600
We can't stop here

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,570
Around the world

67
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,740
Start me up!

68
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,660
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

69
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,630
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

70
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,590
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

71
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,700
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

72
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,350
Brand New World

73
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,700
Start me up!

74
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,660
"Give Robin Back! Luffy vs. Blueno!"

75
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,210
Ahhh! Wh-Wh-What're we gonna do?!

76
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,930
In any case, we don't have the option
of going back to get him at this point.

77
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm sure he'll work things out on his own.

78
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,950
But there are guards everywhere on this island.

79
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,010
He isn't Luffy. If he's by
himself, his life will be...

80
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,050
After surmounting each island,
we got stronger without knowing.

81
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,970
He, too, always survived
life-or-death situations on each island.

82
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,470
No one in our group would die so easily.

83
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,460
"Always"? "In our group"?!
What're you talking about, Zoro?!

84
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:28,720
Sogeking came here to help us rescue
Robin because Usopp asked him to!

85
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,220
He is an invincible hero, right?

86
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,640
That's right!

87
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,190
Sogeking is a super hero
for justice. He'll definitely...

88
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,980
"Main Island Front Gate"

89
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,440
I failed to get on the King Bull...

90
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,080
What am I gonna do? I'm way behind now.

91
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,500
Battleship Cannon!

92
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,680
At any rate, those shipwrights are amazing!

93
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,600
In any case, I left the group. Shall I just run?

94
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,360
N-N-No! Running is the last thing I'll do!

95
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,070
I'm Usopp! I'm a man! I went so far
as to hide my identity to follow them!

96
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,990
We're facing a crisis where Robin is
sacrificing herself to protect all of us!

97
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,580
I have to do it at all costs!

98
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,660
All right... There's only
one way to get to everyone.

99
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,670
I'll carry out "Operation Disguise Myself
as One of the Government Personnel

100
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,090
and Pass by Them Unnoticed"!

101
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,720
Yeah, that'd be good.

102
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,220
Huh?!

103
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,890
Whoa! What?! What?!
Are they trying to drown me?!

104
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,520
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

105
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,310
How regrettable!

106
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,490
Ahhh! The giant woke up!

107
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,010
We screwed up in our 50th year!
I'm sorry, bosses!

108
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,860
Bosses?

109
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,080
We are a disgrace to Elbaf!

110
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,540
E-Elbaf?

111
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,160
Elbaf... Bosses...

112
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,550
Don't tell me...! I-Is it possible that
you're from Elbaf, that warriors' village?!

113
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,510
Who are you?!

114
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,720
I-I-I am Sogeking from the island of snipers.

115
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,630
Could you explain to me what
you're talking about in detail?

116
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,390
You're a total stranger from God knows where!

117
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,130
Why do I have to tell you?!

118
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,590
Calm down! Warriors from Elbaf
are the proudest men in the world!

119
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,790
And yet, you're crying a river here.
It must be a big deal.

120
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,160
So I want to know why.

121
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,200
Please...

122
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,160
There's no use in telling you about it, but...

123
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,620
Me and Kashii were pirates
up until 100 years ago

124
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,340
and we ran amok all over the world.

125
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,970
--What?
--But one day on some island...

126
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,770
Cheers!

127
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,600
Each one of 'em bagged an
insanely huge Sea King, after all!

128
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,080
Even though we're Elbaf giants,

129
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,170
nobody can take down those jumbo-sized
beasts except for our bosses!

130
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,740
Right, men?!

131
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,370
Those ones were definitely the biggest ones...

132
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,750
Yeah! The biggest ones we've ever caught!

133
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,210
So which one was bigger?

134
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
--Which...
--...one?

135
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,150
Mine is slightly bigger!

136
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,190
You wish! Mine's a whole
three centimeters bigger!

137
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,650
Say what?!

138
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,070
What's your problem?!

139
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,130
Bosses!

140
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,030
Please stop!

141
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,740
The two bosses started a duel.

142
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,310
It's a battle in which they put their
pride on the line. It can't be helped.

143
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,210
That's the signal for the duel.

144
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,800
The group was split up

145
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,630
and everyone ended up
going back to their hometown.

146
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,590
The central mountain... That's Little Garden...!

147
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,510
It was a life-or-death battle between warriors.

148
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,200
At the very least, the winner was
supposed to come back to the village,

149
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,900
but even after several decades,
neither of them came back.

150
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,050
After 50 years passed, me and Kashii
thought something was wrong,

151
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,570
so we set out to sea to go get those two.

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,060
But on our way, we got caught by the Navy
and they made us tell them everything.

153
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,040
Then, in return, we were told a shocking story.

154
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,700
They said that our bosses,
who were very strong,

155
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,750
were confined in the government's large prison!

156
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,320
--Huh?!
--That was about 50 years ago.

157
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,220
Hm?

158
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,030
The Government presented conditions.

159
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,090
If me and Kashii worked for
the Government for 100 years--

160
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,740
in other words, if we could protect this
gate in Enies Lobby for 100 years--

161
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,460
they'd release our bosses
and let us all go home to Elbaf.

162
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,970
Since a giant's life span is 300 years,
we thought 100 years was nothing.

163
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,340
So we accepted the conditions and
have kept fighting for the past 50 years.

164
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,470
But the gate was broken open today by pirates!

165
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,790
To think something like this happened...!

166
00:12:53,790 --> 00:13:00,460
Dammit! Our bosses will now be
imprisoned for the rest of their lives!

167
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,440
Hey, hey! H-H-Hold on a sec!

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,840
There's something funny about that story.

169
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,660
There's nothing funny about it!
If you're gonna laugh at our pride, then...

170
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,130
No, no, I didn't mean it that way!
I meant that it's weird!

171
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,640
Weird, you said?!

172
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,560
Because during our journey before
we came here, we met those two!

173
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,280
The two you're talking about,
the Elbaf warriors Dorry and Broggy,

174
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,200
have been fighting an evenly matched duel
on that island for the past 100 years!

175
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,360
What?! How come you know their names?!

176
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,530
What?! That can't be right!

177
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,210
If you wanna hear more proof,
I'll tell you as much as you want!

178
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,930
And...

179
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,900
You still don't believe me?! What do I
have to tell you to get you to believe me?!

180
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,700
About their weapons?!

181
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,040
Their techniques?!

182
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,420
73,466 duels...

183
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,300
I know everything!

184
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,590
73,466 draws...

185
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:33,300
We really met them!

186
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,250
You fought desperately to protect our pride.

187
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,420
As such, no matter what
manner of enemy there may be...

188
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,460
...we will not let them
destroy your pride, friends!

189
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,880
Have faith in us, and continue straight ahead!

190
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,930
Let's meet again someday.

191
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,770
Without fail.

192
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,300
Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

193
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,980
We've already been eaten!

194
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,690
Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

195
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,160
Hakoku Sovereignty!

196
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,840
We're flying out of it!

197
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,380
They cut... the very sea itself...

198
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,800
This is the strength of Elbaf warriors!

199
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,520
Now go!

200
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,030
I swore to myself to look
up to them as my masters

201
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,290
and become a man of great
pride like them some day!

202
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,320
And yet, you don't believe me?!

203
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,580
It's a big fat lie that they
got caught 50 years ago!

204
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,850
Our bosses are alive...

205
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,890
Yep, yep...

206
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,890
I see... I'm relieved... I'm so relieved.

207
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,570
"Main Island Front Gate"

208
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,820
"Courthouse"

209
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,000
Look! We're almost to the courthouse!

210
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,010
Bring them down without fail!

211
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,760
Crap! King Bull!

212
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,730
All right! We brought down one of them!

213
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,370
Sodom!

214
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,890
Sodom!

215
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,740
This is bad! I have to treat him right away!

216
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,530
Sodom! Stand firm! Don't fall yet!

217
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,540
Guys! Move over right away! Hurry it up!

218
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,750
Sodom can't go on much longer!

219
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,450
His pectoral muscle got hurt by a trench mortar!

220
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,410
Move over now before he falls!

221
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,630
No one's gonna be saved
unless you guys move forward!

222
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,690
He said, "Go!"

223
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,410
It's coming down!

224
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,810
No one's riding it!

225
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,350
What?!

226
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,230
Hey...

227
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,860
Let's go, Gomorrah!

228
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,230
So Robin is in that building behind you, huh?

229
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,160
Get out of my way, bull guy!

230
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,150
It seems that you guys haven't noticed...

231
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,000
...that what you're doing is a world-class crime.

232
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,030
Hm?

233
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,520
Just get to the point already.

234
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,610
The World Government is a
huge, powerful organization

235
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,860
that counts more than 170 countries
around the world as its members.

236
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,370
Invading this island,
which is under its possession,

237
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,450
is an act of revolt against all those countries!

238
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,830
Upon their dignity, the Government
will expose all of you to public ridicule

239
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,420
and bestow a merciless death upon you.

240
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,800
You guys are only a few dozen people.

241
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,380
That is nowhere near enough.

242
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,430
All I did was tell you to get out of my way.

243
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:13,030
My point is that you who entered the gates
of Enies Lobby already have no future,

244
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,110
whether I move out of
your way or not. That's all.

245
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,800
Fighting is a waste.

246
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,030
I thought you got a good taste of our
Six Powers at Galley-La's mansion...

247
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,280
...as well as the difference in
our levels of fighting ability.

248
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,790
Yeah, that's true...

249
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:36,920
But for some reason, I don't feel
like I'm gonna lose at all now!

250
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,510
Gum-Gum...

251
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,470
Iron Body.

252
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,680
...Rifle!

253
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,820
What?! I don't remember him
being as powerful as he is now

254
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,450
when I fought him at the mansion!

255
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,420
Gatling!

256
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,330
Shave!

257
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,440
The world this, the Government that...

258
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,530
It's not my problem.

259
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,000
We just came here to get Robin back!

260
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,170
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

261
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,090
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

262
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,220
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

263
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

264
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,480
We'll become No. 1

265
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,350
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

266
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,560
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

267
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,730
an era created by risking everything

268
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,860
We always try our best, let's go!

269
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,860
If we want to achieve glory,

270
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,240
now is the time--don't be afraid

271
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,160
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

272
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,120
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

273
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
We can take off with unknown powers

274
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,380
We don't fear, and we don't waver

275
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,090
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

276
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,130
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

277
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

278
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,350
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

279
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,350
Charge ahead

280
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,230
Let's start running towards tomorrow

281
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,230
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

282
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,450
Gomorrah!

283
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,300
This is bad. Enemies are gathering
from the front and the back.

284
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,420
This is terrible! There're thousands of enemies!

285
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,080
If we get surrounded in a place
like this, we can't move forward!

286
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,200
--What?!
--What's the matter, Chopper?!

287
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,090
Gomorrah... Gomorrah's saying something!

288
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,280
"Don't Stop! Hoist the Counterattack Signal!"

290
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,930
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
