00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,050
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,390
The feelings of those who are in anguish

21
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,800
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,220
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,430
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

24
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,260
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

25
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,040
As this was happening, at the southeast gate,

26
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,170
Usopp and Chopper were taking on

27
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,090
the mole-woman, Miss Merry Christmas,

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,420
and cleanup batter Mr. 4,
in a life-or-death battle.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,450
Calling on their wisdom, Usopp and
Chopper finally defeated the pair.

30
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,060
Meanwhile, Sanji and Mr. 2,
Bon Clay, were engaged

31
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,810
in hand-to-hand combat with each other.

32
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,060
Sanji faced impending danger
from the Copy-Copy Montage

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,940
put on by Mr. 2, Bon Clay.

34
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,860
H-How cute!

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,240
"Transformed into Nami!
Bon Clay's Rapid-Fire Ballet Kenpo"

36
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,640
You're just what they mean when
they say, "he's nothing but talk!"

37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,720
You don't even have the
strength left to get up, do you?

38
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,990
Don't think I'm just going to
lie down and be beaten like this!

39
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,560
No matter how much you
might look like Nami-san,

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,610
you're still that idiot on the inside.

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,360
You damn bastard! Don't get too cocky--

42
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,240
Damn it! She's so cute!

43
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,260
Aah, I must say,
this country is too hot for me.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,230
I just want to take all of my clothes off.

45
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,320
I'll help!

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,080
Ballet Chop!!

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,800
My eyes!

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,050
You fool!

49
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,770
Kick Pointe!!

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,810
You're nothing but talk, are you?!

51
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,690
You bastard...!

52
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,190
Mess with me, will you?!

53
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,950
Mascara Boomerang!!

54
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,160
I'll see you in hell!

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,450
Oh, don't kick me.

56
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,970
Have to catch my mascara, okay?

57
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,180
Playing with you is fun, but I can't
dawdle around too long, you know?

58
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,510
It's my duty to kill the princess, after all.

59
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm going to hurry up and finish this now.

60
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,730
Ha! Twirl, twirl, I'm twirling around!

61
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,200
What?! Blow up the royal palace?!

62
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,290
Yeah. Orders have come down
to blow up the royal palace.

63
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,780
We're going to blow up the royal palace!

64
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,190
They can't be serious.

65
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,700
The palace has a 4,000-year history.

66
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,780
What can I say...

67
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,840
...about this situation we are in?

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,320
It's okay, I understand.
There was nothing you could do,

69
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,850
except to intercept the rebel army.

70
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,840
Igaram aside, you've done well
in suppressing the uprising

71
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,920
for over two years. But I was not wrong.

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,820
I met some true friends,
who are going to save Alabasta.

73
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,460
You guys go on ahead!
I can handle this myself!

74
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,090
Make sure you deliver Vivi back
to her home! Make sure, now!

75
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,670
Listen to me, Vivi. He will
keep Crocodile under control.

76
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,680
The moment that the
rebel army started running,

77
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,840
the time limit on this land was set.

78
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,100
Once the royal army
and the rebel army meet,

79
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,810
this land will be gone.

80
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,570
If you are the one and only
hope for preventing that,

81
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,060
then you have to survive, no matter what.

82
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,640
No matter what might happen
to any of us here, from now on!

83
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,380
All of you, who are willing
even to give your lives,

84
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,680
how are you faring now?

85
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,570
Vivi-sama...

86
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Over the two years that
I have not seen you,

87
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,610
you have become quite beautiful.

88
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,250
Once we have seen this war through,

89
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,840
I would sure like to hold a
grand banquet for those pirates.

90
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,640
Chaka...

91
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,140
Gimme food.

92
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,780
After I kick Crocodile's ass,
gimme so much food I might die!

93
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,140
Yes. I believe in you.
Luffy-san, you are all right.

94
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,490
I'm sure that you must
have defeated Crocodile.

95
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,950
Chaka-sama!

96
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,950
What is it?

97
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,570
Is it true that you are going
to blow up the royal castle?!

98
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,720
The soldiers are getting explosives ready!

99
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,290
There must be some mistake!

100
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,250
I am the one who gave the order.

101
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,590
Vivi-sama!

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,010
Please use as much explosive as there is.

103
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,240
In order to stop the senseless fighting,

104
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,060
and to save the lives
of the people of Alabasta,

105
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,700
we will blow up the royal palace!

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
Hang in there!
This is nothing serious, Usopp!

107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,600
You just shattered your femur, that's all!

108
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,240
You may have busted your nose,
your humeri, and your clavicles,

109
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,280
but you lost only a little more
blood than should be fatal.

110
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,340
Your blood pressure
may be at zombie-grade,

111
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,870
but there's nothing to worry about!

112
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,380
Right now, I feel fantastic...

113
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,280
I see pretty fields of flowers...

114
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,240
You don't mean heaven, do you?!
Can you see heaven?!

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,300
No matter how great a pirate you may be,

116
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,600
the end will still come for you...

117
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,140
D-Don't die, Usopp!
Please, I don't want you to die!

118
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,620
Farewell, Chopper...
I leave my vast treasure to you...

119
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,070
15 gold and silver coins...
Become a good doctor...

120
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,610
Usopp!

121
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,330
Open your eyes! There's something
I have to apologize to you for!

122
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,750
This manju bun...

123
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,380
This is the manju bun that
you wanted, and I hid it.

124
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,030
If I knew you were going to die,
I would have given you half.

125
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,390
I've been a small, narrow-minded man.

126
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,060
Manju bun?!

127
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,460
Manju bun...

128
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,770
Confound that idiot!
Where the hell did she go?

129
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,860
This is why I told her to
pipe down and hide somewhere.

130
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,320
She does nothing but slow
me down. Dumb woman!

131
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,660
That's it, I can't run anymore!
I'll have to fight!

132
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,900
Impossible!

133
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,760
We're getting nowhere.

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,680
He's so impatient.

135
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,140
Zoro!

136
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,690
The stone column! It split up lengthwise!

137
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:03,080
Split? No, it didn't.
It was clearly a swordsman.

138
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Out of my way.

139
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,820
You cut it, didn't you? With those arms?

140
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,380
That's quite an unusual body
you've got there, isn't it?

141
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,350
Indeed it is. I ate the Dice-Dice Fruit,
making blades of my entire body.

142
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,310
You're him, aren't you?

143
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,650
The swordsman who is said to have
cut down 100 men at Whisky Peak?

144
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,040
Also, the pirate who, several years ago,

145
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,890
turned down an invitation to
Baroque Works at East Blue,

146
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,660
and cut down the Mr. 7 at the time...

147
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,490
...is you, isn't it?

148
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,000
Ha! There's a story that takes me back.

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,430
That was your fault,
for not accepting my terms.

150
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,530
I told your scout man back then this:

151
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,300
"I will join, if you make me your boss."

152
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,430
Such a funny man.

153
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,370
Far from meeting my terms,
he took a slash at me.

154
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,220
I just put him in his place.

155
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,140
Would you like to try inviting me, too?

156
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,340
Right now, you guys are so ridiculous,

157
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,880
I wouldn't even accept
the position as your boss.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,560
You're making quite the fool of me, huh?

159
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,830
You, a swordsman, from a
small-time band of pirates...

160
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,810
In that case, who do
you think you guys are?

161
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,620
Puppets, without volition of your own,

162
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,790
baited into creating a utopia in name only?

163
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,420
Or are you really just tin soldiers...

164
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,340
...without any substance?

165
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,720
Miss Doublefinger...

166
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,800
You're going to tell me you
want to eliminate him, right?

167
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,730
Do as you please. And I'll deal with the girl.

168
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,170
Hey, Nami!

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,480
She's gone!

170
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,080
Twirl, twirl! A finishing
320,000-spin grand fouetté!

171
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,830
Can it be...?

172
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,040
Ballet Kenpo!
Memoirs of a Summer's Day!!

173
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,440
I see your weakness.

174
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,050
I've seen through your Copy-Copy Fruit.

175
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,030
I've seen through your Copy-Copy Fruit.

176
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,650
--Memoirs of a Summer's Day!!
--Joue Shoot!!

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,330
Sure enough. No doubt about it.

178
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,770
You've seen through it,
you say? Through what?!

179
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,090
What part of my ability has
someone like you seen through?

180
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,340
You can't use your Ballet Kenpo
while in Nami-san's body, can you?

181
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,370
It's true, I might not be able to attack you,

182
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,070
but the moment you attack me,
you always return to normal.

183
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,520
By touching your cheek with your left hand.

184
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,280
Eh? What's that? I can't hear you at all!

185
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,160
Hey, I'm right, aren't I?

186
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,690
S-So what if you are?!

187
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,400
Yes, yes, without this limber
body that I've developed,

188
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,830
training daily in harsh,
demanding lessons,

189
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,440
I can't perform my Ballet Kenpo. So what?

190
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,430
You're still plenty
black and blue, aren't you?!

191
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,090
What's more, let me show you this.
The prima of Ballet Kenpo!

192
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,140
I'll just say this much about it.

193
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,900
From your viewpoint, the left one is
the pen, and the right one is the cob.

194
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,610
Who cares?

195
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,060
Whether you've seen through
it or not, it doesn't matter!

196
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,410
Take this! Ballet Kenpo...

197
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,490
...Bombardier!!

198
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,580
What?! That's the mark of his kick?!

199
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,550
The right choice!
Avoiding that was the right choice!

200
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,370
At the end of their bent
necks are steel beaks!

201
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,180
There isn't a single crack
around that hole!

202
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,810
True power,
when compressed into one point,

203
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,140
does not destroy anything needlessly.

204
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,200
Consider one of my kicks to
be like a shot from a rifle.

205
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,730
However, the bullet is
a bit on the large side.

206
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm going to perforate you!

207
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,610
Un!

208
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,740
Deux!

209
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,070
--Collier!!
--Krah!

210
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,980
That won't work!

211
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,980
Damn! Too much difference in our reaches!

212
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,090
This fight is over, huh?!

213
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,800
Flying, flying, I'm flying!

214
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,900
Ballet Kenpo! Memoirs of a Winter's Sky!!

215
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,340
But the longer his reach is,
the longer it takes to recover.

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,230
If I can avoid his shot,
I'll have that much more speed!

217
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,650
Die, now!

218
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,030
Too bad. How do you like this?

219
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,490
Hey, you've got something
stuck to your left cheek.

220
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,320
Really?

221
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,960
Basses Côte!!

222
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,960
Longe!!

223
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,250
Tendron!!

224
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,470
--Flanchet!!
--Un!

225
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,700
Deux!

226
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,140
--Ora!
--Quasi!!

227
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,080
--Tendron!! Quasi!! Collier!!
Flanchet!! Cuisseau!! Jarret!!
--Un! Deux! Ora!

228
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,820
--Tendron!! Quasi!! Collier!!
Flanchet!! Cuisseau!!
--Un! Deux! Krah! Un!

229
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,990
--Damn it!
--Deux!

230
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,190
--Collier!!
--Krah!

231
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,400
--Jarret!! Collier!! Quasi!!
Flanchet!! Gigot!! Selle!!
--Un! Deux! Ora!

232
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,520
--Queue!! Jarret!! Collier!! Quasi!!
--Un! Deux! Krah!

233
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,170
--Flanchet!! Gigot!! Selle!! Queue!!
--Un! Deux! Ora!

234
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,670
Un! Deux! Krah!

235
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,050
Un! Deux!

236
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,590
--Queue!!
--Krah!

237
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,560
--Veau Shot!!
--Bombardier Arabesque!!

238
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,130
I-I give...

239
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,520
You astound me. You're still alive?

240
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,230
What's the matter? If you turn
yourself into Nami-san again,

241
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,420
I can't finish you off.

242
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,560
Ridiculous... I can't move,
in the shape I'm in...

243
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,320
What good will it do to avoid
the outcome of this?

244
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,030
You've won. Kill me.

245
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,670
I'm destined to be eliminated
by the organization anyhow.

246
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,170
What are you waiting for?

247
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,610
Hurry up and strike the last blow...

248
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,470
That was a good fight. We shouldn't
need any more words than that.

249
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,720
This is, unmistakably, the testament
of friendship between rivals.

250
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,110
But I'm not going to cry...

251
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,270
Bye, now. I'll be taking back
our sharpshooter's goggles.

252
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,710
H-He did strike the last blow...

253
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,170
I've scuffed up another
couple of bones, there, huh?

254
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,140
"Alubarna - South Block"
"Battle of Polka Street"

255
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,170
"Alubarna - South Block"
"Battle of Polka Street"
"Winner: Sanji" "Prize: A little camaraderie"

256
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,230
E-Everything here is ready!

257
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,740
We can ignite here at any time, too!

258
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,430
This castle has taken in
Alabasta's history for 4,000 years.

259
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,260
It has been a source of pride for me.

260
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,570
But if we destroy the royal palace,

261
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,400
the people will stop fighting,
and pay attention.

262
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,980
I will be able to tell them
the truth in my own words!

263
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,280
Okay, light them!

264
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,450
Yes, ma'am!

265
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,290
W-What is this?!

266
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,970
Are you all right?!

267
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,980
I-It's him...!

268
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,480
We can't have that.

269
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,490
That was quite a treacherous thing
to do, wasn't it, Miss Wednesday?

270
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,490
This is soon to be my house.

271
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,330
Crocodile!

272
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
Your Majesty!

273
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,790
Father!

274
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,680
It sure is nice to have a palace, huh?

275
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,350
It's a fine place to look
down on the filth below.

276
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,810
W-Where is Luffy-san?

277
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,270
Huh? You mean Straw Hat? That puny rookie?

278
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,390
He's dead.

279
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,760
I always wanted to talk about it

280
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,310
I couldn't even say half of it

281
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:41,820
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

282
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:54,540
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

283
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,680
Glory glory you're my shine

284
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:06,480
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

285
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,200
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

286
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,700
I'm sure I'll make it there

287
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,710
I hope Nami got away all right.
She can't match up

288
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,180
to someone with those abilities.

289
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,160
Nami, it looks like it's finally
time for you to use it, huh?

290
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,590
I've found you, girl.

291
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,320
Your new weapon...

292
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,970
Usopp, stay with me!

293
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,390
Take this, Miss Doublefinger!

294
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

295
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,860
"Nami's Cyclone Advisory!
Clima Takt Burst"

296
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
