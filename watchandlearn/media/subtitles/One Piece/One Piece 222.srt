00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:13,980
"Now, Let's Get Back Our Memories!
The Pirate Crew Lands on the Island"

24
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,740
"Golden Pavilion"

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,240
There's no mistaking that this is my handwriting.

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,200
Sky islands... Navy base G8...

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,160
And this gold...

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,540
If this is all true, everything makes sense.

29
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,750
If I could go back to Cocoyashi Village,
I should be able to figure everything out!

30
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,090
But there aren't any decent ships.
How can I go back...?

31
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,300
And, of all the places, I'm in the Grand Line?

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,590
According to this sea chart,

33
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,810
you can't exit the Grand Line midway
through to get to the East Blue.

34
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,690
Wh-What'd you say?!

35
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,190
You're the captain, you say?!

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,900
At any rate, that was close.

37
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,820
If I hadn't remembered things, I would've
remained Usopp's underling forever.

38
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,700
Shut up! I'm never gonna believe it!

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,790
No matter what anyone says,
I am the great pirate, Captain Usopp,

40
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,370
who leads 8,000 underlings
in the Usopp Pirates!

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,420
That's the spirit! That's our Usopp!

42
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,420
But you're the sniper of
the Straw Hat Pirates, Usopp!

43
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,800
Shoot... Now he's above me.

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,680
This guy is a monster just like me,
and yet he's a captain?

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,470
Chopper!

46
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,390
Ahh! Don't come this way!

47
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,650
Are you still acting like that?

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,270
Let's play like we always do!

49
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,740
I'm the ship's doctor, and yet I was
really doing something like this?

50
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,110
Sure, this is your signature party piece.

51
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,450
You did it whenever we had a party.

52
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,620
A one! A two!

53
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,790
--A one, two, three!
--That rubber monkey said
that he regained his memories,

54
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,410
but he acts just like he did before.

55
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,790
It means that our captain doesn't change,
no matter what happens.

56
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,040
Hey, let's sing the usual song!

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Even if I'm part of a pirate crew, if I'm
nobody, they might just slave drive me.

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
On top of that, being around monsters like them,

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,260
no matter how many lives
you have, it won't be enough.

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,550
Now it's clear.

61
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,890
It's not that everyone lost their memories.
Their memories were taken away.

62
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,440
And the culprit, after all, is...

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,770
Who's that damn brat?

64
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,940
Yeah, what does he want with our memories?

65
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,730
Good question.

66
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,820
Ah! Shoot!

67
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,950
What?

68
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,660
I have to bring back Nami
and Zoro. Let's go, everyone!

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Huh?

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,910
Let's wait until morning.

71
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,830
Hm? Why, Robin?

72
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,080
We've never been to this place.
On top of that, it's the dead of night.

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,500
It won't be that easy to find them.

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,670
Hmm... I guess you're right.

75
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,590
Wouldn't it be better to
sleep a little until dawn?

76
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,930
That boy seems to have learned a lesson.

77
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,510
I don't think we have to worry
about him showing up again tonight.

78
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,270
Okay! We'll leave tomorrow morning then.

79
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,480
--Hold on.
--Hm?

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,860
I'm all for bringing back that lady, Nami-san,

81
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,690
but I don't see why we're
going after that Zoro guy.

82
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,870
Me neither! If you wanna go,
you two can go by yourselves!

83
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,530
I-I...

84
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,950
What're you guys saying?!

85
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,370
We're saying, why do we have to include Zoro?

86
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,870
He's a pirate hunter, you know!

87
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,540
Why do we have to go to the
trouble of chasing after him?

88
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,010
Why else? It's because he's one of us!

89
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,260
Even if you say he's one of us... Right...?

90
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,890
He doesn't feel that way even a bit.
You know that, too, don't you?

91
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,980
The fact that he left in a hurry is proof of that.

92
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,980
Usopp is the sniper. Sanji is the cook.

93
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,730
Chopper is the ship doctor.
Robin is the archaeologist.

94
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,860
Nami is the navigator.
And Zoro is the swordsman.

95
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,320
We, the Straw Hat Pirates, can't leave
anyone out, not even one person!

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,790
We just have to get the
swordsman's memories back.

97
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,960
If so, then I just have to beat up that brat,
just like I did earlier, right?

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,250
Right, Chopper?

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,710
Well, looks like we'll have a busy day tomorrow.

100
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,970
Let's get some sleep while we can!

101
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,310
The key to solving all the
mysteries is on that island...

102
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,730
I underestimated Monkey D. Luffy.

103
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,690
If I make an enemy out of him,
I could be in big trouble.

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,200
But I'll definitely make my wish come true.

105
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,080
In order to do so, I have to make friends, too.

106
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,420
And you can't go wrong
with a skilled swordsman.

107
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,850
That's right. It's different from yesterday.

108
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,940
This is Zoro, a pirate hunter.

109
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,150
If I carelessly get closer,
I may make another blunder.

110
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,030
Okay. I won't do it now.
There'll be another chance, anyway.

111
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,160
Yeah, when that time comes,
I'll have you do your job but good.

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,340
It's said that the All Blue has
foodstuffs from around the world.

113
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,050
I used to dream of going to that legendary sea.

114
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,510
I didn't ask for your help!

115
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,930
I can't think of any reason
for you to be kind to me!

116
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,930
Why...? Why did you?!

117
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,100
Because you had the same dream as me.

118
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,310
Restaurant?

119
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,900
Yeah. I was thinking that I'd build a
restaurant as my final purpose in life...

120
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,570
All right, then, I'll help
you do that. So don't die!

121
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,330
Ha! It's impossible for a
weak little brat like you!

122
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,710
I'll become strong, too!

123
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,710
There's no way that I'd leave that
damn annoying geezer, my benefactor.

124
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,300
Why...? What happened to me?

125
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,600
Pepper, Carrot, Onion... I wonder what
the Usopp Pirates are doing now...

126
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,650
Alright! Let's go, Usopp Pirates!
To protect this village's peace!

127
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,030
So what adventure are
you going to tell me today?

128
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,370
Hmm, let's see...

129
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,740
The story of when I fought the giant
goldfish at the South Pole when I was five!

130
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,200
Goldfish?

131
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,460
Yeah! What first shocked me
was the immense size of its poop!

132
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,710
It was so big that I landed on it,
thinking it was solid ground!

133
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,390
I had a dream that I wanted to
become a pirate like my old man.

134
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,560
But to think that I became a pirate
when I had to leave them to do so...

135
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,650
Why am I with humans?

136
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,150
The only ones I trusted were
Dr. Hiriluk and Doctorine.

137
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,820
Even among the reindeers, I had
no friends. I was always alone.

138
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,160
I will never shoot you!

139
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,370
My name is Dr. Hiriluk!

140
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,710
I'm a doctor!

141
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,790
In other words, there's no disease
in this world that can't be cured.

142
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,970
No matter what anyone says about me,
I'll save this country as a doctor!

143
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,510
That's why I raised this skull
towards all the diseases!

144
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,100
Skull...

145
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,640
That's right! This is a symbol of
the belief that nothing is impossible!

146
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,320
By raising this, I'll fight just like pirates do!

147
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,320
My friends? On top of that, six of them?

148
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,530
I can't believe that I'm the
ship's doctor for a pirate ship!

149
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,990
But what if it's true...

150
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,670
They won't.

151
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,090
My dream won't be lost. It must
be the same for you guys, too.

152
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,790
Nami, Zoro, just wait. I'm coming for you now!

153
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,250
Everyone! Wake up!

154
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,040
We've been up for a while now.

155
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,460
The cook and the ship's doctor
said that they're coming along.

156
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,420
Hm?

157
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,800
We can't just abandon that lady.

158
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,430
Also, Robin-san needs a bodyguard, too, so...

159
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,810
If someone gets injured, you'll be in
trouble without me, a doctor, right?

160
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,980
So I'm taking on the job of guarding the ship!

161
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,110
--Come along with us too, Usopp!
--Like I said...

162
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,820
Well, actually, I've got "My Heart Will
Stop Once on the Island" disease.

163
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,740
--Ow, ow, ow...
--Just come with us.

164
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,620
I know that Usopp, a brave warrior
of the sea, has his moments.

165
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,490
Well, I guess.

166
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,870
All right! We'll all go!

167
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,870
Shoot! I just got too elated...

168
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,250
So, how are we gonna get to the island?

169
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,250
How about using a raft?

170
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,800
Oh, that's a good idea.
We're counting on you, Usopp!

171
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,930
Why me?! I'm Captain Usopp!

172
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,430
Yeah, yeah...

173
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,890
At the very least, I'm a sniper!

174
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,390
Either way, there's no way I could
do stuff like a shipwright would do.

175
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,440
To make a raft, all you have to do
is to put logs together, right?

176
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,360
That's easy!

177
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,400
Are those knots done right?

178
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,610
Well, that's pretty much it.

179
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,320
Hey, hey... Knots like that will untie
right away and the logs will drift apart.

180
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
If we're gonna make one,
I want a cool-looking one.

181
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,750
How about this?!

182
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,920
No! This one is cooler!

183
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,250
According to my tastes, it should be this!

184
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,300
Hey!

185
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,340
You guys call yourselves pirates when
you can't even make a decent raft?!

186
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,590
Whoa...

187
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,390
What amazing workmanship!

188
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,970
Usopp has his moments!

189
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,020
I admit, I have no idea myself why I built it...

190
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,730
All right! We're off!

191
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,200
Thanks for letting me stay.
How much do I owe you?

192
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,990
Hm? Who are you?

193
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,580
What? I'm your inn guest
who stayed here last night.

194
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,160
Do you know her?

195
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,830
No, I don't know her.

196
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,840
Is it possible that she's a thief?

197
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,500
Wh-What?!

198
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,170
Hold on a sec! I'm your guest!

199
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:12,520
"Inn" "Inn"

200
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,130
I met all three of you yesterday, right?

201
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,350
You guys really don't remember me? Manager?

202
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,520
Manager? Me?

203
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,690
He's the manager, right?

204
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,810
Oh, is he?

205
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm lucky that I got a free stay out of it,
but what on earth is going on?

206
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,070
Could this be...

207
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,540
Who are you?

208
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,910
You guys lost your memories, too?

209
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,790
I was like that...

210
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,340
...yesterday...!

211
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,000
About yesterday?

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,720
Yeah. I think they came to this village.

213
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,510
A moss-head swordsman and a woman
on a strange vehicle. Did you see them?

214
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,850
Yesterday... what did I do?

215
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,640
You too?! Seriously, what the heck
is with the people on this island?!

216
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,900
To think no one even
remembers about yesterday!

217
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,190
What carefree people!

218
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,150
Is it an issue of being carefree?

219
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,150
We can't complain about them.

220
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,700
--What?
--We, too, can't...

221
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,240
The cause might be the same.

222
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,910
What're we gonna do? It'll be kinda
tough finding them in this situation.

223
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,120
Okay, then. Let's go back to the ship.

224
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,880
Staying on this creepy island won't
do us any good. Right? Let's go back.

225
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,220
Nami!

226
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,050
Oh, shoot!

227
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,680
Wait up.

228
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,900
This is terrible...

229
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,400
Why did you run away, Nami?

230
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,820
I'll never give this to you!

231
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,700
Even if you kill me, I won't give this to you!

232
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,450
Don't say that! There's no way
we'd hurt a pretty lady like you!

233
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,080
We won't even lay a finger on you!

234
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,910
Though I want to, to be honest...

235
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,460
What kind of disease does he have?
Do something about it, doctor.

236
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,710
It's definitely a serious condition,
but I'm also sure that there's no cure for it.

237
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,380
Then, let's make a deal.

238
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,840
A deal?

239
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,300
I'll give you 10% of this treasure.

240
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,800
So take me to Cocoyashi Village using that ship!

241
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,180
--No.
--Then, how about 20%?

242
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,480
--No.
--Then, 30%!

243
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,270
--No.
--Pretending that there's no tomorrow, 50%!

244
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,230
No.

245
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,610
Just how much do you want to rip me off for?!

246
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,280
You love treasure.

247
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,410
There's no way you're thinking
of sharing any of it with us.

248
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,240
How can you tell what I'm thinking?!

249
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,540
Because we're friends, of course!

250
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,540
Me, friends with you guys?! Give me a break!

251
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,010
There's no way we're friends!
The negotiations broke down. See ya!

252
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,680
Please move.

253
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,010
I won't. Nami, you come along with us, too.

254
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,940
No way! Why would I go with you guys?!

255
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,980
Please move!

256
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,480
I won't.

257
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,020
Navigator.

258
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,570
You've been feeling something's odd too,
since you came to this island.

259
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,360
Am I wrong?

260
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,120
What's the matter, lady?

261
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,830
A child with a strange horn...

262
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,380
I kicked his ass. And then,
smoke came out from the horn.

263
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,010
When I thought it went into my body...

264
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,550
The captain's memories came back.

265
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,060
No way. Wasn't it a dream or something?

266
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,060
It's true. I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

267
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,270
That damn brat... I feel like I saw
him the night before last, too.

268
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,360
Why did he come twice?

269
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,650
Maybe because he couldn't steal
all your memories in one shot.

270
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,240
Even with just what I know,

271
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,240
you guys have experienced an
incredible number of adventures.

272
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,540
He couldn't eat them all in one shot, so he
returned yesterday on an empty stomach?

273
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,620
I think that's what happened.

274
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,250
Oh? I wonder if memories taste good.

275
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Then that kid is...

276
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,630
See you later!

277
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,470
All right, then! Let's kick that kid's ass again

278
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,800
and get everyone's memories back!

279
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,770
If we do that, Zoro will
probably come back, too.

280
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,640
I'm doubtful whether it'd go that smoothly,

281
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,480
but we have to get even with that damn brat.

282
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,980
Why don't we forget about Zoro?!

283
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,480
Even if we regain our
memories by some chance,

284
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,990
it's kinda unsettling to be on
the same ship as a pirate hunter.

285
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,280
Zoro is the swordsman. Nami is the navigator.

286
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,990
Both of them are our friends that we need.

287
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,000
Even if you say so, I'm in a bind!

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,500
To think that I'm one of you...

289
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,460
I'm the one who'll be in
a bigger bind without you.

290
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,380
Without a navigator,
the ship can't go anywhere!

291
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,130
Robin, can you tell where that kid is?

292
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,640
Well... there's a place that I want to check out.

293
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,060
Okay then! Let's go!

294
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,770
H-Hey! My gold is...!

295
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,060
I won't let a lady carry stuff!

296
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,480
If I can be with you, Nami-san,
this is no trouble at all!

297
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,150
Ahh... I have a bad feeling about this.

298
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,240
No matter what they say, they all follow Luffy.

299
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,240
I wonder if it's true that I now have friends...

300
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,330
What're you doing?! Hurry up, Chopper!

301
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,910
Okay!

302
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,200
If you wanna eat, help yourself.

303
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,120
It's true that I am hungry,

304
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,080
but I don't eat this kind of stuff.

305
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
I see.

306
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,370
Why aren't you asking who I am?

307
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,540
Oh, yeah... People on this island
don't even remember their own names.

308
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,050
You thought it was no use asking, huh?

309
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,050
You set out on a journey to become
the world's strongest, right, mister?

310
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:28,430
Then, to you, Monkey D. Luffy is
the perfect opponent, you know.

311
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,560
I'm Luffy! Nice to meet you!

312
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,900
That straw hat guy?

313
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,860
I'm surprised that Roronoa Zoro
couldn't perceive his strength.

314
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,700
I couldn't perceive it?

315
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,160
That's right. In the East Blue,

316
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,620
he destroyed the vicious fishman
pirate group, Arlong Pirates.

317
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,290
Here in the Grand Line,
he brought down Crocodile,

318
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,830
one of the Seven Great Pirates, all by himself.

319
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,250
Seven Great Pirates?

320
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,000
That's not all.

321
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,510
On the sky islands, he even
beat up the god named Eneru.

322
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,340
Oh, yeah... He went on a
rampage in a Navy base, too!

323
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,180
Against Luffy, even the
Navy throws up its hands.

324
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,100
I've never seen a pirate like that before!

325
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,850
Don't talk nonsense!

326
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,940
I don't have time to listen to lies like that.

327
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,900
Hey, now you want to fight Luffy, don't you?

328
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,290
You jerk! What on earth...

329
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,640
Hm? What's this place?

330
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,310
Is that weird brat here? This is kinda creepy.

331
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,570
I-I wonder if I caught a cold or something.

332
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,070
I've been feeling a chill for a while.

333
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,490
I wish we had a doctor at a time like this.

334
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,240
That's me!

335
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,330
I bet these people are trying to take me
to a deserted place and steal the gold!

336
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,840
I won't let that happen!

337
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,630
Nami-san has been giving me
passionate eyes all this time!

338
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,010
There's no doubt! She fell in love with me!

339
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,970
--Wink!
--Wh-What?!

340
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,230
Is that a sign that he's gonna steal
the gold?! What a creepy guy!

341
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,520
I see...

342
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,480
Ah, a butterfly!

343
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,690
Did you find something out, Robin?

344
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,280
I figured out the culprit who
took your memories away...

345
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,240
No... I mean, the real culprit.

346
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,080
That damn brat isn't the culprit?

347
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,370
Now, let's head to the Sea God's Palace.

348
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,210
The Sea God's Palace?

349
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,380
What the heck is that?

350
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,130
I'm calling it that for now...

351
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

352
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

353
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

354
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

355
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

356
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

357
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

358
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

359
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

360
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

361
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

362
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

363
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

364
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

365
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

366
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

367
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,200
Eternally... Eternally...

368
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,550
Ahh, this really was a bad idea!

369
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,340
I feel it's pointless to go with you guys!

370
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,630
She's right. Hey, let's go back. Let's go back!

371
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,050
No. We're going to bring Zoro back.

372
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,930
That damn swordsman is coming this way.

373
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,430
Oh, you're right. Hey!

374
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,970
Wait. Something is odd.

375
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,770
Really? Zoro is always like this.

376
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,640
On the next episode of One Piece!

377
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,020
"Zoro Bares His Fangs!
A Savage Animal Stands in the Way!"

378
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,570
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
