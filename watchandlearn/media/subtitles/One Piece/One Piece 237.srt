2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,420
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,540
Do what you want with the Merry.

24
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,550
We'll get a new ship and
move on to the seas ahead!

25
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,640
Well then, bye, Usopp...

26
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,900
It's been fun.

27
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,830
Don't lose yourself.

28
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,670
If you waver, who can we trust?

29
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,460
Let's vacate the ship.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,260
We can't come back... to this ship, so...

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:47,450
"Severe Shock Hits the City
of Water! Iceberg Targeted!"

32
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,710
Who was the first to find him?
Please let us question them!

33
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,790
Who's the culprit?!

34
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,630
Are they connected with the
annihilation of Franky House?!

35
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,540
Please give us a statement!

36
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,380
Please tell us the latest developments!

37
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,630
Hey, did you hear about the incident
at the shipbuilding island?

38
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,470
Is it true that he died?

39
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,510
It must be Franky who did it!

40
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,520
This happened because they left him at large!

41
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,640
Well, there's also a strong chance it was
done by pirates who visit the shipyard.

42
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,980
In fact, I heard that there was an
explosion at the cape late last night.

43
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,940
Is that related to this incident?

44
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,780
I don't know, but there are many pirates
who got beaten up by the foremen, so...

45
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,840
So this is where you guys were...

46
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,310
We went to the trouble of getting a room
at this inn and yet no one's in there.

47
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,980
I guess you all couldn't sleep, huh?

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,650
Where's Luffy?

49
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,480
Over there.

50
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,620
Where'd you go, Sanji?

51
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,710
Hm... I kept a lookout at
the rocky cape all night,

52
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,580
thinking that Robin-chan might come back.

53
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,220
I wonder where she went...
without saying anything to us...

54
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,440
It's been nothing but trouble
since we got to this island.

55
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,150
We had our money stolen, and moreover,

56
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,230
look what happened with Usopp...

57
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,240
He's badly wounded.

58
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,280
I bet he's running a fever
by now and can't even move!

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,490
Chopper...

60
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,700
Stop talking about him.

61
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,800
I think I'm gonna wander around
town looking for her today.

62
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,050
I wonder if we can find her.

63
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,130
Who knows?

64
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,930
It's not like I have specific
places in mind to check,

65
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,680
but in any case, it's certain that
she's somewhere in this town.

66
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,060
Let's make this inn the place to
meet up if something happens.

67
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll go look for her, too.

68
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,820
Okay. Well, then...

69
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,280
Luffy!

70
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,860
Nami-san!

71
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,080
This is terrible! The whole
town is talking about it!

72
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,830
Luffy! Last night, Iceberg-san
from the shipyard was...

73
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,290
Iceberg-san was shot at his home?!

74
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,130
Hey! Don't be silly!

75
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,420
--Was he killed?!
--Well, hey!

76
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,140
He isn't someone who
makes enemies of people!

77
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,800
Hold on a sec. Calm down, Paulie!

78
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
Listen to me.

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,810
Look, Iceberg-san was found covered
in blood in his room this morning.

80
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,770
He's still in a coma, so he's
unconscious right now.

81
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,860
In any case, come to the
main office immediately!

82
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,620
Lulu! Where's Paulie?

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,870
I just called him. He'll be here soon.

84
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,410
I see.

85
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,920
Newspaper reporters are already here
and it's quite an uproar outside...

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,340
...even though we're the ones who
want to know what's going on.

87
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,720
Although they tore up the whole office,

88
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,300
there's no trace of money
or valuables being stolen.

89
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,680
If it wasn't for robbery, who'd have
a reason to shoot Iceberg-san?

90
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,730
Yeah...

91
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,230
At any rate, we're in big trouble.

92
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,020
The whole town is in a panic.

93
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,820
If something happens to him,
the Galley-La Company--

94
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,740
as well as Water Seven-- will be finished.

95
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,010
Doctor... How is he?

96
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
Hmm...

97
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,360
He was shot twice from the front,
and thrice from behind.

98
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,730
I don't know what happened in that room
last night, but it sure was brutal.

99
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,030
According to the forensics,

100
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,540
there's no trace of locks being
picked anywhere in the building.

101
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,750
The incident occurred in a
room no one could've entered.

102
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,840
The only thing found in the room
was a commonplace mask.

103
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,340
Ice pops was?

104
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,720
They said that he's unconscious right now.

105
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,850
Everyone thinks the world of him. Why...

106
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,270
Who's that, Nami-san?

107
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,480
Someone who helped us yesterday.

108
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
He's the president of the shipbuilding
company and the mayor of Water Seven.

109
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,070
Sounds like he's quite a big shot.

110
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,990
Yeah. You couldn't come up with a
bigger incident than this in this town.

111
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,700
I'll go check.

112
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,080
Wait, Luffy! I'm coming, too!

113
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,630
Well then, let's go look for Robin-chan.

114
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,220
What about you?

115
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,130
Well...

116
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,850
I'll wait a little while and
see how things turn out.

117
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,520
Extra edition! Extra! Extra!

118
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,770
Water Seven's hero-- our mayor,
Iceberg-san-- fell victim to an assassin!

119
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,860
"Mr. Iceberg Falls Victim to Assassin"

120
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,820
This is a news flash about the incident!

121
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,740
Is Iceberg-san okay?

122
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,950
This is terrible. How could this happen to him?

123
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,200
Who did this?!

124
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,950
Who's the culprit?!

125
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,750
The paper doesn't have any clues.

126
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,960
Hey, paper guy! This doesn't have
the crucial piece of information!

127
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,840
What's the deal?!

128
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,670
Such a vicious attack... It must be pirates!

129
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,300
I'd sure like for us to catch them!

130
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,800
There were pirates who went on a
rampage at Dock #1 yesterday, too.

131
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,060
The Mikazuki gang?!

132
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,980
It may be shocking, but I think it
might be the government's doing.

133
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,980
Lulu, what're you saying?!

134
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm talking about Corgy.

135
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,200
Each time he comes to talk to Iceberg-san,
he gets turned down and goes back.

136
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,370
Franky must be the culprit after all.

137
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,790
I don't know what it was all about,
but he must've done it out of spite.

138
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,920
Don't complain about the government.

139
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,790
If someone hears, you'll pay for it.

140
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,380
Is the goal of this unforgivable
culprit to gain wealth or power?!

141
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,390
Who is this assassin who
disappeared without a trace?!

142
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,640
"Mr. Iceberg Falls Victim to Assassin"

143
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,720
Who the hell did it?! I'm not
gonna let him get away with it!

144
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,150
Thank you for riding the train.

145
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,400
We'll be arriving at Blue Station in
the City of Water, Water Seven, soon.

146
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,570
Ah, Paulie-san!

147
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,780
Paulie-san! Please give us
a statement on the incident!

148
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,870
What were you told before you came here?!

149
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,910
Shut up. Get out of my way.

150
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,330
What explanation did your company give you?

151
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,920
Please give us a statement!

152
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,420
Are you deaf? I told you to get out of my way!

153
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,920
Hasn't there been any trouble that could have
caused someone to target Mr. Iceberg's life?!

154
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,300
Anything that comes to your mind!

155
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,680
Any trouble with pirates?!

156
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,260
--Paulie-san! Tell us...
--I said get out of my way!

157
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,260
You dumbasses!

158
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,140
Luffy! I'm right here!

159
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,780
Okay! Hurry, Yagara!

160
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,410
Are you okay, Yagara-chan?

161
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,040
Well then, please get going.

162
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,120
Ow, ow, ow...

163
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,460
It's talking about Iceberg-san.

164
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,000
Hm?

165
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,800
So it's true that he was attacked.

166
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,470
Yeah. Even if we go to the shipyard,
we may not be able to see him like this.

167
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,260
Then, let's go to pops' house.

168
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,850
They said that his private residence
is inside the main office.

169
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,720
Yeah... Because I'm weak...

170
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,390
That large amount of money... They stole it all.

171
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,150
I can't face everyone.

172
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,110
We were finally about to have Merry repaired...

173
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,000
Nami...

174
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,960
What are you thinking about?

175
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,670
Nothing.

176
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,070
Kiwi... Mozu...

177
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,280
Am I dreaming?

178
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,750
No, Bro...

179
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,290
This is, without a doubt,
the place where Franky House was.

180
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,380
But this is...

181
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
...terrible...

182
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,930
What the hell is going on?!

183
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,950
Who did this while I was gone?

184
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,990
I see... It must be them.

185
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,450
How dare you, Straw Hat Luffy?!

186
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,120
So you did this as retaliation for my
stealing your 200 million Berries?

187
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,670
How dare you do this to
my precious underlings?!

188
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,920
How cold-blooded...

189
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,420
I won't forgive you.

190
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,050
Big Bro Franky!

191
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,260
You're back!

192
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,050
Bro!

193
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,270
Oh, you guys are okay? Good.

194
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,820
We had a terrible time.
Those guys are really crazy.

195
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,070
We want you to get revenge for us at any cost,

196
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,530
so we've been spying on
the Straw Hats' movements.

197
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,490
Where are they?

198
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,660
We saw them going into an inn.

199
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,040
From there, they headed to the
shipbuilding island a bit ago.

200
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,960
I bet they went to the place
they went yesterday, Dock #1.

201
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,380
Okay... I got it.

202
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:36,590
Straw Hat Luffy... I'll crush you without fail!

203
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,980
Grandma! Grandma!

204
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,230
The wind is blowing like crazy! Hey, Grandma!

205
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,030
Crazy wind! Crazy wind!

206
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,790
--Crazy wind!
--Don't romp around.

207
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,750
It's a southern wind... Karock, huh?

208
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,720
The waves are becoming quite rough, too.

209
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,060
As it stands, the sea train service
will have to be stopped tonight.

210
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,980
Chimney! Gonbe! Get ready
to go back to the island!

211
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,100
Okay!

212
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,620
Aqua Laguna is coming.

213
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,630
Attention, please.

214
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,590
This is the Water Seven
Weather Forecasting Center.

215
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,800
An Aqua Laguna warning has just
been issued for the entire island.

216
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,260
Its arrival time at Water Seven is
estimated to be after midnight tonight.

217
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,850
Oh, yeah... It's that time of the year.

218
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,350
I was preoccupied with Iceberg-san's incident.

219
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,560
Hey! Aqua Laguna is coming!

220
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,480
Let those who didn't hear
the warning yet know!

221
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,530
No more working today!

222
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,200
What's going on?

223
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,280
Aqua Laguna?

224
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,660
Oh, excuse me.

225
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,740
What was that broadcast about?

226
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,790
What was it about? Of course it's...

227
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,370
Oh, are you a traveler?

228
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,040
Well, you came here at a bad time.

229
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,580
Hm?

230
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,960
Aqua Laguna is a storm surge.

231
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,380
A storm surge, huh?

232
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,720
That's right. Make sure you
evacuate to high ground.

233
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,600
This town will be submerged in the sea.

234
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,470
The town will be submerged...?

235
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,640
Don't worry. It's not going
to happen right away.

236
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,860
According to the forecast, it'll be
here around midnight tonight.

237
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Well, this happens every year. Be careful!

238
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,530
Okay.

239
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,650
It'll be submerged in the sea?

240
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,320
What?! This place will sink?!

241
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,990
Sounds like it. At any rate,
let's hurry and find Robin-chan.

242
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,000
Yep.

243
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,580
By the way, where should we look?

244
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,880
Well... where would she be likely to go?

245
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,380
Hmm... Let's see...

246
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,340
Ruins, maybe?

247
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,430
There probably aren't any here.

248
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,550
Anywhere else?

249
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,720
Don't know...

250
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,220
Then, what does she like?

251
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,270
--That'd be ruins!
--You keep saying that!

252
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,730
Then do you know what else she likes?!

253
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,810
I'm asking because I don't know!

254
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,320
Hey, don't get in front of me!

255
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,900
Why not?!

256
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,950
Could it be that we don't know
anything about Robin-chan?

257
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,630
Please tell us something!

258
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,790
--Iceberg-san!
--What the hell happened?!

259
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,590
What's going on?!

260
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,840
We can't enter, huh?

261
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,100
We'll have to see Ice pops sooner or later.

262
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,140
Say, excuse me. Do you know where
the entrance to the main office is?

263
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,560
Oh, it's no use. You go in through Dock #1,

264
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,940
but only concerned parties and
certain reporters are allowed inside.

265
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,650
It's not just you guys. Everyone is so
worried that they can't just sit and wait.

266
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,860
I see... Thanks.

267
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,120
What's all this fuss about?
Lots of people are here.

268
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,830
Well, the bigger the audience, the better.

269
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,590
Ahh! This rhythm is...

270
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,470
Don't tell me...! Oh, no...!

271
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,930
Why at a time like this?!

272
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,850
Hey, you guys! Did you just call my name?!

273
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,600
We didn't! Go away!

274
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,770
Where?! Where is he?!

275
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,570
Ahh! He's over there!

276
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,900
--He's here!
--Yow! Yow!

277
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,530
Yow! Yow!

278
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,450
Come now, don't be shy, ask me my name!

279
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,790
We don't wanna ask! Get lost!

280
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,000
You're the one who attacked
Iceberg-san, aren't you?!

281
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,330
--What?! He did it?!
--It's gotta be him!

282
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Be gone from this island!

283
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,800
You should be sent to the gallows, you punk!

284
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,220
Geez... what noisy flies...

285
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,640
I'm the No. 1 super guy!

286
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,980
The face of the Water Seven underworld!

287
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,890
That's right! People call me... wow...

288
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,150
...Franky!

289
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,790
Show yourself, Straw Hat!

290
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,070
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

291
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,610
Chasing after something constant

292
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,200
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

293
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,490
Even when we're exhausted

294
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,660
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

295
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,090
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

296
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,010
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

297
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

298
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,760
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

299
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,850
Eternally... Eternally...

300
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,640
Wild fantasies from our childhood

301
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,480
We trace unforgettable memories

302
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,150
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

303
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,990
To this familiar sunny sky

304
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,780
Together we entrust our feelings

305
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,370
We go beyond the changing time

306
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,000
Eternally... Eternally...

307
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,920
Show yourself, Straw Hat Luffy!

308
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,210
So that guy is Franky?!

309
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,550
Hey, you, bikini guy! I won't
be happy until I beat you up!

310
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,430
I can't take it anymore.
No one can stop me now!

311
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,510
Prepare yourself, Straw Hat!

312
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,480
Whoa! What the hell?!
He breathed fire! That's kinda cool!

313
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,810
Don't tell me he's got Devil Fruit powers?!

314
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

315
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,190
"Gum-Gum Human vs. Fire-breathing Cyborg"

316
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
