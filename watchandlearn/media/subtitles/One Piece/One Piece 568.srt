00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,700
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,310
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,520
On their way to the New World,

78
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,440
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man

79
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,270
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

80
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,440
where the New Fish-Man Pirates

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,780
who are looking to destroy
the Ryugu Kingdom...

82
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,280
...assisted by Vander Decken,

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,070
who is after Shirahoshi, are
engaging in secret maneuvers.

84
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,620
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil and...

85
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,870
The Noah is already...

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,070
...stopped!

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,960
Sea Kings? Why?

88
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,800
Luffy-sama! The wound is opening up again!

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,030
You are bleeding a lot!

90
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,390
Well... Well... That's good...

91
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,790
...as long as the ship is stopped.

92
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,970
I'm glad

93
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,400
everybody's...

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,820
...safe.

95
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,990
"To the Future! The Path to the Sun!"

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,180
Princess Shirahoshi.

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,460
We have been waiting for you
to be born for a long time.

98
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,810
For me?

99
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,520
This ship is designed to be pulled by us.

100
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,700
Since very early times, the
duty has been passed on.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,030
Is that why the Noah is so big?

102
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,300
Yes.

103
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,210
Once in many centuries,

104
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,680
our queen comes into the
world in the form of Mermaid.

105
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,780
I wonder why.

106
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,310
I wonder why as well.

107
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,980
Ever since you were born,

108
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,280
you have been our queen.

109
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,300
Brother!

110
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,020
Yeah, I think Shirahoshi is...

111
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,710
She is talking with the Sea Kings.

112
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,740
I can't believe it!

113
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,910
What is going on, guards?
How did the Noah stop?

114
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,740
Well, actually a group of
Sea Kings showed up here

115
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,000
around the island, out of the blue.

116
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,580
It seemed like they came
to protect the Noah...

117
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,330
...from getting destroyed by Luffy-san.

118
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,840
I wonder if the Noah is something
very important to them.

119
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,550
Neptune-sama?!

120
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,500
Sea Kings...

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,920
It awakes finally-jamon.

122
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,430
The power that could destroy the world!

123
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,530
Look,

124
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,490
the bubble is getting absorbed by the island.

125
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,450
The human can't survive in the deep sea.

126
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,370
You better go and save him.

127
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,960
Luffy-sama! Oh no!

128
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,070
We should go capture Hordy and the others.

129
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,680
Yeah.

130
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
We have to hurry!

131
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,770
Noah... I wonder what
secrets that ship holds.

132
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,030
Am I imagining things?

133
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,200
What?

134
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,520
That human with the hat noticed our voice.

135
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,500
I doubt it.

136
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,630
Something like this happened not so long ago.

137
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,630
Yes, I remember.

138
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,840
Rayleigh, did you just hear that voice?

139
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,350
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,260
It's really quiet down here.

141
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,810
Who are you, talking in such deep sea?

142
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,730
Hey, show yourself!

143
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,000
--I wonder why.
--I wonder why as well.

144
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,040
I wonder if Straw Hat
and the others are okay.

145
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,370
They're strong, aren't
they? Then they're fine.

146
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,630
Uh-huh, we have to trust them, Hatchin.

147
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,880
You're right.

148
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,440
S-Sea Kings?!

149
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,020
They're pulling the Noah!

150
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,070
They're gonna eat us!

151
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,300
The ship is falling apart.

152
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,910
Can it be fixed?

153
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,000
Does it still work?

154
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,530
I don't know.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,380
In order to fix it, we need
help from "them" but...

156
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,330
...times are changing.

157
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,340
Can it be fixed?

158
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,830
I hope it can be fixed...

159
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,860
...by the appointed time.

160
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,360
This is the Ryugu Palace!

161
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,200
Minister of the Left, you
might want to hear this!

162
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,460
What is it?

163
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,330
We found the Mermaids who
had been kidnapped...

164
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,820
...inside the palace!

165
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,760
What?!

166
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,290
Are they all right?

167
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,170
Yes, they are. They say
they still feel groggy

168
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,170
but they remember the
kidnapper's face clearly!

169
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,760
Also, the treasure chamber's been emptied.

170
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
There isn't even a single
piece of treasure left.

171
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,310
Not to mention the national
treasure--the Tamate Box!

172
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,820
King-sama! S-Somebody robbed
the palace while we were gone!

173
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,280
Forget about the treasure thief.

174
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,120
We almost lost the whole
country just now-jamon.

175
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,630
Instead, let the whole nation know
that those Mermaids were okay.

176
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,780
I know it's too late

177
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,830
but we need to clear Straw Hat
and the others' name-jamon.

178
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,440
We did them wrong.

179
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,340
We shouldn't be here!

180
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,330
Hurry up!

181
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,220
They'll catch and kill us!

182
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,430
Let's go! We humans have nothing
to do with this battle!

183
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,100
Where are you going?

184
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,350
Let us go!

185
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,810
Let's fly over him with bubbles.

186
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,000
Water Shot!

187
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,260
I will shoot you down if you
try to fly over me with those!

188
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,530
Dammit!

189
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,320
I beg you, Boss! Let us go!

190
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,870
We were just afraid of Hordy and the others!

191
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,520
We have nothing to do with this
civil war because we're humans!

192
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,820
I thought this island was a tourist spot

193
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,880
largely depending on us
human pirates for money!

194
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,700
Let us get out through the exit!

195
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,540
No one says that you all are
going to get your heads cut off.

196
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,100
Wait for Neptune royal family's decision.

197
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,010
There is something that we would
like all islanders to know.

198
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:22,610
The Straw Hats were not involved in
the kidnap of the Mermaids at all.

199
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,750
We admit that we made a mistake
in our fact-checking process

200
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,290
and we take full responsibility
- we want to apologize.

201
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,840
I didn't think the Straw Hats did it.

202
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,600
I knew it wasn't them the whole time.

203
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
Don't lie!

204
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,560
We all thought that they were the kidnappers!

205
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,310
--N-No, we trusted them, didn't we?
--Y-Yeah.

206
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,770
--Liars!
--Hey!

207
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,020
That's not fair!

208
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,520
He's right!

209
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,400
Admit it.

210
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,070
We didn't trust them.

211
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,950
We didn't trust them because they're humans.

212
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:12,600
That's how we've always treated humans...

213
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,550
Super...

214
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,570
...Afro!

215
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,210
--Franky-san, that's so cool!
--Isn't it super?

216
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,390
Hey Chopper, are you alright?

217
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,690
Yeah... I'm fine...

218
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,890
Whoa!

219
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,900
--Thanks.
--Oh boy...

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,630
When I use the Monster Boost,

221
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,030
I can't even walk for a
couple hours from fatigue.

222
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,870
But I can still treat you.

223
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,000
Is anyone hurt?

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,780
Look who's talking!

225
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,120
Everybody looks okay.

226
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,010
Robin-chan! I used a daring
technique and I'm exhausted too!

227
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,340
Let me put my head in your lap, too! Please!

228
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,090
--Put your stupid head somewhere else!
--You do it!

229
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,630
Luffy...

230
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,810
There they are! Hey!

231
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,690
Prince!

232
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,440
Everybody!

233
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,320
It's the Princes!

234
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,230
I'm glad that they're okay!

235
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,580
--Hordy!
--Vander Decken!

236
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,170
Father! We are sorry to make you worry!

237
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,220
I am glad that you are all okay-jamon.

238
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,710
Well done!

239
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,460
Thank you!

240
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,240
Everybody! No worries!

241
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,410
We won't allow them to make trouble again!

242
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,250
We can live without fear now!

243
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,670
I can't believe there was such an awful
guy so nearby in the Fish-Man District.

244
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,970
--C-Captain Hordy!
--He looks like a monster!

245
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,110
This is great!

246
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,540
Hey, that's...

247
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,190
They are back!

248
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,820
Luffy-san!

249
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,190
Hey, Luffy!

250
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,990
It's Straw Hat Luffy and Princess Shirahoshi!

251
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,480
Please help me!

252
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,450
I cannot stop Luffy-sama's bleeding!

253
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,730
Hey Luffy, stay with us!

254
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,230
Luffy!

255
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,240
Luffy-sama pushed himself
so far in order to save us!

256
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,660
Straw Hat!

257
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,660
This is bad!

258
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,240
There are hemostatics in my backpack!

259
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,460
--Get it for me, Robin.
--Okay.

260
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,000
This makes me worried about how
you'll fight from now on, Doc!

261
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,890
Okay, go ahead!

262
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,650
-I'll help you move.
--We have an odd doctor here!

263
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,970
A little bit to the left.

264
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,930
Will Luffy-sama be all right?!

265
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,770
I can stop the bleeding but he
already lost a lot of blood!

266
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,270
He's lacking blood!

267
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,870
Luffy is the only one  with
blood type F among us.

268
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,240
Oh no!

269
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
There must be somebody in the plaza!

270
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,780
Somebody!

271
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,820
Hey!

272
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,890
Is there someone with blood type F here?!

273
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,050
He needs blood!

274
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,530
Can somebody donate blood?!

275
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,250
Really? Nobody?

276
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,490
My blood type is F.

277
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,290
Mine is F but...

278
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,230
Dad, your blood type is F, isn't it?

279
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,460
Well, I mean...

280
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:36,010
Oh yeah! Donating blood to humans
is prohibited in this country!

281
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,240
What?!

282
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,770
What kind of law is that?!  That's horrible!

283
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,430
I beg you! Luffy is dying!

284
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,600
M-My blood type is not F but mine's red too!

285
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,310
It's no good?!

286
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,650
Yes but thank you for offering!

287
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,740
Princess Shirahoshi...

288
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,990
Oh yeah! There are human pirates!

289
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,020
Hey please! If nothing is
done, Luffy is gonna...

290
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,960
Luffy is gonna die!

291
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,120
Take my blood.

292
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,050
It's F.

293
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,200
You can have as much as you need.

294
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,750
Jimbei!

295
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,530
Jimbei-chan!

296
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,530
But it's against the law...

297
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,830
I am a pirate!

298
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,840
Boss! I'm so glad!

299
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,340
Jimbei-san!

300
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,290
Thank you!

301
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,990
Jimbei, you...

302
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,720
It is okay-jamon.

303
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,010
K-King-sama!

304
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,260
What is so wrong with it?

305
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,720
That old law is also...

306
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,580
...a curse-jamon.

307
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,670
Okay, let me prepare for the procedure.

308
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,440
I'm fine now. I can move for a while.

309
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,980
Let me help with something.

310
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,860
OK, thanks.

311
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,560
Jimbei, it may hurt a little bit.

312
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,160
I don't mind.

313
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,360
If you hurt somebody...

314
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,850
...or if somebody hurts you,

315
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
the same red blood will be shed.

316
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,970
It hardly seems like a path...

317
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,500
...because it's a very thin and narrow
tube - but it makes its way through...

318
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,600
...the prejudice that makes
people fear each other...

319
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,090
...and blood feuds...

320
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,500
...so very easily.

321
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,820
This is a path towards a very real sun,

322
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,270
not some empty wish.

323
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,780
Jimbei...

324
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,330
Luffy-sama, you came to life again!

325
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,530
Luffy!

326
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,240
--Luffy!
--Luffy-san!

327
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,130
What is it?

328
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,210
I didn't know that you were awake.

329
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,640
Straw Hat!

330
