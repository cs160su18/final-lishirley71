2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,130
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,300
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,100
Trying to make it to the scaffold, Luffy
got over the encircling walls with Jimbei's

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,800
The Whitebeards then used their paddle boat
that had been hidden at the bottom of sea...

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,250
...and made it to the plaza, too!

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,290
Second Gear!

65
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,970
You're too slow!

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,060
Go across the sea towards Oars!

67
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,580
We have a problem! Another coated
ship is entering the bay!

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,690
Sink it like the Moby Dick!

69
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,840
No! Not the boat! Shoot at Oars!

70
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,760
He pulled the boat out of water!

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,990
They broke the encircling walls!

72
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,040
Pops!

73
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,170
Stay back, my sons!

74
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,000
Guys! Rescue Ace and...

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,200
...destroy the Navy!!

76
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,740
Garp.

77
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,330
Yeah.

78
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,960
I don't think we can make
it through this unscathed!

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,930
"Luffy at the End of His Tether! An
All-out Battle at the Oris Plaza!"

80
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,320
It's curtains for a Devil Fruit
eater if he falls into the sea!

81
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,490
If nothing is done, I'm
gonna really... really...

82
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,160
...fall... fall...

83
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,830
...fall...

84
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,000
Or not!

85
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,840
You're not gonna fall?! You got me there!

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,560
What are you doing, Ivankov?

87
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,010
Be quiet please! I need to hear
what's going on at the plaza!

88
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,640
Huh? You are the one who is making noise!

89
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,270
Ouch! I got hurt!

90
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm sure that the battle is growing
fiercer on the other side of the wall.

91
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,910
Maybe, Straw boy is already...

92
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,240
...boiled!

93
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,700
Or roasted!

94
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,500
Or iced!

95
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,670
Yeah, maybe that's what happening to him!

96
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,170
Oh no! Oh boy!

97
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,380
What are you doing?! We need to hurry!

98
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,760
It's all your fault, Jimbei!

99
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,080
What?! What did I do?!

100
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,460
Yes! It wouldn't have gone like this if you
had just beaten them and rescued Ace boy already!

101
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,020
That was impossible!

102
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,040
Destroy Navy HQ!

103
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,500
Oars, thank you.

104
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,430
Clear the way in front of me!

105
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,310
Alright!

106
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,770
He's gonna do it again!

107
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,020
I have no choice.

108
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,650
Ice Ball!

109
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,960
--Whitebeard got iced!
--We got him!

110
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,130
Pops!

111
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,690
Oh no! The vibrations can't be frozen!

112
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,610
Ice...

113
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,360
Admiral Kuzan!

114
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,090
--Stabbed with Haki?!
--Did it kill Aokiji?!

115
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,380
No! Don't be ridiculous!

116
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,080
Ice Block: Partisan!

117
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,880
Pops, move on!

118
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm counting on you!

119
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,640
Diamond Jozu!

120
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,060
We're almost there!

121
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,070
The scaffold is right there!

122
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,360
If only we could gain control of this mess!

123
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,990
We won't let you! You all die right here!

124
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,510
Ace!

125
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,620
I thought the war was over once
the walls had been activated!

126
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,770
Damn! Now Whitebeard and Straw
Hat have made it this far!

127
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,500
Next time, I will catch you! I
will be much much stronger and...

128
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,340
I'll become a Navy...

129
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,670
...ad...

130
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,140
...admiral someday!

131
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,060
I made that promise to him
but I haven't changed at all!

132
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,270
Luffy-san!

133
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,770
I've got to fight too!

134
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,450
Straw Hat Luffy!

135
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,750
I, Momonga won't let you pass through here
in the name of the Navy vice admiral!

136
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,050
Vice admiral? The same rank as Grandpa?

137
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,340
Shave!

138
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Moon Walk!

139
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,440
S-Second...

140
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,150
...Gear...

141
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
Seems like you're reaching
your limit! Finger Pistol!

142
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,780
No wonder. He's a rookie after all.

143
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,340
--But...
--Hmmm?

144
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,730
...he's tenacious.

145
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,790
Garp, don't forget that you're one of us!

146
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,240
All you have is courage.

147
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,810
But, Straw Hat Luffy, if
you're not strong enough,

148
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,250
you can't save him no
matter how hard you try.

149
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,880
Ace...

150
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,220
H-He is no competition for an admiral!

151
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,510
No way...

152
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,600
Luffy-san!

153
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,950
--Kill Whitebeard!
--We won't let you!

154
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,660
Why don't you just get lost?

155
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,680
Ace's brother!

156
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,020
Ace...

157
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,510
Whitebeard's command has dulled.

158
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,980
You could've done better than that.

159
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,520
I can't believe that you
let that piece of crap...

160
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,640
...who is so reckless, take the lead!

161
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,360
We won't let you lay a finger on Pops!

162
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,500
How touching!

163
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,160
There he is! Straw boy!

164
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,680
He's there, Jimbei!

165
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,950
--Who is it?!
--Where is that voice coming from?

166
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,960
I knew it! This is exactly
what I thought was happening!

167
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,720
It's up there!

168
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,840
--Why is that face so big?!
--Ivankov of the Revolutionaries army!

169
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,560
--Luffy-kun!
--Are you still alive, Straw boy?!

170
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Oh, I'm gonna fall, gonna fall...

171
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,850
Or not!

172
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,650
You did!

173
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,570
--What are you doing?!
--I'm sorry!

174
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,780
How boisterous you are.

175
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,160
Ivan-chan! Jimbei!

176
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,040
Let me go!

177
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,840
O-Old man! I gotta... I gotta...! Let me go!

178
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,260
--He has done a lot already. Treat him.
--Alright!

179
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,740
You don't need to! There's no time for it!

180
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,220
I gotta go! Just let me go!

181
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,060
Ace is...! Ace is...!

182
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,930
Ace is...! Ace is...!

183
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,940
Ace is my only brother!!

184
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,400
At any cost... At any
cost, I will... I will...

185
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,610
...save him!

186
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,300
--Luffy-kun! Hey!
--It looks very bad!

187
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,130
Please, Surgeon! Save his life!

188
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,340
Luffy-kun! Luffy-kun!
Stay with me, Luffy-kun!

189
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:01,200
He is nothing but a bundle of energy
who just bluffs. Young and clumsy.

190
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,270
But I like fools like him.

191
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,580
Those of you who want to die, come forward!

192
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,740
Watch out, it's Whitebeard!

193
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,140
If I let you wreak havoc,
this island won't survive!

194
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,720
Then why don't you protect it?

195
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,480
Take good care of Luffy-kun!

196
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Jimbei, where are you going?!

197
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,190
I'm willing to lay down
my life at this place!

198
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,330
Stay away! Don't get caught up!

199
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,560
Die!

200
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,460
Dammit!

201
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,430
N-No way!

202
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,090
What a fragile sword!

203
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,280
We'll make way for Pops!

204
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,900
They're swordsmen, too. But...

205
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,740
...poor losers!

206
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,240
Outta my way!

207
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,800
Move out of my way!

208
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,670
I need to reach Luffy! Don't get in my way!

209
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
Oh no!

210
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,600
Boa Hancock is going berserk again!

211
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,150
Slave Arrow!

212
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,120
The number of dead bodies keeps multiplying!

213
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,220
I won't let you bother Pops!

214
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,600
I don't think I taste good.

215
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,650
I-It's not over... yet!

216
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,820
Repel them at once!

217
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,700
They are...

218
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,780
...the allied pirates who
came from the bay head!

219
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,830
Sorry to keep you waiting!

220
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,660
Yeah, we were expecting you!

221
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,790
Damn! We allowed many of
them to reach the plaza!

222
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,790
Uncle won't like this!

223
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,710
It's a melee so a few
mistakes can't be helped

224
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,800
but try not to shoot our soldiers
as much as possible, Pacifistas!

225
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,610
I'm on my way, Ace!

226
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,060
He's flying!

227
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,240
What are you doing? Shoot him down!

228
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,370
It's not working!

229
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,340
It's alright, just keep shooting!

230
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,510
This is no good!

231
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,380
--Go!
--Commander Marco!

232
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,410
Commander Marco!

233
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,180
I never asked you to fight!

234
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,260
The hero--Monkey D. Garp!

235
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,880
--He finally shows himself!
--The legendary Navy soldier!

236
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,110
Vice Admiral Garp!

237
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,320
--Vice Admiral is on the move!
--He'll be the greatest keeper for us!

238
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,780
Old man!

239
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,530
Garp...

240
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,320
If you wanna go further,
you have to kill me first!

241
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,080
You brats!

242
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,880
The Whitebeard Pirates slowly begin to
crumble under the Navy's fierce attacks.

243
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,260
When Ace sees his friends
injured and falling,

244
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,760
he reflects upon his reason for
existing, and tears come to his eyes.

245
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,890
Meanwhile, Luffy makes a decision to
put his life on the line to save Ace!

246
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,260
On the next episode of One Piece!

247
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,480
"The Power That Will Shorten One's
Life! Energy Hormone, Redux!"

248
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
