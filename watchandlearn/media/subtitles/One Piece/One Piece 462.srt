2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
To the future I believe in...

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,370
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,610
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,710
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,630
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,680
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,540
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,280
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,480
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,440
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,390
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ
to rescue his brother, Ace,

63
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,330
who is waiting to be executed.

64
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,700
Meanwhile, the world's
greatest pirate – Whitebeard

65
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,310
has finally appeared...

66
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,480
...at the Navy HQ in Marineford!

67
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,890
He cracked the air?

68
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,800
A seaquake! He's distorting the sea!

69
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,900
I won't...

70
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,280
Still some fight left in you?

71
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,780
You are too valuable to let die now, boy.

72
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,870
If you still wanna run wild,

73
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,210
run as wild as you want
on the sea under my name.

74
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,090
Become my son!

75
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,040
Screw you!

76
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,810
Why...

77
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,810
...do you people call him Pops?

78
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,470
Because he calls us "sons."

79
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,480
We are all hated by the world.

80
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,800
So it makes us happy.

81
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,680
I know it's just a word.

82
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,730
But it still makes us happy.

83
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,570
"The Force That Could Destroy the World!
The Power of the Tremor-Tremor Fruit!"

84
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,990
That's a lie! Cut it out!

85
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,520
You told me not to go but I...

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,810
I'm the one who told you to go.

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm the one who told him to go.

88
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,010
Isn't that right, Marco?

89
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,670
Yes, that's what I heard.

90
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,610
I'm sorry that we put you
through so much, Ace.

91
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,270
Everybody in this world knows.

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,090
What will happen to someone
who messes with...

93
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,750
...our crewmate!

94
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,940
We won't let anybody who
hurts you get away with it, Ace!

95
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,560
Count on us! We will save you!

96
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,310
Prepare yourselves, Navy HQ!

97
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,270
We brought this upon ourselves.

98
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,230
It's too late to say such a thing.

99
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,570
That's so hideous.

100
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,210
On this side, we, The Warlords,
the Navy's greatest powers--3 admirals

101
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,350
and a hundred thousand elite soldiers!

102
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,820
On that side, there are
the Whitebeard Pirates

103
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,130
and more than 40 allied ships!

104
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,180
Now, how do you wanna do it, Whitebeard?!

105
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,180
It's so exciting!

106
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,340
Do you wanna be on the sideline as always?

107
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,810
I know that you just came to kill some time.

108
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,850
So be it.

109
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,560
There are rowdy men everywhere
and I can't stand it.

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,270
He is also a man but he is an exception.

111
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,190
I'm praying for you, Luffy!

112
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,210
H-Hey!

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,420
What's wrong?

114
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,690
The water is receding!

115
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,310
What does it mean?

116
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,620
What's going on?!

117
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,900
The ship is flying backwards!

118
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,650
Is this for real?!

119
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,570
It was really smooth just two minutes ago!

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Why all of the sudden...

121
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,380
Oh no! My waterworks!

122
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,430
We've gotta keep moving!

123
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,550
What's going on here?

124
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,570
This must be...

125
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,150
F-Finally it stopped!

126
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,540
What was that all about?

127
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
We went back a good distance.

128
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,390
I wonder when we can get
to Marineford like this.

129
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,750
Ow, ow, ow...

130
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,030
Wh-What was it?

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,630
Hey, Jimbei!

132
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,670
Can you hurry up? Please!

133
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,060
I gotta get there before Ace's execution!

134
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,030
Don't worry, Luffy-kun. We'll make it!

135
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,150
Okay.

136
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Hey, hey!

137
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,460
How can you be so sure?

138
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Roll-y roll-y.

139
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,500
You think your Fish-Man Karate can help?

140
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,630
Or are you gonna call out
whale sharks to help again?!

141
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,300
My power is not enough.

142
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,740
Then, who are you depending on?

143
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,600
He said we'll make it! So we'll make it!

144
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,730
"He said we'll make it! So we'll make it!"

145
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,890
Fine! Whatever!

146
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,900
That's nonsense.

147
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,390
I'm gonna take a nap.

148
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,320
We can't stick around here any longer!

149
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,200
What happened to your dream to
become the King, Captain Buggy?

150
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,380
Well...

151
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,640
If the time is right,
I'm sure that there'll be a miracle.

152
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,920
But if it's too early,
then I'll just wait for the right timing.

153
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,130
Y-You're gonna just give up?

154
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm disappointed in you!

155
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,970
Can't you see it?!

156
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,670
I mean, can't you see his
magnificent confidence?!

157
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,550
No... It doesn't look like that to me.

158
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,700
This is what they call "perfect composure!"

159
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,580
He's got the regal presence
to become the King!

160
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,390
Now that you mention it, I see it!

161
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,140
How great!

162
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,620
I can't see it at all...

163
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,380
I know that miracles don't happen that often.

164
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,880
But there is nothing I can do but wait.

165
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,640
Dammit!

166
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,760
The tide has changed!

167
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,260
We're going forward!

168
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,740
Did you do something?

169
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,900
I was just steering.

170
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,850
It's speeding up!

171
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,000
C-Could this be...?!

172
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,460
Ouch! What? What happened?!

173
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,740
Captain Buggy!

174
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,410
The miracle that  you were
talking about is about to happen!

175
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,220
I don't think so.

176
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,890
I don't know what's happening
but this is it! Go!

177
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,960
Do you see it, guys?!

178
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,280
The time is calling me now!

179
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,000
Saying "come and become the King!"

180
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,390
You're so great! Like no other!

181
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,680
Yeah! Captain Buggy!

182
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,830
Great! It seems like we can make it!

183
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,290
H-Hey! Look at that!

184
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,790
Wh-What a hell is that?!

185
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,860
They've quieted down all of the sudden.

186
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,000
Are they waiting for Whitebeard's command?

187
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,650
I can hardly breathe!

188
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,580
The water level is rising again!

189
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,360
Wh-What's that?!

190
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,240
I can hear the ground rumbling!

191
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,460
Now it's coming!

192
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,950
The seaquake that he set up before!

193
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,790
Coming in the form of tsunami!

194
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,670
The Tremor-Tremor Fruit
made him a quake man!

195
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,630
Edward Newgate aka Whitebeard!

196
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,090
Look! What is that?!

197
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,350
It's a giant tsunami!

198
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,770
Don't think that our superior forces
will guarantee us victory.

199
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,730
We could well fail.

200
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,810
Because that man has...

201
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,070
...the power to destroy the world!

202
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,660
It's beginning! The war!

203
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,420
Let's go!

204
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,020
The invaders: a fleet of 47 ships
from the New World led by Whitebeard.

205
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,890
The defenders: the 2 greatest
forces of the Government--

206
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,610
Navy HQ and The Seven Warlords.

207
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,640
No matter who wins and who loses,

208
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,610
the times will change!

209
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,140
It's a tsunami!

210
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,680
What power!

211
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,840
He certainly is the legendary monster!

212
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,160
Ice Age!

213
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,520
Aokiji!

214
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,070
You young squirt!

215
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,470
I-It's frozen!

216
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,770
Th-That was close!

217
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,510
Admiral Kuzan did it!

218
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,260
Partisan!

219
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,550
Uh-oh.

220
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,290
The whole bay is frozen!

221
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,970
The ships can't move now!

222
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,290
W-We have the greatest force of the
Navy HQ--the admirals--on our side!

223
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,190
Th-That's right!

224
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,400
There's no reason to be
afraid of the Whitebeards!

225
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,570
Fire! Destroy the Moby Dick!

226
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,790
Let's go!

227
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,620
We've got a good foothold now!

228
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,380
Show them what we're capable of!

229
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,270
The commanders came out, too!

230
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,470
Don't stop firing!

231
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,470
Mount a counter-offensive!

232
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,230
Yes!

233
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
He must be the 5th division
commander - Flower Sword Vista!

234
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,800
Stay alert, Tashigi!

235
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,490
They're all mighty soldiers -
not just the commanders!

236
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,310
Don't forget it!

237
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,980
I-I got it, Smoker-san!

238
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,490
It's nice to have ice in the water!

239
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,620
Because my blood is burning!

240
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,470
Let's shoot them up and invade the island!

241
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,110
It's not that easy, huh?

242
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,940
Here come the vice admirals of the Navy HQ!

243
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,030
It's so rare to see all of them
together at the same place!

244
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,490
It's like when they have
the Buster Call. But...

245
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,610
...when it comes to Pops and us,
it won't work that way!

246
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,620
Tsuru-san, why don't you stand back?

247
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,800
Leave it up to us

248
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,300
and have some tea or something
from a comfortable distance.

249
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,550
Don't talk smart to me, fledglings!

250
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,560
There is no safe place even if
I back up to the end of the sea!

251
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,340
Bring the ship to the ice gorge!

252
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,730
Trounce them all and get to the land!

253
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,070
Go!

254
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,860
We'd be happy to give our lives for Pops!

255
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,800
We're not scared of the Navy HQ!

256
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,610
Let's go, Squard Pirates!

257
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,160
It finally started!

258
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,400
Dracule Mihawk!

259
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,850
Is the Warlord on the move?!

260
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,230
That's very unusual!

261
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,690
The capricious "Hawk-Eye"
seems like he's willing to fight.

262
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,700
What? Do you wanna fight?

263
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,390
I just want to figure
out the true distance...

264
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,660
...between us and that man who
seems like right in front of us.

265
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,150
Even very skilled soldiers would
tremble and freeze from fear

266
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,940
just by looking into his eyes.

267
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,570
He is truly a "Hawk-Eye" as he is called.

268
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,460
I've always wanted to see him.

269
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,740
It's every swordsman's dream
to cross swords with him.

270
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,520
Because he is assumed to be
the strongest in the world.

271
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,360
That's the instinct of swordsmen!

272
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,150
So that's the Black Sword
that everybody's talking about.

273
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,810
To be precise...

274
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,660
...it's Black Sword "Night!"

275
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,240
It's one of the 12 highest
grade swords in the world.

276
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,450
And its dark blade edge has an irregular
temper line and a double clove pattern.

277
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,740
It's a noted sword suitable
for the greatest swordsman.

278
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,550
"Hawk-Eye!"

279
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,460
Mihawk and Kizaru launch
their attacks on Whitebeard.

280
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,680
In response, the Whitebeard commanders

281
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,110
fight back using their own powers.

282
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,160
As the unpredictable battle rages,

283
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,270
Admiral Akainu finally unleashes
his incredible power!

284
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,760
On the next episode of One Piece!

285
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,150
"An All-Consuming Inferno!!
Admiral Akainu's Power!"

286
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,270
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
