Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,130
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,880
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,700
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,650
The scorching land was now
engulfed in wails of grief,

25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,290
along with tremendous upheaval.

26
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,940
Luffy and the others had been
caught in a trap inside Raindinners,

27
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,520
but as a result of Sanji's actions,
they were finally able to escape.

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,330
Marine Captain Smoker, having
been saved by Luffy and company,

29
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,290
then allowed them to get away.

30
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,460
Will Alabasta fall?

31
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,210
Or will it find true peace?

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,470
Moment by moment, the hourglass
of fate marks the final hour.

33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,510
"Merciless Mortal Combat!
Luffy vs. Crocodile"

34
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,390
I see them!

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,020
After them!

36
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,510
Captain, aren't you going after them?

37
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,480
No. I'm too tired.

38
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,590
You're too tired?

39
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey...

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,220
Sir!

41
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,700
It's no use going after those guys.
Tell them to stop.

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,150
And have everyone assemble here.
Contact HQ, too.

43
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,330
Tell them to have all
military vessels in the vicinity

44
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,540
of the Kingdom of Alabasta
gather here, to this land.

45
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,030
You're calling for reinforcements?

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,000
But Captain, I'm not sure
our superiors will be willing

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,620
to move those ships against
such a small number of pirates.

48
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,580
When did I ask for the
opinions of our superiors?

49
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,580
Er, y-yes, sir! Right away!

50
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,130
Hey! Come back! Come back here!

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,180
Hurry!

52
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,440
Mm-hmm, this way.

53
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,150
The scent of Nami's perfume
is getting stronger.

54
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,750
Hey, we're not, by any chance,

55
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,620
just going to run all the way
to Alubarna like this, right?!

56
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,620
That's right, Lashes!

57
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,830
Where has Lashes gone?!

58
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,340
Now that you mention it,

59
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,260
this town has a stable or something!

60
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,660
Let's get horses!

61
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,830
But the marines are in town.

62
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,010
Not to worry. Look in front of you.

63
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,230
Hey, guys!

64
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,770
A crab?!

65
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,180
Chopper!

66
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,140
That's a Moving Crab!

67
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,830
Looks yummy!

68
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,500
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
That's awesome!

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,710
Hop on board!

70
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,460
We get to ride it?! Woo-hoo!

71
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,680
The pleasure's mine!

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,070
Its face looks kind of iffy, doesn't it?

73
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,320
And you've got yet another
amazing thing in tow, huh?

74
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,720
He's Lashes's friend.

75
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,860
Lashes was born in this town,
and has lots of friends in the area.

76
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,810
He is kind of pervy, though.

77
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,050
Amazing! Moving Crabs are
always submerged under the sand,

78
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,000
so they're very nearly phantom crabs!

79
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,910
This guy's pretty fast, isn't he?

80
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,050
Guys, hang on tight!

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,090
All right, let's go! We're off!

82
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,140
What?!

83
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,900
Stop, Chopper!

84
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,490
It's him! Why, you...!

85
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,730
Hey! Luffy!

86
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,790
That idiot!

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,420
Luffy-san!

88
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,380
You guys go on ahead!
I can handle this myself!

89
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,900
Make sure you deliver Vivi back
to her home! Make sure, now!

90
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,510
Make sure, now.

91
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,200
That idiot...

92
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,050
Hey!

93
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,250
Go, Chopper! Keep going, to Alubarna!

94
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,590
G-Got it.

95
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,260
We're off!

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,460
Hold on...!

97
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,930
Hey Zoro, are we leaving
him behind?! Hey, that's cold!

98
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,600
That's cold of you!

99
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,490
From now on, you've got
to protect me, got it?!

100
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,900
Where do you get off always doing this?!

101
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
Luffy-san!

102
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,610
It's all right, Vivi! He'll be fine!

103
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,150
I feel sorry for the other guys.

104
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,250
After all, there isn't a single person

105
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,330
that Luffy has gone after before,
who has come out all right.

106
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,850
Listen to me, Vivi.

107
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,900
He will keep Crocodile under control.

108
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,580
The moment that the
rebel army started running,

109
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,760
the time limit on this land was set.

110
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,580
Once the royal army
and the rebel army meet,

111
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,980
this land, the Kingdom
of Alabasta, will be gone.

112
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,350
If you are the one and only
hope for preventing that,

113
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,180
then you have to survive, no matter what.

114
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,860
No matter what might happen
to any of us here, from now on!

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,030
B-But...

116
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,160
Vivi-chan, this is a fight that you started.

117
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,630
You're the one who ran out
of this land years ago,

118
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,640
and challenged this unknown
organization to battle.

119
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,280
However...

120
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,030
...don't go thinking that
you're fighting alone anymore.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,060
V-V-Vivi! Don't you wor-- wor--
don't worry! I'm g-gonna...

122
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,130
Luffy-san!

123
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,020
We'll be waiting for
you in Alubarna, okay?!

124
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,580
Yeah!

125
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,980
Princess Vivi got away from us, huh?

126
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,860
Either way, the Agents are
scheduled to gather in Alubarna.

127
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,970
Contact them at once.

128
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,820
You've taken your nonsense
a little too far, Straw Hat Luffy.

129
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,850
She tries, you see,

130
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,260
to help everyone she sees,
despite how weak she might be.

131
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,680
She can't bear to abandon anything,
so she's always in pain.

132
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,330
She doesn't think that anyone
needs to die in this revolt.

133
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,720
Nobody needs to die?

134
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,640
There are many maudlin,
peace-loving fools like that.

135
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,110
That's because they don't
know what a real fight is.

136
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,460
You think so too, don't you?

137
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,860
Yeah.

138
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,690
But as long as you're around,

139
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,090
she's going to go at you, until she dies.

140
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,510
So I'm going to put you down, right here!

141
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,460
That's worse than nonsense.

142
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,530
You're the unsalvageable fool here.

143
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,930
This is a good example.

144
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,890
You get close to someone,
and then die because of it.

145
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,170
I've forsaken tons of people like that.

146
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,750
Then, you're the fool, aren't you?

147
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,490
What's so funny?

148
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,330
You want to die, too, Nico Robin?

149
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,040
If you feel like it, go right ahead.

150
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,940
Besides, didn't you promise
not to call me by that name?

151
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,500
Where are you going?

152
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm going on ahead to Alubarna.

153
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,460
I can't figure that woman out.

154
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,510
I'll give you three minutes.

155
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,650
I don't have time...

156
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,000
...to mess with you any longer than that.

157
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,970
I'll give you three minutes.

158
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,860
I don't have time to mess
with you any longer than that.

159
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,760
You don't mind, do you?

160
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,390
No, that's fine.

161
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,590
Gum-Gum...

162
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,370
...Pistol!!

163
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,940
Gum-Gum...

164
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,440
...Stamp!!

165
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,870
I should warn you, Straw Hat Luffy,
that no matter how hard you try,

166
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,220
there is no way that you'll ever beat me.

167
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,830
Gum-Gum Gatling!!

168
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,470
Listen here, Straw Hat Luffy,

169
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,100
you can continue these mosquito-like
attacks of yours forever,

170
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,430
but you will never--

171
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,220
Gum-Gum...

172
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,780
...Bazooka!!

173
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,640
Why, you... you... you...!
Did that smash you?!

174
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,510
You sand gator!

175
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,620
I told you, that won't work.

176
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,350
You bastard...!

177
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,360
No matter how hard a
rubber man like you might try,

178
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,610
there is no way...

179
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,960
...you'll ever peat--

180
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,580
"Peat"? What was that
you were just trying to say?

181
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,460
I think that is just about
enough fun and games,

182
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,930
Straw Hat Luffy.

183
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,860
I've been taking this
seriously the whole time!

184
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,800
But he's got me.
I can't slug him at all like this.

185
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
He's too dry and grainy.

186
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,660
There's a difference in the level
of pirate that you and I are.

187
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,530
Desert Spada!!

188
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,560
Nicely judged.

189
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,970
If you'd taken that, it would have
gotten more than an "ow" from you.

190
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,930
What?! The desert's been split!

191
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,660
Depending on one's training and
how they're used, Devil Fruit abilities

192
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,890
can become a means of
fighting as powerful as any.

193
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm not like you other fools, who are
only preoccupied with your abilities.

194
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,680
You can regret defying me
as much as you want, now.

195
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,330
Desert Girasole!!

196
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,340
What?! What?! What?! What?!

197
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,210
The sand! It's being
sucked into the ground!

198
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,630
You don't know about quicksand?

199
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,360
It makes for a handy desert coffin,
with no need for a tombstone.

200
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,280
The sand is drawn down
into underground waterways.

201
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,050
I am able to detect where those are.

202
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,990
No one in the world can stand up
to me when fighting in the desert.

203
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,410
I'm not about...

204
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,620
...to let myself be buried alive in sand!

205
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,160
You bastard!

206
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,560
Gum-Gum...

207
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,430
...Bazooka!!

208
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,410
If I can't slug you,
then how about I catch you?

209
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,970
Gum-Gum Finger Net!!

210
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,760
Can't you learn anything?

211
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,300
That won't work.

212
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,160
Gum-Gum...

213
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,860
...Whip!!

214
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,170
Are you planning to keep doing that?

215
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,780
Let go of me, you bastard!

216
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,550
Crescent Cutlass!!

217
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,760
M-My arm!

218
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,540
My arm...! My arm...!

219
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,700
It's turned into a mummy!
My arm has become a mummy!

220
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,450
Because of the sand.

221
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,190
The hydration in your arm
has been sucked out.

222
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,410
I could go on wringing the water
out of your whole body like that,

223
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,650
until you shrivel up and die.

224
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,260
Such is the essence of the desert.

225
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,360
Y-You've gotta be kidding me!

226
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,110
I know! Water!

227
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,820
That was worthless.

228
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
Nothing worthless about it!

229
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,980
The dried-up old man
in Yuba spent all night

230
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,350
preparing this water for me!

231
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,730
Luffy-kun, take this with you.

232
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,110
The old guy told me...

233
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,690
...Yuba wasn't going to give in to the sand.

234
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,370
Gum-Gum...

235
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,140
Are you still planning to do something?

236
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,030
...Munch-Munch!!

237
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,340
Don't go pulling ridiculous crap like that!

238
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,140
Die. You, along with the
indomitable land of Yuba.

239
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,730
Your three minutes are up.
Like I said at the start,

240
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,380
I don't have time to hang
around with you any longer.

241
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,610
Sables!!

242
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,450
The sand is nice and dry.

243
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,460
It's a sandstorm! I can see a
sandstorm in the sky to the south!

244
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,630
Take shelter!

245
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,530
Wait, the sandstorm isn't coming this way!

246
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,370
It's headed to the south!

247
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,160
Captain Smoker, over there!

248
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,680
Vivi, what's wrong?

249
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,460
There's a sandstorm over toward Rainbase!

250
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,470
It's him.

251
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,090
Luffy...

252
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,360
Listen here, Straw Hat Luffy.

253
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,880
The prevailing winds here
always blow from north to south.

254
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,260
If this baby sandstorm of mine
were to catch one of them

255
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,700
and grow as it headed south,

256
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,070
where do you think the
larger sandstorm will hit?

257
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,890
South, you say?

258
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,560
Yuba.

259
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,110
Why?!

260
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,280
Hey, you! What are you doing?! Stop it!

261
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Look. Little by little,
it's starting to head south.

262
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,740
That dried-up old man
has nothing to do with this!

263
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,280
Why, you...! Stop it, you!

264
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,240
Stop, you bastard! Stop!

265
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,160
Give it up, it won't work.

266
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,130
That sandstorm will pick up strength,

267
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,140
and obtain wind speeds
that even I can't stop.

268
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,030
You've gotta be yanking me!

269
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,090
Yuba is finished.

270
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,600
Stop it! Right now! Stop--

271
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,840
Who do you think I am?

272
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,450
There are any number
of rookies like you,

273
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,310
who are nothing but talk,

274
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,090
Straw Hat Luffy,

275
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,550
here in the Grand Line.

276
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,770
I always wanted to talk about it

277
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:31,580
I couldn't even say half of it

278
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

279
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:55,480
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

280
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,690
Glory glory you're my shine

281
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:06,450
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

282
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:12,200
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

283
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm sure I'll make it there

284
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,720
What?! The crab can't cross this river?!

285
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,210
He's a desert creature,
so he can't handle the water.

286
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,710
But it's still a crab. Do something!

287
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,670
Do something. Scissors-kun.

288
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,890
I know! Scissors loves dancing girls!

289
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,920
Will this do?

290
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,150
You're messing him up with this nonsense!

291
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

292
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,620
"Dash For a Miracle!
Alabasta Animal Land"

293
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
