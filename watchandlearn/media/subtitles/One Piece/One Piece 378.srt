2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,950
"The Promise from a Distant Day!
The Pirates' Song and a Small Whale!"

48
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,330
Okay, close the gate.

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,780
Are you sure we should leave Perona?

50
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,660
We can't take someone we can't find.

51
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,130
Sheesh! Where in the world did she go?

52
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,880
Phew! Okay, you can stop now.

53
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,310
Lift your invisibility power!

54
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,390
We're free and clear!

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,700
I was terrified we'd get
caught the whole time!

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,320
I never did find out what brought
Tyrant Kuma to Thriller Bark.

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,290
About that, Absalom.

58
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,240
Tyrant Kuma came to tell us the name

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,120
of the successor to the
former Warlord, Crocodile.

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,700
His successor...?

61
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,300
Yeah, but that's not the important part.

62
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,120
The successor is a man called Blackbeard.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,220
He's pulled a truly nasty stunt.

64
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,810
Read that.

65
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,840
"Fire Fist Ace, 2nd Division Commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates...

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,400
...has been imprisoned in Impel Down"?!

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,310
It's well known that Ace is
one of Whitebeard's top dogs.

68
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,600
The government just got
their hands on a powerful card.

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,640
Definitely.

70
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,900
Depending on how they play it,
this could completely change the Pirate Era.

71
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,040
We've got a serious situation on our hands!

72
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,070
It's no time for Moria-sama
to be dead to the world.

73
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,590
I see where you're coming from,

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,170
but I'm more interested... in finding a wife.

75
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,920
Okay. Bring me a corpse that turns you on.

76
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,210
I don't want a zombie!

77
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,870
I wanna marry a living woman!

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,670
"One Day After Defeating Moria"

79
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,900
In the end,

80
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,520
everyone slept all day in that courtyard.

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,890
Well, sure. We were up all the
previous night fighting like mad.

82
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,930
I'm starving, Sanji!

83
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,280
Nibble on some cheese.

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,650
Cheese doesn't cut it!
Cheese doesn't energize me!

85
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,530
Then start hauling the ingredients
I need to the courtyard.

86
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,450
I'm sure the members of the Victim
Association don't want to budge.

87
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,070
So we're eating over there.

88
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,450
I'm sorry about that.

89
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,910
Everyone is just so happy to see
the sun for the first time in years.

90
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,630
They are crying tears
of joy while sunbathing.

91
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,670
Where did all of that energy come from?

92
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,300
It's so weird! It's a mystery!

93
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,310
Do you have enough food?

94
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,840
We have a mountain of additional food

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
on top of everything that was stolen.

96
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,090
We're doing great.

97
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,610
I wonder who did that. There are
some nice people out there!

98
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,560
And they even loaded your ship
with all of this treasure.

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Even assuming it was Christmas,
this is far too generous.

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,740
This is bliss!

101
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,150
Oh, a glass armband!

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,610
This is cool!

103
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,960
I claim this!

104
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,750
H-Hey, you know what'll happen
if you take any of the treasure...

105
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,490
R-Right, Nami-san?

106
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,010
He can have it! There aren't any gems.

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,620
Huh? Is that how this works? Cool!

108
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,420
But I don't have a single
piece of treasure for you!

109
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,600
We wouldn't take treasure from
the people who saved us, Namizo.

110
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,800
Huh?

111
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
This is a nice knife!

112
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,090
What did you just say?

113
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,190
I'm sorry! This is out.
It's studded with gems.

114
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,100
Huh? It popped right out.

115
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,360
Who is Namizo?

116
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,390
Come to think of it, this is rather strange.

117
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,650
For some odd reason, I don't feel
like this is the first time we've met.

118
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,290
By any chance, are you Lola?!

119
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,120
Yep. Did I tell you my name?

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,370
So you're Lola!

121
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,740
I'm happy to see you again!

122
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,500
L-Lola...? Wh-Whoa, wait! Just a sec!

123
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,130
That boar zombie was her...?

124
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,600
You must be confused, huh?
I'll fill you in later.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,170
Anyway, take this. It's
my way of thanking you.

126
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,310
Huh? Are you sure? You're thanking me?

127
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,310
Nami gave away some of our treasure!

128
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,350
I'm going on ahead. Is this everything?

129
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,810
A storm is coming!

130
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,320
Huh? A storm? Really?

131
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,120
This is the life!

132
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,830
The light is seeping into my body.

133
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,410
We're really alive.

134
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,480
Hey!

135
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,750
We brought food!

136
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,760
Straw Hat!

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,760
If you told us, we would have carried it!

138
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
We shouldn't let our savior work!

139
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,020
Is Zoro up?

140
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,270
He needs absolute rest,
so he's in the mansion.

141
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,100
Hey, wake up.

142
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,430
Chopper!

143
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,600
We brought the stuff you asked for.

144
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,350
Oh, thank you.

145
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,740
How is he doing?

146
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,330
I've never seen Zoro so badly hurt.

147
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,120
He nearly lost his life.

148
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,830
I think something must have happened...

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,500
...while we were unconscious.

150
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,040
Indeed. I sincerely doubt
that man simply left.

151
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,720
And it's strange how Luffy
is bursting with energy.

152
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,800
I have no idea what's up with that, either.

153
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,550
To be honest, I saw what went down!

154
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,010
I saw what happened from beginning to end!

155
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,390
I'll give you the dirt.

156
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,030
I'll fill you in on what happened!

157
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,980
Come.

158
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,310
Wait! No, wait a second!

159
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,910
--Hold up!
--Sanji?

160
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,540
Wait, why?! You were pretty cool yourself.

161
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,450
You were like, "Instead of the
swordsman's life, take mine."

162
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,290
Drop it!

163
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,310
Now start talking. What happened afterwards?

164
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,730
I want to know what happened
after I blacked out.

165
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,360
Okay...

166
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,510
That Warlord had yet
another shocking ability.

167
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,930
He pressed his paw against Straw Hat.

168
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,580
It repelled all of the "damage"
that Straw Hat had taken!

169
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,820
His damage...?

170
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,250
It was like a bubble of agony. And then...

171
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,790
If you want to take his place,

172
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,670
take all of his pain and
suffering unto yourself.

173
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,200
It will be impossible for you to survive
when you are already on the brink of death.

174
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,520
You will die.

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,500
Have a small taste.

176
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,960
Even the swordsman started
screaming bloody murder

177
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,310
when he touched a small portion of it.

178
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,880
I hate to say it, but I
thought he was a goner.

179
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,280
That's what makes it so touching!

180
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,690
It seriously made me cry!

181
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,690
I see. That explains why Luffy is
doing well while Zoro is bedridden.

182
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,500
That was rash!

183
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,760
Where did all of this blood come from?!

184
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,500
Hey, are you still alive?!

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
Where is he?!

186
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,320
What happened here?!

187
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,810
No...

188
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,840
Nothing happened...!

189
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,100
Come on! Let's tell everyone
about the Straw Hats' heroic story.

190
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,690
Yeah! I'm itching to tell them!

191
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,660
Wait!

192
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,520
Don't be insensitive.

193
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,700
He didn't risk his life out of
a desire to earn our gratitude.

194
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,240
What would happen if they learned that
Luffy's pain hurt a friend?!

195
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,810
Especially Luffy!

196
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,300
Just how badly are you
dying to tell everyone?!

197
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,370
We can't tell them?

198
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,190
You're killing me!

199
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,300
All that matters is that everyone is okay.

200
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,720
Come on! Let's go eat.

201
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,390
Th... Th-Th...

202
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,930
These guys are super cool!

203
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,890
Their captain is so lucky!

204
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,410
So that explains it.

205
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,410
Hey, you two!

206
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,240
Weren't you acting like you knew
what happened? What did you see?

207
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,930
Don't ask such an insensitive question.

208
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,180
All that matters is that everyone is okay.

209
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I-I wanna tell them!

210
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,190
K-Keep that manly heroic story to yourself!

211
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,870
Wh-What gives?

212
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,230
Thank you for the food!

213
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,650
Delish! I've never eaten
such good food before!

214
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,650
Oh, here! Try this! This!

215
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,540
Yeah! It's been years since
we've eaten a decent meal.

216
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,410
I'm glad to be alive!

217
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,580
I cooked up a storm!
Don't let it go to waste.

218
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,630
To think I get to eat your cooking again!

219
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,890
This really is lip-smacking good!

220
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,390
Not that I have any lips!

221
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,620
You need to shut up and eat!

222
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,770
That skeleton is hilarious!

223
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,180
But honestly--oh, pardon me.

224
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,560
After eating until I was full
both yesterday and today,

225
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,860
I may have gained weight!

226
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,210
"Even though I'm a skeleton!"
I can't take it anymore!

227
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,410
Skeleton, you rock!

228
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,810
How come that skeleton is able to talk?

229
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,580
And he's a hoot!

230
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,080
You're a clever skeleton, you know that?

231
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Why are you able to move around?

232
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,760
Hey, it doesn't really matter!

233
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,550
--Oh, dinner!
--Wow!

234
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,080
--Dinner!
--Yay!

235
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,920
--Dinner!
--Oh, baby!

236
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,540
--Dinner!
--Come on!

237
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,660
--Dinner!
--Super!

238
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,210
We didn't have a toast
and it still turned into a party.

239
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,980
He's sleeping right through all this noise...

240
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,010
And here he's the toughest guy in the crew...

241
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,800
Hey, Chopper! Look!

242
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,300
--Luffy!
--This is for Zoro.

243
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,590
Now drink away!

244
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,750
Don't give it to him!

245
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,550
Why not?! This will fix Zoro
right up, since it's his favorite.

246
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,770
What type of treatment is that?!

247
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,850
That won't work? Then how about meat?

248
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,230
Okay, okay. I'll gladly accept
your sentiment alone.

249
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,740
But only your sentiment!

250
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,070
There was a piano in this room?

251
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,070
Hey, I thought you only played the violin.

252
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,170
I can play most instruments.

253
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,320
Really? You're pretty good.

254
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,110
Um, I'd like to touch on
an earlier conversation.

255
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,480
To be honest, I also saw what happened.

256
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,460
I was greatly moved by what you two did.

257
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,150
Isn't it wonderful to have comrades?

258
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,660
Don't include me in that.
I merely made a fool of myself.

259
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,270
No, you bore the same resolve.

260
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,920
Would you like to pick a song?
I'll take a request.

261
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,450
Yeah? I can request anything?

262
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,550
In that case...

263
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,130
And then...

264
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,470
♪ Yo-ho ho ho, yo-ho ho ho... ♪

265
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,770
--Wait, didn't you just ask for a request?!

278
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,020
"Bink's Booze." I thought
I recognized the song.

279
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,950
This takes me back.

280
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,450
Whee! Yahoo! Keep it going!

281
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,820
Hey, Brook! I know this song.

282
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,500
Shanks and the guys used to sing it.

283
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,760
Yeah. A long time ago,
all of the pirates would sing this.

284
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,710
They sang it in good times and bad.

285
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,510
So you're gonna join our crew now, right?

286
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,150
After all, you've got your shadow back!

287
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,010
You can hit the seas without
fear of the sun, right?

288
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,150
About that. There was one thing
I neglected to tell you.

289
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,820
What is it?

290
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,520
I promised one of my comrades something.

291
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,320
I must tend to that first
or I will lose face!

292
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,500
Yeah. You're talking
about Laboon, aren't you?

293
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,880
I know all about it.
Franky and Robin told me.

294
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,500
Huh? Oh, that's right.

295
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,590
Laboon!

296
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,080
That is the name of the whale.

297
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,560
He is at a certain cape--

298
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,070
Listen, Brook! We met Laboon
at Twin Cape. Honest!

299
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,560
I already knew that Laboon

300
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,480
had been waiting there for his friends

301
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,410
to return for the past fifty years.

302
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,000
Skeleton, what's wrong?
The tempo is getting slow.

303
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,930
This is the symbol of
our promise to fight again.

304
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,580
Until we come back, don't remove that
mark by hitting your head. Got that?!

305
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,750
All right!

306
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,070
See ya, whale! I'm leaving now!

307
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,540
Boy, was I ever surprised when I learned
that you're the surviving member

308
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,870
of the band of pirates he's been waiting for.

309
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,570
And you still remember your promise to him.

310
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,070
I bet Laboon would be thrilled if he knew!

311
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,400
J-Just a moment, please!

312
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,310
I'm shocked! This is so sudden.

313
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,400
Is it true? Did you actually meet Laboon?

314
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,250
Yup.

315
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,580
Even though fifty years have passed?

316
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,050
Laboon is still waiting for us at that cape?

317
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,710
Are you telling the truth?!

318
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,340
Yup!

319
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,000
We also bore witness.
We saw him with our own eyes.

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,060
Yeah!

321
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,390
Was he well?

322
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,880
Sure was!

323
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,190
He was as big as a mountain.

324
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,140
I'd love to see him!

325
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,990
When we left him, the cutie
was about the size of a boat.

326
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,530
He had a stubborn streak, but he loved music.

327
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,340
He was a good boy...

328
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,830
Even now, I can still...

329
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,830
...picture him...

330
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,050
Is that right?

331
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,160
He's doing well?

332
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,530
I have never been this happy in my life!

333
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,660
Where did that whale come from?
It's following our ship.

334
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,700
It must have gotten separated from its pod.

335
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,800
The poor thing. The ocean is a big place!

336
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,040
It looks sad. Well, it's still just a calf.

337
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,220
Captain Yorkie, why don't we play a song?

338
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,160
Great idea, Brook! Hey, everyone!
Grab your instruments.

339
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,360
Okay!

340
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,320
Let's show him what the
Rumbar Pirates that make

341
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,790
crying children laugh are made of!

342
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,020
Sounds good!

343
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,120
One, two, three, four!

344
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,380
Laboon, you are our dear comrade!

345
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,180
That's why we can't take you with us.

346
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,920
The Grand Line is so dangerous,
we want you to wait here.

347
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,500
We will swing around the Grand Line.

348
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,890
I swear we will come back
to this cape to see you again!

349
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

350
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,010
"Brook's Past! A Sad Farewell
with His Cheerful Comrade!"

351
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
