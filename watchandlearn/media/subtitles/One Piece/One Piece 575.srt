Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates, once
attained everything this world has to offer.

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,960
The words he uttered just before his death
drove people around the world to the seas.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,360
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,840
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,510

a Great Pirate Era!

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,520
Finally!

38
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,460
Finally, the Great Pirate Era is coming to an end!

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,920
Master Z!

40
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,230
Meanwhile, the Straw Hats have left the Fish-Man Island and are headed for the New World.

41
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:49,290
"Z's Ambition!
Lily the Little Giant!"

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,580
Wh-What's going on here?!

43
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,390
Are they really the Navy?!

44
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,170
Here, there, everywhere! 360 degrees!

45
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,050
We're totally surrounded!

46
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,080
Only the Navy could accomplish this. They know every move that we make.

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,470
We're totally surrounded. There is nowhere to run.

48
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,270
You two, stop talking in such a cool manner!

49
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,640
The weather...

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,810
They're closing in on us!

51
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,050
What are we gonna do, Luffy?!

52
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,900
Oh? Where did he go?

53
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,530
Go forward!

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,410
Let's keep moving forward like this!

55
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,330
Guys!

56
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,120
They outnumber us!

57
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,570
There's no time to argue!

58
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,010
Usopp, get ready to fire at them! Chopper, fill the tank with cola!

59
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,560
I don't care anymore!

60
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,260
I'll take the front!

61
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,120
Leave the sides to us!

62
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,260
I'll handle the rear!

63
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,560
Bring it on!

64
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,060
We're ready!

65
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,800
Usopp, wait!

66
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,980
There's no need to fight.

67
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,310
Why not?

68
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,520
Third Gear!

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,860
Gum-Gum...

70
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,120
...Giant Pistol!

71
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,740
Oh?

72
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,040
The warships are vanishing one by one!

73
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,410
It stopped raining too!

74
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,990
I thought so.

75
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,160
What's going on?

76
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,710
What we're seeing was a mirage only found in this area.

77
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,270
A mirage?!

78
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,990
I'm so relieved!

79
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,460
Don't drop your guard yet.

80
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,390
If I'm...

81
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,800
...right...

82
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,320
What the hell is that?!

83
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,660
Huge raindrops!

84
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,390
What's this weather?!

85
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,860
We're in the Maubeugemour Sea!

86
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,650
Momemomejuban?!

87
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,420
No, "Maubeugemour"! Also known as the "Ill-Tempered Sea"!

88
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,480
Home to weather conditions you've never seen or heard of before!

89
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,540
--Hail?
--It's such a dangerous sea!

90
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,610
It's gonna hit us!

91
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,590
360...

92
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,630
...Pound Phoenix!

93
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,500
Damn!

94
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,510
Oh, cotton candy?

95
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,720
Now there's an avalanche from the sky!

96
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,640
Mil Fleurs!

97
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,600
Gigantesco Mano!

98
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,900
Nice, Robin!

99
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,490
It started raining hard!

100
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,820
I hope it's just rain!

101
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,410
What is it this time?!

102
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,350
D-Don't tell me...

103
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,290
The water split!

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,000
So pretty much anything goes here?

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,370
We're sinking!

106
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,880
If nothing is done, we're gonna end up back in the deep sea!

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,060
No, we'll hit a rock and drown before that.

108
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,340
Don't say it so casually!

109
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,260
What an amazing phenomenon!

110
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,560
Now's not the time to be impressed!

111
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,270
How do we escape?!

112
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:54,870
Punch.

113
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,930
--Cut.
--Kick.

114
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,760
Alright!

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,610
No, that won't do!

116
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,980
Leave it to the Sunny!

117
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,850
Coup de...

118
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,480
...Burst!

119
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,780
Yeah!

120
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,620
--Cool!
--He did it!

121
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,410
It's baking hot now.

122
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,220
--It's sweltering...
--That was close.

123
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,500
But I'm impressed, Nami-san. You know about the weather in the New World.

124
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,850
I studied as much as I could about the New World over the past 2 years.

125
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,350
I want a beer when it's hot.

126
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,980
--I'm hungry!
--Me too.

127
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,460
Oh yeah! We caught a deep-sea fish!

128
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,120
Unfortunately, most of it was ruined by the horrible weather.

129
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,160
What?!

130
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,200
But I had already set aside some.

131
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,160
Just give me some time and I'll cook something.

132
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,170
First, I'll just whip up some carpaccio.

133
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,520
Today's soup will be deep-sea fish bouillabaisse. What should I make for the main dish?

134
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,080
Okay, it's done! Come and get it!

135
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,430
Yeah!

136
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,390
Looks great!

137
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,400
Food! Food! Food! Food!

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,980
Let's eat!

139
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,900
Eat it and wait. It's deep-sea fish carpaccio.

140
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,560
--There's nothing here!
--No, it's on the platter.

141
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,330
There is a platter here but nothing is on it!

142
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,610
What are you talking...

143
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,500
It's gone!

144
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,270
Oh? Huh?

145
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,090
--Boo! Boo!
--Did you guys eat it already?!

146
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,560
No, we didn't!

147
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,450
Then who did?!

148
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,400
Maybe the Maubeugemour Sea is haunted!

149
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,350
Yummy!

150
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,680
A ghost!

151
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,640
The soup is all gone!

152
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,690
What?!

153
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,510
What's that?! Something came out!

154
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,810
A bug?

155
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,310
A bug ghost!

156
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,240
--Did the bug eat it?!
--No way.

157
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,030
The strawberries are gone!

158
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,790
--What?! The corn is gone!
--Really?!

159
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,850
Dammit! This is unforgivable!

160
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,920
Luffy, it went outside!

161
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,250
I have a bad feeling.

162
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,630
--The fridge is empty!
--What?!

163
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,570
Where did it go?! I lost it!

164
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,180
--What's going on?
--We found a bug ghost!

165
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,310
And a food thief!

166
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,270
What do you mean "thief"?!

167
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,080
I just ate what I found sitting around.

168
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,400
Huh? Me?

169
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,310
That's what we call a "thief"!

170
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,870
What?! Why are you doing this to me, Luffy-san?!

171
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,370
It got out!

172
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,160
--Where?
--Oh? Where did it go?

173
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,000
All the food in the fridge is gone too! The booze as well!

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,710
What?!

175
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,250
Where did it go?!

176
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,500
You're...

177
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,670
...a human?!

178
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,880
How dare you steal my food!

179
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,050
Here it is!

180
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,010
Oh?

181
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,770
Damn!

182
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,320
--Hey, catch her, Franky!
--I got it!

183
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,940
I can't get caught now!

184
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,270
Stop!

185
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,100
She took Franky down! She's strong!

186
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,200
Looks like we gotta go all out.

187
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,580
I have no choice!

188
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,420
Take the Mini-Mini Full Rebound!

189
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,300
Oh, wow!

190
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,890
She's...

191
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,850
Gigantic!

192
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,160
How cool is that!?

193
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,440
You're amazing, mega young girl!

194
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
Run!

195
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,110
Now, come to me!

196
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,330
--Oh no!
--She's gonna stab us!

197
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,450
No hard feelings!

198
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,660
I'll fight you!

199
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,580
Alright! Here I go!

200
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,450
What?

201
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,510
Nice, he lifted her up!

202
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,630
Gum-Gum Propeller!

203
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,720
What's going on?!

204
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,050
Propeller Wind-Down!

205
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,160
Wh-What? She can't swim?

206
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,310
Young girl, I'm coming for you!

207
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,030
Maybe, she's a Devil Fruit eater.

208
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,050
Dad, I'm sorry...

209
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,060
I don't think I can make it...

210
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,290
Why is she shrinking?

211
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,910
Dad! Dad!

212
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,820
I'll save you at any cost!

213
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,030
Wait for me, Dad!

214
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,750
Dad!

215
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,310
Oh, good.

216
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,690
--She woke up.
--Young girl, you okay?

217
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,740
Hey, you!

218
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,490
Luffy! Don't use violence against a lady again!

219
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,010
You can grow and shrink! That's awesome!

220
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:59,420
I-I was born a Giant but I ate the Mini-Mini Fruit and...

221
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,620
You're a Giant?!

222
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,710
Yes, but this is my usual size now.

223
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,890
However, I can shrink myself down to 5 millimeters and enlarge myself to the size of the Giants.

224
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,200
Hmmm... You're interesting!

225
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,390
--Am I?
--Yeah!

226
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,770
And you're strong too! Although you're small, you took Franky down!

227
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,220
Even when I'm small, I still have the power of the Giants.

228
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,280
That was easy!

229
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,290
Like this!

230
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,530
You're strong!

231
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,330
He totally forgot that she ate all of our food.

232
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,430
Boy, they're having fun.

233
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,250
Is there anything else you can do?

234
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,880
Yes, I have another technique.

235
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,340
I can get smaller and slip into my enemy's body

236
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,720
then expand myself to break him into pieces!

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,140
No way!

238
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,080
That way, I can become a Giant!

239
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,600
What do you mean by that?

240
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,150
Luffy is a rubber man. So instead of breaking into pieces, he stretches.

241
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,970
I can't believe it! You're right, how interesting!

242
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,360
By the way, young girl, what's your name?

243
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,080
My name is Lily Enstomach. People call me "Lily the Glutton"!

244
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,780
I eat a lot for a woman, right?

245
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,540
Lily, why are you aboard this ship?

246
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,500
"Why"?

247
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,250
I was waiting for someone

248
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,130
when your ship flew out of the water all of a sudden!

249
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,830
Who were you waiting for in the middle of nowhere like this?

250
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,780
I was waiting for my dad...

251
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,170
I shouldn't be wasting my time like this!

252
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,190
What's the matter, Lily-chan?

253
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,480
Calm down! The size of your head doesn't match your body anymore!

254
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,410
The bottle was shattered! What should I do?!

255
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,220
I finally made it this far by sneaking aboard some Navy boats and warships!

256
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,640
I can't get to my dad!

257
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,940
Dad? Are you looking for your father?!

258
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,850
What kind of man is your father?

259
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,980
My dad is the greatest pirate chef in the New World!

260
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,480
A pirate chef? Lily-chan, what's your father's name?

261
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,380
It's Panz Fry.

262
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,360
Yeah, I know his name!

263
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,070
Is he that famous?

264
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,300
He's a top volcano cooking chef!

265
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,740
Volcano cooking?! What's that? Is it delicious?!

266
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,210
Oh yeah! I'm getting excited just by thinking about it...

267
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,640
It's my favorite food - churrasco sea monster!

268
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,190
Rare herbs that only grow around volcanoes

269
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,230
and million-year-old salt crystals  from between molten rocks.

270
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,090
All sprinkled on sea monster meat and stewed in a volcano

271
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,020
to cook it up quick!

272
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,100
Sounds yummy!

273
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,730
That's not all! The best one is...

274
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,760
Go on!

275
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,320
A frying pan filled with an assortment of foods from the sea and mountains...

276
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,130
...all cooked over a volcano! It's called Thousand-Person Paella!

277
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,160
Just one taste and...

278
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,370
ﾉit's like slipping into a dream!

279
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,450
It's just like running  through a field of flowers in heaven!

280
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,250
I wanna eat it! I wanna run in heaven!

281
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,300
Heavenly food! Yeehaw!

282
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,190
No, I don't have time for this!

283
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,350
You started it!

284
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,140
I've heard about Panz Fry before too.

285
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,130
He steals food from the Government, the Navy, and other pirates

286
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:52,070
and likes nothing better than to cook for starving people.

287
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,650
He sounds like...

288
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,360
...a hero!

289
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,740
A Hero? I'm flattered!

290
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,950
I have no time to be flattered!

291
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,030
Enough with that. Tell us what's going on.

292
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,710
Okay. I was pirating around with Dad for a long time

293
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:15,830
but he went missing all of a sudden a couple weeks ago.

294
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,010
They say the Navy took him.

295
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,430
I was asking around going island to island

296
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,940
then I read in the paper that he'll be taken to Impel Down.

297
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,270
Impel Down?

298
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,090
Why is that? He's a hero!

299
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,950
Because Dad has a 320 million berry bounty.

300
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,250
Over 300 million?! Really?!

301
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,870
He kept stealing food from the Government and the Navy so the price went up before he knew it.

302
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,040
And I managed to get this far but...

303
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,880
...the ship I was on was wrecked by this weather.

304
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,970
And I didn't know what to do.

305
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,090
You're a good girl! You love your dad so much!

306
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,720
But of all places - Impel Down...

307
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,120
That prison has no mercy. I almost died there.

308
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,530
I wasn't planning on going there.

309
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,810
What about your dad?!

310
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,880
Well, when I was hiding in a warship, I heard them talking.

311
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,110
We're traveling across the Maubeugemour Sea carrying Panz Fry.

312
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,080
The ship carrying Dad will pass through here!

313
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,110
You mean the Navy is coming?!

314
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,400
If they see us, it's not gonna be pretty!

315
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Yeah. But I have to save Dad at any cost!

316
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,930
Before they take him to Impel Down,

317
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,050
this is my last chance to save him!

318
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,350
Lily-chan...

319
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm sorry for everything.

320
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,500
I don't want to cause you guys trouble anymore.

321
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,370
If you just give me an empty bottle, I'll get off of this ship.

322
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,460
You guys better get away from here.

323
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,990
Lily.

324
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,240
Let me...

325
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,110
...help you!

326
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,810
I wanna try that heavenly food that only your dad can make!

327
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,750
And besides, he's a hero!

328
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,460
I wanna see the hero!

329
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,420
But that's too...

330
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,400
That's what we do. So don't worry, Lily-chan.

331
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,760
We have no choice!

332
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,890
If we don't help her now, it's a dishonor to our pervert name!

333
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,520
Our first fight in the New World will be against the Navy! I can't wait!

334
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,500
It must be karma!

335
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,570
You guys! Are you sure about this?

336
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,710
Yeah! Count on us!

337
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,070
Luffy! Everybody!

338
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,240
When we rescue him, let me have some of that heavenly volcano food!

339
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,660
Yeah! Of course!

340
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,750
I'll make sure you have enough until your stomach bursts!

341
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,180
Shuzo-san! Come in! Shuzo-san!

342
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,020
What do you want? Our commander is unavailable.

343
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,140
I'll take your message.

344
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,680
All ships were required to turn out today. Why aren't you here yet?

345
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,270
Hey, what's wrong? Answer me! Where are you now?

346
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,900
I know you are there.

347
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,260
Ain-san?

348
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,890
You're there, aren't you, Shuzo?

349
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,410
We're heading there.

350
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,630
We'll get to the Maubeugemour Sea soon.

351
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,980
Why are you taking such a long way round?

352
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,760
You obviously don't understand how important this plan is.

353
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,920
No, I understand very well.

354
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,640
--Then why...
--I heard...

355
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:02,830
...that a ship carrying Panz Fry, that big-shot pirate, will pass through the Maubeugemour Sea soon.

356
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,010
We don't wanna miss this opportunity and let him continue to live in Impel Down.

357
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,210
All pirates in the New World must be exterminated!

358
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,670
I thought that was what we Neo Navy really want!

359
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,570
We can't give the Navy onto our plan by letting you do whatever you want.

360
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,570
You better come here now.

361
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,600
Don't worry.

362
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,730
If we sink him with the Navy and all, there'll be no evidence.

363
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,570
I'll pull off this operation...

364
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:45,220
...and prove that  I will be a better right-hand man to him...

365
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,340
...than you!

366
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,740
If you fail... You know the consequences.

367
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
Yes.

368
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,720
Clank!

369
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,890
Brat.

370
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,540
Listen, all of you!

371
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:07,880
Let's make the foolish Navy realize how formidable we Neo Navy are!

372
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,480
Get ready to surface!

373
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,970
Yes, sir!

374
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,940
Whoa, what's going on with the weather now?

375
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,440
A mirage, again?

376
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,280
I think it's just fog.

377
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Visibility is going down.

378
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
It'll be harder to find your dad.

379
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,110
Yeah.

380
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,990
Hey, Lily, look!

381
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,360
It's the Navy!

382
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,960
Dad!

383
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,010
Is that him?

384
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
SIN

385
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,820
All right, guys!

386
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,990
Let's go and take Lily's dad back!

387
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,750
Nami's plan to rescue Lily's father is put into action.

388
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,340
But events take an unexpected turn...

389
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,200
...and escalate into a full-scale war between the Straw Hats and the Navy.

390
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,090
Just as the fierce battle concludes and the rescue appears successful...

391
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,810
...both the Straw Hats and Navy are attacked...

392
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,770
...by a new enemy.

393
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

394
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,630
"Z's Ambition! A Dark and Powerful Army!"

395
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,040
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
