00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,920
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,470
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,470
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,190
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,710
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,980
He was shot twice from the front,
and thrice from behind.

24
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,490
I don't know what happened in that
room last night, but it sure was brutal.

25
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,740
An extra edition! Extra! Extra!

26
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,830
Who the hell did it?! I'm not
gonna let him get away with it!

27
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,370
How dare you, Straw Hat Luffy?!

28
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,710
So you did this as retaliation for my
stealing your 200 million Berries?

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,260
I won't forgive him.

30
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,970
Come now, don't be shy, ask me my name!

31
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,560
Show yourself, Straw Hat!

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:56,570
"Gum-Gum Human vs. Fire-breathing Cyborg"

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,410
Show yourself, Straw Hat!

34
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,340
You must be here, Straw Hat Luffy!

35
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,090
What the heck? That perv called my name.

36
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,470
Didn't people call him Franky just now?

37
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,300
So he is...

38
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,270
He is the one who beat up Usopp!

39
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,230
This money is already ours.

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,240
Give it... back to me...

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,370
Give it back to me!

42
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,750
He is...

43
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,750
Luffy?

44
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,670
--Hey! Bikini guy!
--Hey, Luffy!

45
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,640
Huh?

46
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm Luffy!

47
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,650
There's no information available?

48
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,770
What's going on?

49
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,610
Everyone...

50
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,570
Kalifa...

51
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,450
Please enter the room... quietly.

52
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,960
What...? Then...

53
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,790
Iceberg-san has...

54
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,250
...just regained consciousness.

55
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,960
Good!

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,430
That's excellent news!

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,390
Iceberg-san!

58
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,560
Well... sorry for making you worry.

59
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,390
In any case, I'm glad you're alive!

60
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,980
Please focus on resting up.

61
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,860
We'll take care of the stuff at the shipyard.

62
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,490
By the way, about the culprits that
broke into my room last night...

63
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,200
Er... they're still investigating.

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,780
Well, I remember it.

65
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,540
--What?
--What?

66
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,340
There were two. One was
a big man with a mask on.

67
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,050
The other was...

68
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,470
...a tall woman with long, black hair.

69
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,850
There's no mistake about it.
Those black eyes belong to...

70
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,860
"He regained consciousness"

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,570
Iceberg-san...

72
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,910
Iceberg-san regained consciousness!

73
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,330
--Is that true?!
--All right!

74
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,540
--Good!
--All right!

75
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,920
So you are... Straw Hat Luffy?

76
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,430
You went on quite the rampage
while I was gone, didn't you?

77
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,390
When I got back, I couldn't believe my eyes.

78
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,480
Well, my house is totally unrecognizable.

79
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,360
How dare you also treat
my underlings so badly?

80
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,700
I can't take it anymore.

81
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,830
No one can stop me this week!

82
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,210
No matter what you say,
until I tear you up like rags,

83
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,750
my anger won't subside!

84
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,420
--Hey, you!
--Hm?

85
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,130
What'd you do with our money?!
The 200 million Berries?!

86
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,760
Give it back to us!

87
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Huh?! 200 million Berries?!

88
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,270
I've already spent it! It's completely gone!

89
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,440
Don't get all uppity and try to protect

90
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,480
the money you stole from
somewhere! You're just pirates!

91
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,690
--It doesn't matter.
--Hm?

92
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,240
Not true! Money does matter!

93
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,410
At any rate, I won't be
happy until I beat you up!

94
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,950
Hmph.

95
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,330
It's me who won't be happy, you bastard!

96
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,580
Hey! Come down here already!

97
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,670
Whoa! This is it! Franky is
gonna start going on a rampage!

98
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,710
Evacuate! Everyone, evacuate!

99
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,670
Get out of here!

100
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,600
What's he doing?

101
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,090
He shot fire out of his mouth!

102
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,760
What is he?!

103
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,550
You've never seen anyone who
shoots fire out of their mouth?

104
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,100
Hey, he might have Devil Fruit powers.

105
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,520
Then, what fruit?

106
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,570
What's with him? He jumped into the water!

107
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,990
Is he an idiot? If he ate a
Devil Fruit, he'll drown and die!

108
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,410
I bet he slipped and fell.
He must have fire-breathing powers!

109
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,060
What the heck?! He can swim?!

110
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,470
Nooo!

111
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,230
I didn't eat any Devil Fruit!

112
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,070
Gum-Gum...

113
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,030
I've heard about your power.

114
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,620
Strong Right!

115
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,260
What the...?

116
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,900
Luffy!

117
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,120
Luffy! Luffy!

118
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,000
What...? What was that?

119
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,010
Oh...? You guys didn't know?

120
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,840
Well then, I'll tell you...

121
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,930
I'm a modified human... A cyborg!

122
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,190
One of the Straw Hats, you say?

123
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,320
Is that true?

124
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,330
Yes. My own investigation
led to the same culprit.

125
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,700
I just had Lucci confirm it
with the government. Then...

126
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,170
Coo coo! Yeah... When I
contacted the government,

127
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,460
they said that she's one
of the Straw Hats. Coo coo!

128
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:09,230
Then... they, the Straw Hats, are the culprits.

129
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,400
What the hell?! Did they do it to get back
at us since we wouldn't fix their ship?!

130
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,070
Hard to say.

131
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,650
But no matter the reason,
the truth is that they did it.

132
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,120
We can ask them the reason
after we tie them up.

133
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,580
I don't know what you have to say,

134
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,040
but you'll pay for this, Straw Hat!

135
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,600
Keep your eyes peeled for
Robin-chan, Chopper. Hm?

136
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,600
Yeah...

137
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,610
Say, Sanji...

138
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,530
--Hm?
--Um...

139
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,570
Aqua Laguna must be pretty crazy, huh?

140
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,580
Yeah. They say that the town gets submerged.

141
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,370
There might be someone who doesn't
know such a storm surge is coming, huh?

142
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,290
Well, probably...

143
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,960
For example, his ship might
get damaged quite a bit, huh?

144
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,920
Well, I mean...

145
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,930
--Say, Sanji--
--Chopper...

146
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,770
Come to think of it, you said you
forgot something at the Merry, right?

147
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,480
What?

148
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,520
You said that, didn't you?

149
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,900
Yeah.

150
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,860
Then... we can't help it.

151
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,370
Just wait, whatever it is I left!

152
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,230
Hey! There's trouble!

153
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,520
You're too loud, Tilestone!

154
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,690
How rude! You all be quiet!

155
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,900
Oh, Iceberg-san! I'm really
glad that you came around!

156
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,830
You speak each and every word too loud!

157
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,540
That isn't good for him, right?!

158
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,870
Yeah! You're right! I'm sorry!

159
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,250
Oh, that's right! There's trouble!
Listen, you guys!

160
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,800
Don't come inside the room.
Speak from where you are.

161
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:50,260
At Dock #1, the pirate Straw Hat,
who came yesterday,

162
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,220
started a fight with Franky
and they're wrecking the shipyard!

163
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,650
Straw Hat...

164
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,230
Iceberg-san!

165
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,950
That bastard...! How dare he just
show up at the Dock like that...?

166
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,250
Please get some rest, Iceberg-san.

167
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,830
I'll be here by your side, so...

168
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,220
...Pistol!

169
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,270
Watch out! It's coming down!

170
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,440
The ship is breaking down!

171
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,650
Stop it! This fight is crazy!

172
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,910
Luffy! Beat up that bikini bastard!

173
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,790
Bro!

174
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,870
Fight!

175
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,760
Anyway, I'm gonna... beat you up!

176
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,180
Go ahead if you can!
Your attacks don't work on me!

177
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,700
Weapons Left!

178
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,160
Gum-Gum... Whip!

179
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,010
What the heck?! What happened?!

180
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,010
Ah! That's...!

181
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,010
Who was that?!

182
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,820
How dare you pull all this crap?
What's your goal, Straw Hat?!

183
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,370
Galley-La... What do you want?

184
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,330
It's the foremen from Dock #1!

185
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,100
All right! The foremen are finally here!

186
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,890
That was close! The shipyard
almost got destroyed!

187
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,560
Good! They're the shipwrights
we met yesterday!

188
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,900
They're on our side, right?

189
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,110
Hey, hey, guys from Galley-La!

190
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,530
You shouldn't butt into our fight!

191
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,410
Do you wanna get hurt?

192
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,780
It's amazing you say that.

193
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,240
After you messed up our factory this much,

194
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,410
we don't even need a reason to come stop you!

195
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,040
He's right, Franky! How are
you gonna settle this?!

196
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,760
Hold on a sec, Tilestone.
We'll talk about it later.

197
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,890
We have more important business right now.

198
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,560
Right, Straw Hat Luffy?

199
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,430
You know what I'm talking about, right?

200
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,270
I'm surprised that you
could show your face again.

201
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,320
What? Why? We came here because
we heard the news about pops.

202
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,530
Geez... Our family wasn't enough,
so you messed with Galley-La, too?

203
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,790
Are you guys all going through puberty,
hurting everyone you come across?

204
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,410
Like I said, we didn't do anything!

205
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,330
If you play innocent, then we'll
just put the screws on you.

206
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,550
Rope Action Half Knot!

207
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,470
I can't breathe... I can't breathe...

208
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
Air... Drive!

209
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,060
You bastards! I said don't
interfere! Don't you get it?!

210
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,320
I'm the one who holds the grudge against him!

211
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,320
Coo coo!

212
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,240
Beat them up, Galley-La Company!

213
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,910
The company's strongest five are fighting!

214
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,290
What? What? Why are the
shipwrights fighting against us, too?!

215
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,120
Itching, itching...

216
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,760
Hey! Wait! I don't have the
slightest reason to fight you guys!

217
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,180
He's... got Devil Fruit powers?

218
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,650
Hey, you bastards, are you listening?!

219
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,280
I said...

220
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,410
...he's my prey!

221
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,380
Hm?

222
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,840
We don't have time to play with you, Franky!

223
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,430
What'd you say, you wild monkey?!

224
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,970
The one who's interfering here is you, Franky!

225
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,230
That's our Tilestone!
He's super strong, as always!

226
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,410
Coo coo! Coo coo!

227
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,750
You jerk...! Stop it!

228
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,230
These guys are really strong...

229
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,770
Dammit! What's with you guys?!
Tell me the reason at least!

230
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,280
Straw Hat... We're the ones
who'd like to know why.

231
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:34,080
The culprits who broke in to our main office
last night and attacked Iceberg-san...

232
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,460
...were from your gang, weren't they?!

233
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Can't be... This can't be...

234
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,590
They butted into my fight.

235
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,410
That was... without a doubt, Nico Robin.

236
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,710
Is that big guy next to her
also one of the Straw Hats?

237
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,830
Why did they attack me in the first place?

238
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,130
It's hard to think that they
did it as payback for yesterday.

239
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,340
They must really be after one of my possessions.

240
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,720
Then, are those pirates
connected to the government?

241
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,350
Or are they after "that" on their own?

242
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,310
Straw Hat...

243
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,060
News flash! News flash!

244
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,440
From what Iceberg-san said,
the culprits have been identified!

245
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,940
What?! Is that true?!

246
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,530
Let's let the entire town know
immediately and corner the culprits!

247
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,410
Don't let them leave Water Seven!

248
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,040
Capture the culprits!

249
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,040
The culprits who attacked Mr. Iceberg are...

250
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,590
...the Straw Hat Pirates!

251
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

252
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

253
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

254
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

255
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

256
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

257
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

258
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

259
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

260
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

261
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

262
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

263
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

264
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

265
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

266
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

267
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

268
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,050
You bastard! How dare you hurt Iceberg-san?!

269
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,800
Like I said, we didn't do anything!

270
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,260
Hey! Don't ignore me!

271
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,590
Now that it's come to this,
we just have to ask pops in person.

272
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,640
--I won't let you go!
--Hold it! What about our fight?!

273
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,230
Don't interfere, Franky! I guess I've got
no choice. I'll just beat you both up!

274
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

275
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,360
"The Straw Hat Pirates Are the Culprits?
The Protectors of the City of Water"

276
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
