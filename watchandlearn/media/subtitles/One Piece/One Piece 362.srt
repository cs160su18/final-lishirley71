2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,050
Ow, ow, ow...

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,850
What's the hold-up?

49
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,270
Weren't you going to kick my
butt as many times as it takes?

50
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,060
Yeah! I will in just a sec, so hang tight!

51
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,110
Well, I don't mind the wait,
but he'll come back if you don't hurry.

52
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,620
"He"? Who are you talking about?

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
You!

54
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,660
That's right. I don't have
time to be goofing off.

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,050
I need to hurry back.

56
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,090
Oh, jeez. You're such a handful.

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,510
Don't! Robin is a lady!

58
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,220
A lady...?

59
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,350
What of it?!

60
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,840
Robin!

61
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,650
Unbelievable! Sanji actually kicked...

62
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,030
Golden...

63
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,160
No!

64
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,520
...Pound!

65
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,210
Sleep till dawn!

66
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,270
Didn't that samurai just say something?

67
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,430
Long story short, what just happened?

68
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,930
In short, the fight is apparently over.

69
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,040
I've never seen a duel like this before.

70
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,960
That samurai wasn't taking me
the least bit seriously!

71
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,640
"Slashes Dancing on the Rooftop!!
Showdown: Zoro vs. Ryuma!"

72
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,020
You think that you can steal
my black sword, Shusui?

73
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,070
To be precise, I'm going to take
the sword from beside your corpse.

74
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,500
I see. You are full of spirit!

75
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,790
I wouldn't provoke him if I were you...

76
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,670
I see you also carry three swords.

77
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,590
Yeah, but one is a broken blade.

78
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,510
I just carry it at my waist because
it doesn't feel right without it.

79
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,390
I'm a Three-Sword Style swordsman.

80
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,010
A Three-Sword Style swordsman?
I've never heard of such a thing.

81
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,380
Is it a circus act?

82
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,150
It's a pity I can't let you
see it in action right now.

83
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,110
I'd break that squat nose of yours!

84
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,880
I'm sure. You seem quite strong.

85
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,240
Emotions beyond my
recollection are surfacing.

86
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,910
I feel as though I am standing
face to face with a giant beast.

87
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,370
It is a strange, exhilarating sensation!

88
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,340
I feel as though I could start dancing.

89
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,300
What a shock!

90
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,190
Aubade Coup Droit!

91
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,530
H-He used a pistol?!

92
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,780
I-It was a thrust!

93
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,280
If I used that move,
it wouldn't be as impressive!

94
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,880
He shot a hole through the wall!

95
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,590
To shoot a thrust like that...
Just how strong is he?!

96
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,050
I'd say it's a draw.

97
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,220
Yep.

98
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,790
You nearly got me.

99
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,800
What the heck?!

100
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,110
When did that
Haramaki freak get in a counter attack?!

101
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,780
The attacks... were nearly simultaneous.

102
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,910
So he can throw his attacks as well.

103
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,740
The skirmish between them
just now truly did end in a draw.

104
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,500
The samurai zombie is currently
using my shadow to move,

105
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,630
but the samurai was probably an expert
swordsman when he was still alive.

106
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:54,010
I believe those two may possess
the same type of build as swordsmen.

107
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,800
Does it mean anything if
they share the same build?

108
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,430
It means their strengths
lie in the same areas.

109
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,970
I doubt this duel will last long.

110
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,820
Prelude Au Fer!

111
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,970
A sword-breaker assault?!

112
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,470
Two-Sword Style... Flash!

113
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,300
Demon Magma Bear!

114
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,480
Gavotte Bond en Avant!

115
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,190
Two-Sword Style Sword Draw...

116
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,900
...Rashomon!

117
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,130
He blocked my attack!

118
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,880
They slashed through the support beams!

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,390
Oh, crud! This floor is toast!
It's dangerous up here!

120
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,860
Man, hang on! We're gettin' outta here.

121
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,320
The whole roof's comin' down!

122
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,410
Seventy-two Pound Phoenix!

123
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,420
Polka Remise!

124
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,850
Weapons Left!

125
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,270
Dang, that was close!

126
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,050
Careful! You don't want to fall!

127
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,490
Falling...!

128
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,220
How can they fight with such poor footing...?

129
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,220
I'm afraid my swords will break
if this drags out much longer.

130
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,770
He truly has the body and
spirit needed to support the

131
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,270
strength of a legendary swordsman.

132
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,590
One-Sword Style!

133
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,130
Soaring Dragon...

134
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,470
Three-Pace Hum...

135
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,060
...Notch Slash!

136
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,480
...Blaze!

137
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,340
My wound is bursting into flames!

138
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,770
I have lost.

139
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:13,220
Once, a legendary samurai
wielded the great sword Shusui.

140
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,600
I am sure this katana would be
happy to have you as its master.

141
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,060
Didn't that samurai just say something?

142
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,530
Long story short, what just happened?

143
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,110
In short, the fight is apparently over.

144
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,950
I've never seen a duel like this before.

145
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:41,290
That samurai wasn't taking
me the least bit seriously!

146
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,270
Hey, Skeleton! What do you mean it's "over"?

147
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,490
It was an incredible duel...

148
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:33,090
It pains my samurai heart
that I must taste defeat...

149
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,760
The fact that you feel ashamed proves...

150
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,480
...that you are a swordsman
in both mind and body!

151
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,690
I wish we could have met
when you were still alive.

152
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,870
I-Isn't that...?

153
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,200
It sure is! It's my shadow,
which Moria snatched away

154
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,930
from me five years ago!

155
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,040
Look! It's copying whatever I do!

156
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,880
Isn't that a given? It's your shadow.

157
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:18,800
This might be hard for you to understand,
but I'm finally my old self again!

158
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,020
I'm touched! I'm moved!

159
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,460
These emotions are coursing through my veins!

160
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,350
Ah, not that I have any veins.

161
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,800
I guess they go "bone deep."

162
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,030
It's back! After five years,
I have a shadow again!

163
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,790
I'll take your sword, but I'll pretend
that our duel never happened...

164
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,460
...samurai of the Wano Kingdom!

165
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I wonder if Sanji has already
found and rescued Nami.

166
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,810
And how are Luffy and the others doing?

167
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,810
At any rate, I've just gotta tell
everyone about how I beat

168
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:10,730
that Horo-Horo Chick when they
didn't stand a chance against her!

169
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,740
I can't wait to see their faces!

170
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,270
Perona-sama!

171
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,450
Do you think she's okay?

172
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,210
Of course! Captain Kumacy and Lieutenant
Gentleman Hippopotamus went after her!

173
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,380
By now, Mr. Negative Nose
is the one crying like a baby!

174
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,290
Phew, that was a close call!

175
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,850
All of my hard work would go down
the drain if I got taken down now.

176
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,390
There'd go my bragging rights.

177
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,770
Moving on! Sanji! Guys!

178
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,900
What happened here...?

179
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,030
Weren't they supposed to be
attending Absalom-sama's wedding?

180
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,350
The Special Zombie did this to them.

181
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,120
Absalom-sama ordered them
to forcibly stop Oars,

182
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,880
but he took them out in the blink of an eye.

183
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,090
Absurd! Even though he's a
Special Zombie, he's still a zombie!

184
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,720
Why would he attack his comrades?

185
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,760
Oars is rather new to his life as a zombie.

186
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,510
Apparently he still has
Straw Hat's personality.

187
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,230
Awesome! This is a ship?

188
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,740
All righty! With this ship,
I'm gonna become King of the Pirates!

189
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,990
Gum-Gum...

190
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,990
Actually, I'm not made of rubber.

191
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,700
Gatling!

192
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,170
Don't get in the way of my adventure!

193
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:10,600
I suspect it will take a while for him
to become an obedient zombie...

194
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,110
Wh-What?! He took out all of these
General Zombies in an instant?

195
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,480
That's right.

196
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,030
They must have let their guard down!

197
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,200
Otherwise this never would have happened.

198
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,540
If I were you, I'd start running!

199
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,290
Otherwise, Oars will do you in as well!

200
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,710
Silence, Hildon! Are you mocking us?!

201
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,550
The monster! How dare he kill our comrades?!

202
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,600
Since Absalom-sama gave those orders,

203
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,430
no one will mind if we
teach him a thing or two!

204
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,230
I swear by our title as the strongest

205
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,560
that we will let Oars know just how
powerful the General Zombies are!

206
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,210
--Ch-Charge!
--Yeah!

207
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,260
Don't get in my way!

208
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,180
Gum-Gum...

209
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:43,070
Oh, oops! That's right. I'd forgotten!

210
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,860
I need to hurry on back.

211
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,090
What happened to all of that
fire you had earlier, Straw Hat?

212
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,030
Damn it! Don't act so high-and-mighty

213
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,600
when you aren't fighting, Giant Shallot!

214
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,720
I've already told you:

215
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,400
I am the man who will let others
make me the King of the Pirates.

216
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,780
And it looks like the day I realize my
dream has gotten a whole lot closer!

217
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,450
I'll keep taking you down until
I recover all of the shadows!

218
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,410
Like I said, defeating me won't--

219
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,040
When ya get down to it, I just need
to defeat you and this shadow!

220
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,460
Gum-Gum Rocket!

221
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:03,610
I don't care what happens to you,
but as things stand, your future looks bleak.

222
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,560
A more powerful foe will be here
any minute now, you know?

223
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,170
Dr. Chopper, listen. The zombies are happy.

224
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,550
After all, they are given a second
chance to live amongst us as humans!

225
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,470
--You're wrong!
--I'm wrong? Like your medical knowhow--

226
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,020
Shut up! That isn't a medical procedure!

227
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,560
I'll never forgive you!

228
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

229
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,070
"Chopper Is Furious!!
Hogback's Evil Medical Practices!"

230
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
