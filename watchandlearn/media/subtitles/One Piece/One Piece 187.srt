00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,890
While God Eneru was busy dealing
with Sanji's last-ditch efforts...

18
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,360
...Usopp succeeded in rescuing Sanji.

19
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,790
Meanwhile, Luffy's group...

20
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,880
...headed up Giant Jack to
settle the score with God Eneru.

21
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,350
"Gyaaaaa!"

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,910
Robin! Eneru's after the gold bell, right?!

23
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,350
And it's at the top of this vine, right?!

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,610
They had but a mere
moment to enjoy their reunion,

25
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,580
for God Eneru, after repairing
the Maxim, took action again!

26
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,410
Mamaragan.

27
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,730
Everyone! Hurry to the ship!
I'll get Luffy and bring him back!

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
An exquisite view!

29
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,250
Don't assume things are gonna
turn out how you want, Eneru!

30
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,880
Dammit! He isn't holding back!
We gotta get outta here!

31
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,800
Everything's done for!

32
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:50,500
Is that where the detestable
Shandoran warriors' hidden village is?

33
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,960
They're originally from the Blue Sea;
surely they'd enjoy going home!

34
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,510
Now, then! Strike the world below!

35
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,050
Our village!

36
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,710
That was close! We'd be ashes
now had we left any later!

37
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,230
In the name of Great Warrior Calgara...

38
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,600
...light the fire of Shandora!

39
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,900
Wyper.

40
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,860
Your distant ancestor,
Great Warrior Calgara,

41
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,680
had another reason for being so
determined to take back our homeland.

42
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,640
Another reason?

43
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,950
Yes. It was Calgara's greatest regret of all.

44
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,150
Listen. Great Warrior Calgara
had a very close friend...

45
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,480
A close friend?

46
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,160
Yes. He met Calgara 400
years ago. His name was...

47
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,320
...Montblanc Noland!

48
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,370
"Led by a Bell's Sound! Tale of
the Great Warrior and the Explorer"

49
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:48,160
This tale took place 400 years ago,
and though it has never been written of,

50
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,530
it has been kept in people's hearts
from one generation to the next.

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,400
It is a true story of a
warrior known as a monster,

52
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,460
and an adventurer known as a liar.

53
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,160
Get on board, quick!

54
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,510
The Monster of Shandora is coming!

55
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,470
Hurry! Cast off! Cast off!

56
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,000
B-But there are still crewmen--!

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,690
Just get us out to sea!

58
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,190
He's here!

59
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,030
You must be eliminated!

60
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,150
Leave all your belongings and go!

61
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,460
R-Reporting, Commodore!

62
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,660
Our ship's stores have
finally been exhausted,

63
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,120
meaning we're now... lost... at sea...

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,750
The cook's fainted!

65
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,550
Dammit! There's no food left!

66
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,470
The commodore fell into the ocean!

67
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,640
This is the Grand Line! Did he decide
to drown himself and leave us?!

68
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,500
Maybe he was so starved he chose death?

69
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,890
Don't be stupid! He's a hero who's
returned twice from these waters!

70
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,340
Then what're these carefully
folded clothes and shoes for?!

71
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,200
H-Hey! Someone go check...

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,140
Screw that! It's a sea
of monsters down there!

73
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,330
He's not coming back up!

74
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,850
Commodore!

75
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,010
Pretty nimble guy, he was. Here.

76
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,890
Eh? What's this rope?

77
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,620
Pull it in.

78
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,030
What is this, Commodore?!

79
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,280
Don't tell us you killed it underwater?!

80
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,540
Cook it up for us.

81
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,340
You really do lose your
touch when you get lazy.

82
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,710
It's a huge storm, Commodore!

83
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,970
I bet so, given this swaying.

84
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,240
You bet so? Is that all?!

85
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,060
The yardarm's been busted!

86
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,080
--Where?!
--Main! Main!

87
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,320
This third voyage has lasted over two years.

88
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,180
It's almost miraculous it has lasted so long.

89
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,750
Hey. Did you just hear something?!

90
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,860
Eh? Do you mean the thunder?

91
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,890
No, something beautiful, like a bell...

92
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,900
Priest! Try to keep your senses!

93
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,920
This land is cursed! At this rate,
the Shandians will be wiped out!

94
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,840
H-How can we save the village, Priest?!

95
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,970
O-Offer... a girl!

96
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,710
At the sacrificial altar!

97
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,600
How many victims does that make?

98
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,170
Over a hundred...

99
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,410
What's going on?! This has
never happened to us before!

100
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,880
If I can be of use, I
will gladly give my life.

101
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,970
Why do you cry, Mom?

102
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,170
I'm about to be welcomed by the sun god!

103
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,440
Being chosen to be a sacrifice
is a wonderful thing!

104
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,170
Thank you for raising me, Mom.

105
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,340
Mousse!

106
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,580
If this is a bad dream, let me wake up!

107
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,830
Dammit! Go away!

108
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,920
Go away!

109
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,050
Great Warrior Calgara...

110
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,490
Seto...

111
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,340
I wanted to be like you someday...

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,880
I wanted to be a brave warrior
and fight to protect this land!

113
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,150
I don't wanna die because
of something like this!

114
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,340
You're amazing, Commodore!

115
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,090
There really was an island in
the direction you said to turn to!

116
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,900
Yes, what a relief. We can
ride out the storm here.

117
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,660
Still, did you guys really not hear it?

118
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,930
Nope. None of us heard any bells. Right?

119
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,300
Yeah! You must've been
hearing things, Commodore!

120
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,390
What a magnificent forest!

121
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,150
I hope we find good research materials!

122
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,090
Commodore! Was that the sound you heard?!

123
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,650
Hey, now! Don't tease me!

124
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,280
I'd never mistake the sounds of
this odd bird for something else!

125
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,590
C-Commodore! Was this--

126
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,980
Wow... What a beautiful tone...

127
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,280
Seems there are people here!

128
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,400
H-Hold on, Commodore! Wait!

129
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,850
Someone's lying on the ground!

130
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,720
Damn it... Intruders!

131
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,050
Hey! Kid!

132
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,910
Commodore! This kid doesn't look right!

133
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,800
Wait, you!

134
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,130
Let go!

135
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,100
It's the Kinetsu plague.
He hasn't been treated at all.

136
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,340
T-This island is bad news!

137
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,950
Doctor! Do we have any Conine left?!

138
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,940
Inject this lad and all of us immediately!

139
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,960
This is bad. Even the crops
are being eaten away at...

140
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,610
Commodore! All the houses
are filled with the sick!

141
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,460
Take the girl to the altar!

142
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,280
God of the sun... God of the rain...

143
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,270
God of the forest... God of the earth...

144
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:53,200
In exchange for this girl's life,
please save our village!

145
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,360
It's the Kashi God!

146
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,350
Mousse!

147
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,130
Let her go! It's for the village!

148
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,660
The Kashi God has such a divine form!

149
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,690
Please save my mother!

150
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,320
Please save my son and father!

151
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,010
What the--?! Something fell!

152
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,120
What's that?!

153
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,960
What on earth?! Who is that?!

154
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,870
Kashi God!

155
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,280
God-killer!

156
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,920
The ceremony is over.

157
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,970
You must've been really frightened.

158
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,210
You're safe now! There's no need to die!

159
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,320
Kashi God! Please forgive us!

160
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,190
We're all going to be cursed!

161
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,640
Kill! Give more lives to the gods!
Before we incur their wrath!

162
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,890
Calgara! Kill him!

163
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,890
Sounds like he did something bad!

164
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,650
They're really freaking out!

165
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,450
He doesn't know how to ignore!

166
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,320
He killed a god? What's that mean?!

167
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,470
Tribal rituals ain't something
you mess around with!

168
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,110
Quell the gods' anger,
Great Warrior Calgara-sama!

169
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,500
I am an explorer from
the North Blue, Montblanc--

170
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,250
It doesn't matter who you are!
You must be eliminated!

171
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,250
Is this how you've eliminated all
the few, yet vital advancements?!

172
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,050
You're in no place to criticize!
Atone to the gods where you stand!

173
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,400
Who is that man?! He's holding
his own against Calgara!

174
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,410
There! Use that knife to take your life!

175
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,770
What?!

176
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,380
A sacrifice meant to save the village,
crying because she wants to live...

177
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,370
Have you no shame?!

178
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,880
Don't be a fool!

179
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,040
Stop!

180
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,650
C-Commodore!

181
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,890
For centuries we've strictly
upheld the commandment

182
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,890
that all intruders on this
island must be punished!

183
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,990
What's more, you're a god-killer!
You, alone, won't be enough!

184
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,100
You and all your men will
pay with your lives!

185
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:18,970
"Lives" this, "sacrifices" that!
Will those make your gods happy?!

186
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,940
These ceremonies are flat-out denials

187
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,860
of the triumphs of all the great men
before us! I won't stand for it!

188
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,920
This is an insult to all the
adventurers and researchers

189
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,060
who've ever set out to sea in the
hopes of bringing people happiness!

190
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,260
If your gods value people's lives,

191
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,360
then wouldn't they have contempt
for these ceremonies, too?!

192
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,300
Give me time!

193
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,400
I'll banish this so-called curse of yours!

194
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,010
And if I can't, you can do whatever you like!

195
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,170
What nonsense!

196
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,820
You think you're a god or something?!

197
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,430
In return, if I do save
this village from tragedy,

198
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,200
swear to me you'll never
hold these ceremonies again!

199
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,700
Is that all you have to say?!

200
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,000
Such nonsense! Now you die!

201
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,410
Try it!

202
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,980
Eh?!

203
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,120
What are you saying?!

204
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,870
These people have until
tomorrow evening to live.

205
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,500
Perfect!

206
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,650
It's "goodbye, world" come sunset tomorrow!

207
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,010
Have faith in the commodore!

208
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,870
Hey, girlie. I feel bad for you too;
you were born in this village...

209
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,830
Yeah! With your looks,
you could marry an aristocrat!

210
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,070
Knock it off, guys! Don't you have any tact?!

211
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,710
Who is he?

212
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,580
Oh, you mean the commodore?

213
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,440
He's Montblanc Noland,
a renowned explorer. And a botanist.

214
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,530
He visits uncharted islands and finds
and researches new plants there.

215
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,470
He's pretty much a hero back home.

216
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,780
But he's too good-natured...

217
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,320
And his biggest flaw is that
he can't ignore stuff like this!

218
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,190
We do trust him, though!

219
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,510
Why didn't you let Calgara kill him there?!

220
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,470
The answer will make itself known tomorrow.

221
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,420
He says he can save our village.
There is no harm in waiting.

222
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,070
How can you be so carefree?!

223
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,860
You'll listen to him, but not
the priest's last words?!

224
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,610
Calgara! Say something!

225
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,340
If I sense the village is in
even the slightest danger,

226
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,650
I'll take that man's head without
waiting for tomorrow's sun to set.

227
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,260
I do not have the power
to hear the gods' voices.

228
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:05,990
But I do know when a man is
speaking earnest words. That is all.

229
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,230
Should you really be up?

230
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,060
I'm all better...

231
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,630
Great Warrior Calgara...

232
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,530
What does "advancement" mean?

233
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,350
Here we are! A Cona tree!

234
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,910
I'd be surprised if there wasn't
one in such a big forest!

235
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,500
Earthquake!

236
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,030
It's happening! It's really happening!

237
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,930
It's the Kashi God's curse!

238
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,060
Let us out of here!

239
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,970
This is bad... The forest floor has sunk...

240
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,720
It looks like the island
is about to tear apart!

241
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,510
Looking good!

242
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,970
Seems the gods have given a
crushing blow to you directly!

243
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,410
In that case, these gods...
aren't that great... at all...

244
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,870
They don't even have the strength...
to kill a single person...

245
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,480
You're stubborn.

246
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:54,230
Sorry, but could you get lost?
I don't feel like looking at you!

247
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,920
I... must hurry to the village!

248
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,530
Amusing. I think I'll see this through.

249
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,490
Just try and squirm out!

250
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

251
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

252
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

253
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

254
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

255
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

256
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

257
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

258
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,010
How unsightly! Is this the wreck
of a man who defied the gods?!

259
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,340
Will your village die by
curse, or by disease?!

260
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,110
Are you that afraid of your gods?!

261
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,220
Don't talk like you understand!

262
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,180
However great your gods are,
people's lives are even more precious!

263
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,450
On the next episode of One Piece!

264
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,640
"Free from the Spell!
The Great Warrior Sheds Tears!!"

265
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,740
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
