2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,780
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,480
Luffy was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,160
There is, however, an untold
story of the brothers...

62
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,540
...10 years ago in the East
Blue - Luffy and Ace as boys.

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,960
"To Live Up to the Promise!
Departures of Their Own!"

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,080
Late in the day

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,180
on which the Celestial Dragon's
ship arrived at the Goa Kingdom,

66
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,400
at a small village somewhere
in the East Blue...

67
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,430
Did you see the person with
the gigantic face today?

68
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,500
Yeah, I've never seen someone like that!

69
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,730
Look, the ship is huge, too!

70
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,220
580... 581...

71
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,430
582... 583...

72
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,390
584...

73
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,810
You're late, Dragon! I got tired of waiting!

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,270
Sorry.

75
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,780
What happened?!

76
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,030
--Oh, that's very bad!
--Hey, treat him now!

77
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,230
Roger!

78
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,010
Honestly! Where have you been?!

79
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,210
I was watching the ceremony
for the Celestial Dragon.

80
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,590
How could you do that without telling me?

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,050
You attract too much attention.

82
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,220
M-My face, you mean?

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,610
We have to prepare as soon as
possible for what will come!

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,110
Do we have enough food?

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
They gave us some at the
training hall in the village.

86
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,010
Let's leave here! Head back to Baltigo!

87
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,150
Meanwhile, in the Goa Kingdom

88
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,880
after the observers from the
World Government left...

89
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,600
Here comes some junk!

90
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,810
People are doing exactly the
same thing they did before

91
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,810
accumulating another mountain of junk.

92
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,570
Here I come, Ace!

93
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,740
Gum-Gum...

94
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,740
...Pistol!

95
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,050
What are you doing?! You're no match for me!

96
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,200
No matter how strong you are,

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,520
it's nothing if you can't hit a target!

98
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,770
Rubber is not useful in
fighting just as I thought!

99
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,810
Shut up!

100
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,530
What?! I'm telling you the truth!

101
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,860
All you can do is bounce back
attacks  and sink like a rock!

102
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,070
Stop making fun of the Gum-Gum
Fruit! I'll make you cry someday!

103
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,910
I've been creating new attacks
stronger than the pistol!

104
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,790
Luffy, that was great!

105
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,830
Your arm stretched farther than yesterday!

106
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,460
Sabo! You're too easy on Luffy!

107
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,510
I'm stronger than yesterday as I thought!

108
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,680
--Don't you think so, Sabo?!
--Don't you think so, Sabo?!

109
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,570
Sabo was a good brother...

110
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,320
What?! You mean it'd be
better if I had died?!

111
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,450
I didn't say that!

112
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,700
You meant it!

113
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,280
Ouch!

114
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,670
Sabo didn't hit me like that!

115
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,520
--What?!
--What?! Be nice to me!

116
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,620
No way!

117
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,180
Ouch.

118
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,690
I HEREBY ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY

119
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,690
I hereby establish an independent country.

120
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,290
Country?!

121
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,910
ME TOO

122
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,910
Me too!

123
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,790
ACE'S KINGDOM--

124
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,620
LUFFY'S KINGDOM

125
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,420
ACE'S KINGDOM    LUFFY'S KINGDOM

126
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,420
What do you want this time?

127
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,080
We need to be strong enough
to live on our own!

128
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,840
You guys belong to Dadan's Kingdom!

129
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,680
Let me use your bath sometimes.

130
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,080
Ace! You gotta help me! It's a bear!

131
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,460
I thought that you wanted
to live on your own.

132
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,500
Dammit!

133
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,680
Luffy!

134
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,340
Hey, anybody there in Dadan's Kingdom?!

135
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,480
Luffy got hurt! Please help him!

136
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,120
Magra! Please! Treat Luffy!

137
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,580
Okay, okay, come in now!

138
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,970
Well, well, it was no joking matter.

139
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,180
He might have died if the
cut was a little bit deeper.

140
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,480
You three fought those beasts
together, didn't you?

141
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,190
It's my fault!

142
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,120
I knew it doesn't prove that you're
strong by fighting on your own!

143
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,250
I'm not good enough!

144
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm not good enough at all!

145
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,250
Ace...

146
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,750
I'm sorry, Luffy!

147
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,680
I'm sorry!

148
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,560
Hey, guys!

149
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,730
Makino came all the way bringing us sake!

150
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,440
How to pay respect to other people?

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,280
Uh-huh.

152
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,350
What's gotten into you?

153
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,880
Since I'm Luffy's brother,

154
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,740
it's my job to go see the captain
of the Red-Haired Pirates

155
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,560
who helped Luffy in order to thank him!

156
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,430
Do you have something to say?!

157
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm sorry. Alright, I'll teach you how.

158
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,600
Okay, this would be the first one...

159
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,080
They didn't pay!

160
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,860
Stop!

161
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,590
Oh, we forgot to do it!

162
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,990
Oh yeah!

163
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,060
--Thank you for the meal!
--Thank you for the meal!

164
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,200
Shut up, you brats! You got to pay!

165
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,340
I'm gonna win today!

166
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,910
--We did it!
--We did it!

167
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,840
Bear meat stew tonight!

168
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,900
7 YEARS LATER

169
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,690
ACE, 17 YEARS OLD

170
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,030
LUFFY, 14 YEARS OLD

171
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,810
Take care, Ace!

172
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,730
Yeah. See you, Luffy! I'm going now!

173
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:46,150
Uh-huh! I'll be a lot stronger
when I leave here in 3 years!

174
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,710
Good luck, Ace!

175
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,400
Take care!

176
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,410
Don't catch a cold!

177
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,960
You just wait! I'll make my name soon!

178
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,590
Ace, the son of the King of the
Pirates, has grown up secretly

179
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,600
and he quietly departed from
the shore nearby Mt. Corvo.

180
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,610
He's gone!

181
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,990
Honestly! I wonder what Garp would say.

182
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,510
You must raise him, Dadan!

183
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,770
No way! Whose baby is this?

184
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,560
Boss!

185
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,360
Ace is gone!

186
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,010
Oh good. But I can see that
Garp will be mad at me.

187
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,720
He was such an useless little shit!

188
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,580
Oh, Ace left a message for you.

189
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,290
What?! He still has something to
say to me even at the last minute?!

190
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,330
He said "Thank you for taking care of me!"

191
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,430
He can't do that! That fool!

192
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,310
Oh? Boss, are you crying?!

193
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm not crying, you fool!

194
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
I have to wait 3 years more.

195
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,760
Gum-Gum...

196
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,450
...Pistol!

197
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,480
Damn! I missed it by a little.

198
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,730
You almost got it, Luffy!

199
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,380
Why don't you keep the
center of gravity lower?

200
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,390
Gum-Gum...

201
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,810
...Pistol!

202
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,450
I wanna become stronger!

203
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,260
I wanna become stronger!

204
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,160
A FEW MONTHS LATER

205
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,000
Luffy!

206
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,960
Look at the newspaper!

207
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,080
What is it?

208
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,340
Look here!

209
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,300
Wow! Ace made his name!

210
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,770
He got his own ship and crew!

211
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,140
He's great! Ace is great!

212
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,190
But I'm gonna top him!

213
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,320
3 YEARS LATER - LUFFY, 17 YEARS OLD

214
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,200
Hey, guys!

215
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,430
I'm leaving now. You're not gonna see me off?

216
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,540
How annoying.

217
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,030
The mayor and Makino won't mind,

218
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,780
but the people in the Windmill
Village will be scared of us.

219
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,650
But...

220
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,170
Why don't you just go already?!

221
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,880
Alright. Then you guys,

222
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,390
thank you for everything!

223
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,580
Don't say it - I feel awkward!

224
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,310
Well, well, take care!

225
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,710
Yeah, okay!

226
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,980
Oh yeah!

227
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,820
Dadan, I don't like mountain bandits...

228
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,480
Shut up, you brat!

229
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,410
...but I like you guys!

230
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,540
Stop talking nonsense and go
away already, you bastard!

231
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Dammit! Why am I surrounded by such fools?!

232
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh, you crying?

233
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,050
I'm not crying!

234
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,890
Windmill Village at the edge of
Goa Kingdom on the Dawn Island.

235
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,520
Hey, why don't you take my
old fishing boat, Luffy?

236
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,400
That thing is gonna sink any minute!

237
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,100
That's a small boat...

238
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,520
This is fine! This is
what I wanna start with!

239
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,490
Sabo!

240
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,450
Watch over me! I'm gonna go out to sea now!

241
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,830
Sabo was first and Ace was second.

242
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,810
And I'm third but I'm gonna
top them!

243
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,210
Wait for me, Ace!

244
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,070
I'll catch up with you soon!

245
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,000
What are you doing screaming and mumbling?

246
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,190
Is it some kind of incantation?

247
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,960
No, it's not! It's a challenge!

248
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,390
--Who's Ace?
--No idea.

249
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,810
Alright, I'm going now!

250
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,910
He's finally leaving,
mayor. I'm gonna miss him.

251
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,750
It's a dishonor to the
village to become a pirate!

252
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,340
What nice day for setting sail!

253
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,270
Th-That's...!

254
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,190
Here comes our local sea monster!

255
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,710
You don't know who you're messing with.

256
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,080
Look at this technique I've
been training for 10 years!

257
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,180
Gum-Gum...

258
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,170
...Pistol!

259
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,570
That will learn ya, stupid fish!

260
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,080
Wow! He beat the sea monster
with a single blow!

261
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,080
He's become quite strong!

262
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,880
Let's start with finding a crew!

263
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,090
I want at least 10 of them.

264
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,690
And the black flag!

265
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,670
Alright! Let's go!

266
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,430
I'm gonna become...

267
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,450
...the King of the Pirates!

268
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,760
And now,

269
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,780
Luffy mourns the loss of his brother Ace.

270
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,260
Luffy-kun...

271
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,600
The King of the Pirates?!

272
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,100
I'm...

273
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,150
I'm...

274
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,620
I'm...

275
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm too...

276
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,920
...weak!!

277
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,920
As Garp returns to Windmill Village,
Dadan greets him in outrage.

278
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,370
Meanwhile, Luffy is lost in his grief
and helplessness after losing Ace.

279
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,310
As he watches Luffy writhe in despair,

280
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,350
Jimbei recalls the words of Ace...

281
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,830
On the next episode of One Piece!

282
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,900
"I Want to See Them! Luffy's Mournful Cry!"

283
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,380
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
