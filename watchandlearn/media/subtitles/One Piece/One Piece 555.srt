00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

Freedom is our only rule

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,900
It's not our way to worry

60
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,480
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,780
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,160
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,870
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,000
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,540
--We've been waiting for you, Straw Hat!
--H-He really came!

81
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,130
Luffy-sama, what did you just call me?

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,390
You were calling me "Coward
(Yowamushi)" before.

83
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,430
Yeah, it's not like I know everything but
you're not as timid as I thought you were.

84
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,100
So I'll call you Yowahoshi from now on!

85
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,900
All pirates will fall down on their knees
before us--the New Fish-Man Pirates!

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,990
Look at these human pirates with
confidence in their ability to fight!

87
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,870
You will all be like them, Straw Hat!

88
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,300
I'll be the one who becomes
King of the Pirates!

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,590
The King of the Pirates?

90
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,130
We have 100,000 on our side!

91
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,020
Hey, Luffy!

92
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,980
That 400 million berry prize is mine!

93
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,350
No, mine!

94
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,230
No way!

95
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,860
Kill him!

96
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,540
What's going on here?!

97
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,840
He didn't do anything but
so many of us got knocked out!

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,050
You're Hordy, right?
I guess I have to kick your ass.

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,930
You can become king of whatever
you want in any country.

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,850
But there can only be
one King of the Pirates!

101
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:46,860
"Deadly Attacks One After Another!
Zoro and Sanji Join the Battle!"

102
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,030
--Oh, what...
--...Extraordinary power!

103
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,200
So he's the Straw Hat Luffy!

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,510
He's out of our league!

105
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,840
Where do you think you're going?

106
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,720
If you run from your enemy on this historic
day for the Fish-Men, you deserve death.

107
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,430
We may have lost 50,000.

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,310
But...

109
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,320
...we are still 50,000 strong!

110
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,830
The Straw Hats always shatter
our dreams. They're our...

111
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,740
...worst enemy!

112
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,300
And Jimbei!

113
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,180
He lives Otohime's dream
and befriends humans!

114
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,100
But that's not the future we Fish-Men want!

115
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,770
He's right! Straw Hat is nothing!
He's just a human!

116
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,980
And Jimbei betrayed the Fish-Men!
Let's kill them both!

117
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,950
Luffy! I wish you left more
than 50,000 of them for me.

118
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,700
Oh, sorry.

119
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,040
Don't get so excited.

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,870
Huh?

121
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,290
I'll go for 30,000! Okay, Moss Head?

122
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,460
Shut up, Mr. Nosebleed.

123
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Huh?

124
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,970
You audience babies!

125
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,100
Okay! Let me do one song for
the beginning of the battle!

126
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,440
They're not here to see you.

127
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,110
As always, Robin-san's so cool!

128
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,160
They weren't listening at all, were they?

129
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,580
That's because I whispered it!

130
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,960
--What?!
--He has too much pride.

131
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,340
Kill them!

132
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,380
--Let's show them...
--...How great Fish-Men are!

133
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,390
Let's do it!

134
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,310
Third Gear!

135
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,740
I don't care if there're
thousands of you! Just bring it on!

136
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,450
Gum-Gum...

137
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,580
--Here he comes!
--What's wrong with his hand?!

138
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,370
...Giant Pistol!

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,460
All right, let's join him.

140
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,670
That fool didn't wait for us again.

141
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,850
I've got to do this, after seeing
tears in Shirahoshi-chan's eyes.

142
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,390
You must have been trying
so hard to protect...

143
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,060
...that small "sprout"
single-handedly, day after day.

144
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,980
But let us protect it for you this time.

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,950
Men who can't wipe away the tears
from women's eyes aren't real men.

146
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,120
Let's wreck these guys!

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,840
When this is over, let's have a drink
at the Mermaid Cafe, Shirahoshi-chan!

148
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,300
Drop dead!

149
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,890
Collier Shoot!

150
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,980
I won't let you destroy
this Mermaid paradise!

151
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,190
They'll either give up or be wiped out.

152
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,700
108...

153
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,910
...Pound Phoenix!

154
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,630
What are you looking at, woman?!

155
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,430
There are some important historical
resources here on the Fish-Man Island!

156
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,020
You can't just rampage
around destroying things!

157
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,820
Whether it's the citizens
or the kingdom or the history.

158
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,990
Trienta Fleurs...

159
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,740
What's this?!

160
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,860
...Clutch!

161
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,790
They're so excited!

162
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,250
It's a nice day to do a concert!

163
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,010
Everybody say "ho"!

164
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,980
Today's audience is awesome!

165
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,780
I got him!

166
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,530
Kung Fu Boost!

167
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,080
H-He transformed himself!

168
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,790
I don't care how many at
once - just bring it on!

169
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
Th-The racoon shape-shifted!

170
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm not a racoon!

171
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,930
Special Attack--Green Star "Devil"!

172
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,480
It's gonna eat me!

173
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,060
Take this! Green Stars at random!

174
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,900
How's that? I'm a Pop Green master!
People call me Usopp'n-sama!

175
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,950
Huh?

176
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,540
Thanks, Nami!

177
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,420
I thought you got stronger
but some things never change!

178
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,760
Super it's getting
pretty exciting, isn't it?!

179
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,970
There are 50,000 enemies. This is the
perfect opportunity to unveil them!

180
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,890
Them?!

181
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,140
What are they, Franky?!

182
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,190
There are 2 new weapons on the Sunny!

183
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,030
Who wants to ride along?

184
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,440
What?! New weapons?!

185
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,910
--Super! Super! I'm super!
--Hey, hey! What are they?

186
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,030
Can I ride it?

187
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,330
Is it safer to be onboard than out here?

188
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,540
Well, you'll see! You can set
your expectations very high!

189
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,960
You are all amazing!

190
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,760
What are you guys doing?! How pathetic!

191
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,560
Try and save the giant Mermaid...

192
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,060
...in the middle of the plaza,

193
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,810
if you can!

194
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,650
Water Shot!

195
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,620
Oh, I didn't have to worry.

196
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,300
What?!

197
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,620
He deflected Captain Hordy's
destructive Water Shot...

198
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,120
...with his own Water Shot?!

199
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,330
That man is a monster, too!

200
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,670
I don't know how you've
attained that much power

201
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,090
but your Fish-Man Karate is very unskilled!

202
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,760
He was the first Fish-Man
to join the Seven Warlords!

203
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,100
And after he resigned,
his bounty exceeded 400 million berries!

204
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,020
How can we fight a guy like that?!

205
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,070
Shut up and bring it on!

206
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,820
You have to kill us all in
order to kill the Princess!

207
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,070
Why are you hesitating?!

208
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,410
There is nowhere for you to run!

209
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,290
N-No way!

210
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,250
How boring.

211
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,300
How rude.

212
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,390
Hold your tongue until you've beaten
the formidable line of defense...

213
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,310
...of the New Fish-Man Pirates!

214
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,110
We'll even smash that sword you're proud of!

215
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,450
Go, Iron Shell Squad!

216
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,370
Please!

217
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,370
Train me as a swordsman!

218
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,900
They're really just copying
what "Hawk-Eye" does!

219
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,780
It's a pain in the ass to
fight all these weaklings!

220
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,080
Here we go again - just like that time!

221
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,790
I... I swore to become stronger, didn't I?!

222
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,180
I will never lose again!

223
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,050
Three-Sword Style!

224
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,110
Black Rope Dragon Twister!

225
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,490
What?!

226
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,080
He cut through their iron
shells as if they were fruit!

227
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,870
What was that attack?! It looked like the
Grim Reaper's scythe or something!

228
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,420
I-It's still going on!

229
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,550
--It won't stop!
--It's like a cyclone of blades!

230
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,720
--Run! Or you're gonna get cut!
--Don't come after us!

231
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,890
It'll chase you to hell's end!

232
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,770
Use your brains, fools!

233
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,400
Use your bubbles to float!

234
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,940
Let's hit them from the sky!

235
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,400
Kill Princess Shirahoshi!

236
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,660
How sneaky.

237
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,240
Outta my way!

238
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,660
We'll impale you all!

239
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,910
Go, Harisenbon!

240
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,960
It's the Sea Urchin Spike Unit
led by Commander Harisenbon!

241
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,090
Impale that kick-fighting guy!

242
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,720
Hari, sen, bon!

243
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,180
Now, you have nowhere to hide!

244
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,390
Sanji-san, watch out!

245
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,860
How can you act so relaxed?! Hey!

246
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,370
It's been a while already...

247
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,410
Sanji-kun!

248
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,080
I ran.

249
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,590
Wait, candy-chan!

250
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,340
No way, screw you!

251
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,510
I brought my favorite dress for you!

252
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,800
--Put it on!
--You don't need to be shy!

253
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,640
I said I won't wear it! I'm not being shy!

254
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,600
In the rain, in the snow,

255
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,900
in the rolling thunder, I ran and ran...

256
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,450
Go to hell, kick-fighting guy!

257
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,240
You silly boy!

258
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,620
Do you think you can escape us forever?!

259
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,370
Sanji-kun!

260
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,840
I shouldn't have trouble
dealing with these fools!

261
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,220
Sanji-kun!

262
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,800
Damn you!

263
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,720
Stop! Sanji!

264
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,520
Do I forget what happened
at Sabaody, already?!

265
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,360
Sanji-kun!

266
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,650
What I need to do now is to
get all the Vital Recipes

267
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,610
from the grand masters of the New Kama Kempo!

268
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,530
You fools will...

269
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,410
Sanji-kun!

270
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,040
You let your guard down, candy boy!

271
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,500
What?

272
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,710
Sanji-kun!

273
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,380
You're already surrounded by New Kamas!

274
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,930
Sanji-kun!

275
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,930
Sanji-kun-kun!

276
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,850
Sanji-kun-kun-kun!

277
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,190
Then one day, I finally got cornered and...

278
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,620
I ran...

279
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,170
Ouch, ouch! Ow, ow, ow...
Huh? Where did he go?

280
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,840
I ran...

281
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,970
Sanji-kun!

282
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,810
And I...--

283
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,980
...ended up...

284
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,230
...flying!

285
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
He's up there!

286
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,280
Sky...

287
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,830
...Walk!

288
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,370
Cool! Sanji is in the air!
Like those people in the past!

289
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,760
That's the Moon Walk of CP9's!

290
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,470
Hey, you guys!

291
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,760
--What?!
--He's flying!

292
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,810
If you wanna talk to Shirahoshi-chan,
you need to talk to me first!

293
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm the notorious knight...

294
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
...here to protect you!

295
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,320
Sanji-chin-sama!

296
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,940
Don't push your luck too far!

297
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,950
Let's cook these small fries!

298
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,950
Diable Jambe...

299
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,410
...Poele a Frire...

300
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,160
...Spectre!

301
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,100
Hey, you!

302
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,520
It's gonna be over soon so just stay still!

303
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,570
Doesn't matter if there
are 100,000 or 1,000,000!

304
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,660
We'll just beat them all!

305
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,750
Brooke and Robin use the

306
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,100
exquisite techniques
learned in their two years

307
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,090
of training to defeat their opponents.

308
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,640
But the New Fish-Man Pirates' Deadly
Venom Squad begin a counterattack,

309
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,930
things start getting dangerous

310
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,180
when Franky, Usopp and Chopper

311
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,310
bring out a wondrous new weapon!

312
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,690
"Unveiled! The Secret
Weapons of the Sunny!"

314
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
