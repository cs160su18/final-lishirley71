00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,660
"The Pirates' Banquet and
Operation Escape from Alabasta!"

20
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,200
Oh... That compounding is amazing!

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,080
Unusual, I might say... Well, it's
indeed practical. It's wonderful...

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,270
What?

23
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,730
Where on earth did you
learn those medical skills?

24
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,230
Tony-kun is a doctor from Drum.

25
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,960
Why! Is that so? The Drum that used to
be the land of advanced medical care...

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,800
--Ahh...!
--I see...

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,670
Their medicine is advanced as I thought...

28
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,910
I've been a doctor for 40 years,

29
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,680
but I didn't know such
techniques existed at all.

30
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,830
--Ah...
--This is really wonderful.

31
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,560
Though you're so young,
I'm no match for you.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,330
Shut up! Don't stare at me like that,
you idiot! Go away, you bastard!

33
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,830
"Well, have some tea and watch as much
as you like"... Can I take it that way?

34
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,120
I think you can.

35
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,580
Well... really, you're outstanding!

36
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,510
Shut up...

37
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,920
I can only say I'm impressed.
Boy oh boy, you've got splendid skills!

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,860
Go away! Shut up, you bastard!

39
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,500
Hey! Do you have more lumber?

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,750
I don't have enough, either!

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,780
I've got some extra. Go ahead and use it.

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,140
Oh, thanks!

43
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,080
This country is sturdy...

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,850
That's because the princess is cute.

45
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,520
--That has something to do with it?
--It does!

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Dammit! House after house is penetrated!

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,150
What's this hole? It looks as if
someone kicked and broke them.

48
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,860
Urk!

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,120
I don't have time to go around!
I'll take a shortcut!

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,300
Whoa! This is terrible.

51
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,480
Hey, Usopp! Look!
There's something over there...

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,620
Huh?

53
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,700
I'll improve my concentration...

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,160
Until I can bring out that power any time...
I can't consider myself stronger.

55
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,460
Whoa... They're all interesting books!
Is it really okay to take them with me?

56
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,310
Yeah, that's fine, since I've read all of them.

57
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,030
Thank you! Then I'll help myself.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,700
Did you not hear me say
I don't know?! Go back!

59
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,100
If you lie, it'll harm your country!
Sheltering pirates is a felony.

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,190
--Hey, what's up?
--Hey.

61
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh, welcome back.

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,080
I think we were able to purchase enough,

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,860
--considering the state this city is in...
--Do you have any evidence
that pirates are here?!

64
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,660
--Yeah...
--Do you have any evidence
that pirates are here?!

65
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,620
W-Well, that's...

66
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,580
I wonder if he woke up...

67
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,590
If he wakes up, things'll get noisy, though...

68
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,140
Boy... I slept really well!

69
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,450
Oh? My hat? My hat! Where's my hat?!

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,350
I'm starving! Breakfast! Hey, breakfast!
Where's my hat?! Breakfast! My hat?!

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,200
You just woke up and you're already loud!

72
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,030
And it won't be breakfast.
It's early evening right now.

73
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,320
Your hat is over there. A soldier found
it for you in front of the palace.

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,250
Oh, good!

75
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm glad you got well, Luffy-san!

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,200
Got well? I've always been well.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,360
You dummy! You were in serious
condition with a high fever and stuff.

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,660
Vivi and Chopper attended you all this time!

79
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,380
Really? Thanks!

80
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
Oh hey, Luffy! You woke up?

81
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,120
Hey, Zoro, long time no see!
"Long time no see"?

82
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,950
Ahh, hey! You went out
training again, didn't you?!

83
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,640
What? It's my business, right?

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,720
No means no! I'm the ship doctor!
And don't take off the bandages, either!

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,430
It's hard to move with them.

86
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,190
Don't move!

87
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,230
"Long time no see"...? "Long time no see"?

88
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,940
Well, it's probably natural to feel
that way... since you slept for three days.

89
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,230
Three days?! Did I sleep
for three whole days?!

90
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,860
Yep.

91
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,200
I missed 15 meals...

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,440
How come you can calculate so
quickly when it comes to food?!

93
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,200
On top of that, in his calculations
there are five meals a day!

94
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,910
Did I hear right that the captain is up?!

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,960
It'll be dinner time soon,
so would you wait a little?

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,920
--Wha...?!
--Oh hey, old tube-hair guy! You're alive?!

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,170
S... So you really were
into that sort of thing...

98
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,220
No, everyone. She's Terracotta-san.

99
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,160
She's Igaram's wife and is also
the head of the palace's servers.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,140
Thanks for helping
Vivi-sama and my husband.

101
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,520
No way...! A wife could resemble
her husband, but this is too much!

102
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,620
I heard you eat a lot.

103
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,080
Would you have some fruit to
hold you over until dinner time?

104
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,140
Okay.

105
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,320
Are you a magician?!

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,640
Lady, I'm gonna eat
three days worth of food!

107
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,180
Looking forward to it! I've devoted
my past 30 years to the job of serving!

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,780
I won't lose against a youngster's stomach,
so eat to your heart's content!

109
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,310
They don't have a shred of dignity...

110
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,670
Meals at this dining hall are
supposed to be quieter than this...

111
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,340
So, it wasn't an empty boast.
But I won't lose!

112
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,800
Eat quick or it'll be gone!

113
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,300
Hey, Luffy! You just took the
food from my plate, didn't you?!

114
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,220
Don't spit the food!

115
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,180
Hey hey, if you eat in
a hurry like that, you'll...

116
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,310
We've got a lot, so...

117
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,060
Well then, wait and see, Luffy.
I'll put the Tabasco Star on this.

118
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,620
Hey! When did you...?!

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,240
What do you call that dish?

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,740
This is called konafa. You bake
noodles in the oven and...

121
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,700
Delicious!

122
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,560
Now, here's more!

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,200
Off man, I diffn mow mu mere meh ming!

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,390
Men mu're... muff... Mimi's mad, muh?

125
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,580
W-Well... we can talk after the dinner.

126
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,330
Meah, mu're might.

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,760
Can I have another mug full?!

128
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,300
Hey, we need some water here!

129
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,590
What a noisy dinner table...

130
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,640
They're too vulgar to keep watching...

131
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,400
How can Vivi-sama just keep laughing...?

132
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,410
--Whoa!
--This is the palace's proud main bath.

133
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,090
We normally use this only
during the rainy season.

134
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,140
Amazing! This is gorgeous! Gorgeous!

135
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,680
--I'll be the first to go in!
--No, I'll be the first!

136
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,560
Are you guys enjoying that?

137
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,660
Well, I really enjoyed the dinner.

138
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,730
Because of the current situation,
I thought we'd keep it simple,

139
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,530
but it seems that anything you guys
get involved with would become a party.

140
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,740
Hey Zoro, look at this! We can train here!

141
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,540
--Training! Training!
--What training is that?!

142
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,190
So where's the women's bath?

143
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,200
Are you nuts?! Why would I tell you?!

144
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,660
Vivi-sama's there!

145
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,500
Don't be so stingy!

146
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,150
It's behind that wall!

147
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,800
King! You bastard!

148
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,680
Hey, old guy! You're not bad at all!

149
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,930
This feels good! I wonder if a ship
with a big bath like this exists...

150
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,230
I'm sure it does, since the sea is so vast.

151
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,570
We saw giants... We saw dinosaurs...

152
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,840
We also saw cherry blossoms
bloom in a winter land...

153
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,690
There're more and more things in the
sea that are beyond our imagination!

154
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,450
--Well...
--It's my turn.

155
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,860
Thank you.

156
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,720
Hm?

157
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,680
Hey, what're you all doing?!

158
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,150
Those idiots...

159
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,790
It'll be 100,000 berries per person, okay?!

160
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,250
Hm?

161
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,250
Happiness Punch!

162
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,630
Nami-san!

163
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,470
Mellorine...

164
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,870
You can't make up your mind, can you...?

165
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,440
What?

166
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,380
I'm thinking that we might
wanna leave here tonight...

167
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,480
What? Really?

168
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,250
Because we no longer have
a reason to stay here, right?

169
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,760
The Navy is probably at the
harbor ready to capture us.

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
Our ship will be in danger soon.

171
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,830
Thank you...

172
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,030
--You dirty old man...
--I'm not talking about that!

173
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,750
I'm talking about the country.

174
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,310
Hey hey, is it okay... for a
king to do such a thing...?

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,960
This is a serious incident, Cobra-sama.

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,520
A king shouldn't bow his head to anyone.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,320
Igaram... Authority is something
you wear over your clothes.

178
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,490
But we're in the bath. There isn't
such a thing as a naked king.

179
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,360
I'd like to thank you from
the bottom of my heart

180
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,850
as a father and as a resident of this land.

181
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,090
Thank you very much.

182
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,340
I really appreciate it!

183
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,060
--Tonight?!
--That's right.

184
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,810
Leaving here?

185
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,680
Well, I think it's appropriate, too,

186
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,920
since we no longer have
a reason to stay here.

187
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,520
Yeah... I'm also worried
about the Navy's actions.

188
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,310
Okay, then. You decide, Luffy.

189
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,610
Okay! We'll leave after we have
some more Alabasta dishes again.

190
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,000
We're leaving right away, idiot!

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,490
--Idiot!
--You don't all have to...

192
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,200
What should we do, Igaram-san?!
We have to let them know right away.

193
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,160
Yeah, of course. But...
this is becoming a big deal...

194
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,280
I hope they can leave this island safely...

195
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,130
How quickly they prepared...!

196
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,670
Roronoa Zoro. His bounty
is 60 million berries!

197
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,870
Monkey D. Luffy. His bounty
is 100 million berries!

198
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,090
--Igaram-san...
--With bounties of this level,

199
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,690
flag officers at Navy Headquarters
will surely start taking actions.

200
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,460
You can no longer go back, Luffy-kun.

201
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,940
You and your crew took down one pillar
of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

202
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,050
There's trouble!

203
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,530
Vivi-sama, where are they?!

204
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,000
What is it, Igaram? What's the big hurry?

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,980
Where did Luffy-kun and the others go?

206
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,940
To the sea... They're pirates, you know...

207
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,490
Oh, no...

208
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,410
Listen, you guys. Pirates are scum.

209
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,410
"Navy Headquarters Sergeant,
Jango the Traitor"

210
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,950
Hey, what're you saying?
Don't you remember?

211
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,410
"Navy Headquarters Sergeant,
Iron Fists Fullbody"

212
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,410
You used to be a pirate, right?

213
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,020
Urk! That's right! You're exactly right, baby!

214
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,240
Wanna dance?!

215
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,710
Ahh! Yeah! Dance! Dance!

216
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,400
Dance! Dance!

217
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,570
Looks like those two took down
the enemy ship and returned.

218
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,570
It took them forever.
I wonder what they were doing.

219
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,720
I put trust in their ability and left the
ship we were attacking in their hands...

220
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,060
Disappointed. I'm disappointed.

221
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,150
Have you finished deploying the ships?

222
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,800
Yes, ma'am! It's perfect!

223
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,900
We've completely blocked
every harbor in the country!

224
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
--However...
--Hm?

225
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,380
There's just one thing
I'm concerned about...

226
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,230
What is it?

227
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,880
About the Straw Hats' ship that I
thought we confirmed in Erumalu...

228
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,940
It's gone...

229
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,750
Don't tell me they've
already left this country...

230
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,510
No... I don't think that's the case...

231
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,080
Then search for it... every corner of the coast!

232
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,460
Yes, ma'am! Will do!

233
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,840
--Geez...
--Miss Hina! Sorry it took so long!

234
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,330
Please ask us why it took so long.

235
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,810
Why did it take so long?

236
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,020
--We were picking flowers... for you...!
--Don't need them.

237
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,910
Man your positions right away!
We'll take down the Straw Hat gang!

238
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,480
S-Straw Hats?!

239
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,170
Hmmm... This is nice.

240
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,730
So this is finally farewell
to the sand kingdom...

241
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,160
Hey, Luffy, when are you gonna stop eating?

242
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,220
The Alabasta dishes are great!
Sanji, make them sometime...

243
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,040
Yeah. I was interested, too, so I got
some recipes from Terracotta-san.

244
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,120
Some spices, too.

245
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,340
Nami, are you feeling sick?

246
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,300
Nami, do you want one piece
of meat? Just one piece, though.

247
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,900
Nami-san, you're thinking
about Vivi-chan, right?

248
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,310
I understand how you're feeling...
but thinking doesn't get you anywhere.

249
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,750
Yeah, I know... you two were really close...

250
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,270
But hey... chin up.

251
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,220
I...

252
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,580
For Vivi's sake... I'm willing to give up...

253
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,080
...on the 1 billion berries...

254
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,870
--Of course you should!
--So it was about money?!

255
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,740
Ah! Usopp fell!

256
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,010
Nami! Don't act misleading!

257
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,220
What?! What're you guys worked up about?

258
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,640
If it's about Vivi, it's no use
worrying about it, right?

259
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,300
Hey! Usopp fell!

260
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,800
Leave him be.

261
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,460
It was your fault!

262
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,940
Karoo! Where are you, Karoo?!

263
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,980
It's no use, Igaram.

264
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,600
Why? We should at least let them
know their current situation.

265
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,390
Since I had the Duck Squadron
take them, even Karoo can't catch up.

266
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,750
And it won't change anything...

267
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,030
What won't change?

268
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,240
They'll be happy when they know it.
That's all. Nothing will change.

269
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,130
--But...!
--They'll be fine!

270
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,000
Now, leave! I'm going to bed!
You have to get up early, right?

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,710
Ah... yes. That's right. We have to let
the entire country hear your voice.

272
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,590
I know. Come here, Karoo.
Let's sleep together.

273
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,000
--Hmm...
--Igaram-san.

274
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,320
Something's bothering me...

275
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,890
What is it?

276
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,640
She's too calm... Hmm...

277
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,610
Strange... There's something strange...

278
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,820
It's quiet, isn't it, Karoo?

279
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,040
We haven't had a quiet night
like this for a long time...

280
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,200
The cook who fights with
the fridge robber is gone...

281
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,580
The swordsman who trains
every night is also gone...

282
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,780
The navigator who throws her
pillow half asleep is gone, too...

283
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,930
They're all gone...

284
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,020
Transponder snail
communication? From who?

285
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,060
From someone named Bon-chan.

286
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,550
Bon-chan? Who's that?

287
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,080
No one knows him.

288
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,900
But he insists he's your friend, so...

289
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,980
Our friend?

290
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,000
Hello? Hi there!

291
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,410
It's me! Me! Uhm...

292
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,240
What?! Shut up!

293
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,120
Hey, it's you, huh?
What do you want from us?

294
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,090
Oh? That voice must be Straw Hat, right?

295
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,640
You're strong! I was so surprised!

296
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,840
Oh, yeah... Don't call me Mr. 2.

297
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,900
If this signal is caught by
the Navy, I'll be in trouble.

298
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,770
You just said it yourself!

299
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,200
Just tell us what you want!

300
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,700
Oh, yeah... I took your ship.

301
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,600
That's not funny!

302
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,590
You son of a bitch! This isn't a
joking matter! Where're you now?!

303
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,700
On your ship.

304
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,240
Of all others, he...

305
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,570
No, no...! Gee...

306
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,850
We're friends, right?

307
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,020
He's at the upper reaches
of the Sandora River...

308
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,190
Can we trust him?

309
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,430
We became friends one time, but...

310
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,990
In your case, you may be able to make
friends with him again, which is scary...

311
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,800
But we have no choice but to go...

312
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,970
He's right. He has our ship.

313
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,270
If he tries to trick us,
then we'll just beat him up.

314
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,200
Now that it's decided, let's get ready quickly.

315
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,240
Okay! Let's hurry. If we don't
get there quickly, our ship will...

316
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,480
Say, everyone...

317
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,630
Say... everyone...

318
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,280
What... should I do...?

319
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,400
Listen well, Vivi. We'll give you 12 hours.

320
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,710
"Current Location: Alubarna"
"Nanohana" "Sandora River"

321
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,340
Once we take our ship
back on the Sandora River,

322
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,160
we'll draw the ship near the eastern harbor
just once at exactly noon tomorrow.

323
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,590
"Eastern Harbor"

324
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,590
We probably won't be able to anchor.

325
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,310
If you want to continue traveling with us,

326
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,630
that moment is the only
chance to come aboard.

327
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,480
If that happens, we'll welcome you...
though you'll become a pirate.

328
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,750
Since you're a princess of a country,
this is the best we can do to invite you.

329
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,310
Come, Vivi! Definitely come! Come now!

330
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,940
--Stop it, Luffy.
--Let's go.

331
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,630
Why?! Don't you want her to come?

332
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,910
That's not the point!
It's something Vivi has to decide!

333
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,200
Noon tomorrow...

334
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,940
If it's the eastern harbor, it'll take
four hours to get there on Karoo...

335
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,540
If I leave here at 8, I'll make it on time...

336
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,100
I've never thought of becoming a pirate.

337
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,850
If I miss this chance, I'll never have
such a choice for the rest of my life...

338
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,760
I've never thought that being
a princess was uninteresting,

339
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,360
and the country is still at a critical point,
though the rebellion is over...

340
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,010
If I go, you'll go too, right?

341
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,040
Say... Karoo...

342
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,860
What... would you like to do?

343
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,950
I've been waiting, you guys!

344
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,090
Long time no see!

345
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,360
We're here!

346
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,170
Okay, unload! Thanks, you guys!

347
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,570
We have to say goodbye to you here.

348
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,720
Have a safe trip back!

349
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,020
Say hello to the King, the old
tube-hair guy and the others!

350
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,730
Take care!

351
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:18,400
I'll see you... definitely
see you again someday!

352
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,110
Hm? Wait a sec!

353
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,490
--What?!
--Don't "what" me!

354
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,200
That's not how you should
treat your friend, is it?!

355
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,040
What do you mean "friend"?
We were enemies. You lied to us!

356
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,900
I didn't lie! I didn't know it, either!

357
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,750
But you see... who cares about it anymore?

358
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,990
Baroque Works fell. We're no longer enemi...

359
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,630
--Hey, move over...
--Oh, sorry.

360
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,530
Even if we're not enemies,
why are you on our ship?!

361
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,600
--You stupid head!
--What'd you say?!

362
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,560
Listen! If I wasn't on this ship now,

363
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,060
what do you think would've happened to it?!

364
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,400
It might've been taken by the Navy.

365
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,780
--What?!
--It's not "might've"!
It definitely would've happened!

366
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,900
Do you know what's going on
around this island right now?!

367
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,740
It's completely blocked by
the Navy ships! It's blocked!

368
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,280
What?! Then you protected
the Going Merry from the Navy?!

369
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,450
--Why?!
--How come?!

370
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,000
Because we're friends!

371
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,040
Do we still have stuff to load?

372
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,510
Nope. This is the last one.

373
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,680
In other words, Mr. 2...

374
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,780
You guys couldn't get off of the
island due to the Navy's coast siege,

375
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,030
so you wanted to find allies...
Isn't that right?

376
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,230
Bon-chan!

377
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,030
That's right... In a time like this...
Because it's a time like this...

378
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,090
Gather! In the name of friendship!

379
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,690
Let's unite our strength and fight together!

380
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,250
Yeah!

381
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,160
Geez...

382
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,530
Yeah!

383
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,830
So, thanks in advance!

384
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,370
You were there?!

385
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,330
Miss Hina! Miss Hina!

386
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,360
We found it! We found the Straw Hats' ship!

387
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,840
Near the upper reaches of the Sandora River!

388
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,550
Prepare to fight.

389
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:27,240
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

390
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,160
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

391
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,420
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

392
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:44,840
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

393
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,090
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

394
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,520
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

395
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,320
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

396
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,020
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

397
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:09,280
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

398
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

399
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,280
A never-ending journey to be together

400
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,930
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

401
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,210
Vivi will come, right?

402
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,500
Adventures are fun.
There's no way she won't come.

403
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,560
Give up, Luffy. Her case
is different from ours.

404
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,800
Hey, this is bad! The Navy
is following us again!

405
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,340
There's no way she won't come!
She'll be a pirate with us!

406
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,000
Father... Igaram... I have something
important to talk with you about.

407
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,300
On the next episode of One Piece!

408
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,900
"It All Started on That Day!
Vivi Tells the Story of Her Adventure!"

409
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,590
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
