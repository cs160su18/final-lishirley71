We are the one! Go ahead!

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,070
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

66
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

67
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

68
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

69
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

70
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,620
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

71
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

72
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,480
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,310
and have come to Dressrosa.

74
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,480
Luffy entered a fighting competition - in
which a winner will get the Flare-Flare Fruit

76
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,320
as the prize - and won the first round

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,360
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law who's

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,150
been captured by Doflamingo.

81
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,190
Special Attack: Green Star - Platanus...

82
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,390
...Shuriken!

83
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,270
"A Fateful Encounter!
Kyros and King Riku!"

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,620
Usoland!

85
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,590
Usoland!

86
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,660
Usoland!

87
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,730
Usoland!!

88
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,250
I-I did it!

89
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,420
There's only one girl left to beat!

90
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,020
I don't wanna go rough on a little girl
but I've got no choice!

91
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,980
I have to put the Tatababasco grape
into Sugar's mouth somehow!

92
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,180
Trebol.

93
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,550
I can't believe you got
beaten by a guy like him.

94
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,380
You idiot. Drop dead.

95
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,370
I'm not dead yet, you little shit!

96
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,010
Wh-What's with this guy?!

97
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,580
Hey, hey! If you'd just kept running,
you might have survived!

98
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,010
But you took the trouble
to come back to be killed!

99
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,840
THE ROYAL PALACE 2ND FLOOR - THE SUIT CHAMBER

100
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,410
There was a report that you,
sir, were on the 1st floor!

101
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,210
Huh? What're you talking about?

102
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,000
Does it mean somebody who
looked like him was there?

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,870
Have you ever seen anybody
who looks like me in the palace?

104
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,500
King Riku-sama!

105
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,560
This sword looks good.

106
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,190
If I can turn back into a human,
I wanna use this!

107
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,980
My father was fighting
in the Colosseum today.

108
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,010
What? Is it true?

109
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,000
I couldn't believe Doflamingo's abdication
was a false report.

110
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,730
It was just this morning
and we all lost patience.

111
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,700
King Riku-sama was fighting
in the Colosseum?!

112
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,790
A boy committed a murder!
Two people got killed in a squabble in the slum!

113
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,270
The boy is now...

114
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,360
Stop resisting!

115
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,010
A BOY IN THE SLUM - KYROS (15 YEARS OLD)

116
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,440
How can he move like that?!

117
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,560
We have no choice but to shoot him!

118
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,530
--No way! He's just a boy!
--But...

119
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,310
King Riku-sama!

120
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,840
King Riku-sama! What are you doing?!
It's dangerous!

121
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,550
Although he's just a boy,
he's an infamous thug!

122
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,990
I don't care if you're the king or not!
Whoever approaches me will...

123
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,280
The king is in danger! Open fire!

124
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Wait! Don't shoot!
Put your guns down!

125
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,770
B-But...

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,070
I heard you fought dozens of hooligans
on your own.

127
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,710
And more than the half of them got injured

128
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,810
and two of them got killed.

129
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,620
They ganged up on my best friend
and killed him!

130
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,690
So I was just getting revenge for him!

131
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,910
Are you a beast?

132
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,560
Say whatever you like!
A royal person like you can't understand!

133
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,440
He was the only person I trusted
in the whole world!

134
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,520
He was like a brother to me!

135
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,070
Your name is Kyros, isn't it?

136
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,010
Stay away from him, King Riku-sama!

137
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,490
King Riku-sama!

138
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,590
Come with me!

139
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,170
A 15-year-old murderer - Kyros!

140
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,870
He's gonna fight against an experienced gladiator!

141
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,610
This Colosseum is a sacred place!

142
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,680
A murderer like you doesn't belong here!

143
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,210
Teach him a lesson!

144
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,120
The battle starts!

145
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,880
Are you gonna keep looking
at the sword, brat?

146
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,390
The sword's blade may be blunt,

147
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,260
but prepare to get some of your limbs broken!

148
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,960
I-I can't believe it! Kyros wins!

149
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,310
The winner is the 15-year-old
murderer - Kyros!

150
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,940
--It's not over yet!
--That's enough! Stop!

151
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,050
He's so talented!

152
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,460
If the blade wasn't blunt, he
would've killed his opponent!

153
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,950
Barbarism looks a lot
like a talent here, huh?

154
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,020
How is Kyros doing?

155
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,730
He nearly killed all the convict
gladiators in his room.

156
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,460
He hasn't eaten for six days
and just keeps shouting "Call King Riku."

157
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
Dammit!

158
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,240
What's wrong, Kyros?

159
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,370
King Riku! What are you gonna do with me?!

160
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,410
If you're gonna execute me, do it already!

161
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,550
Shoot me or hang me or whatever you like!

162
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Do you want to die so badly?

163
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,250
Or are you regretting what you did?

164
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,830
Regret? I thought you were different
and you understood me!

165
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,610
Kill me! Just kill me!

166
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,300
The gladiatorial contest that
you fought in the other day

167
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,770
wasn't just a deadly competition or a show.

168
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,820
It has been going on for several centuries
in this country.

169
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,070
It's a sacred event in which
fighters discipline their mind

170
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,940
and hone their sword skill.

171
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,240
Do you want to become a gladiator?

172
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,890
A gladiator? Me?

173
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,120
King Riku-sama is planning
to release you on parole

174
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,350
once you win 100 matches in
as much time as it takes.

175
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,690
FOUR MONTHS LATER

176
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,020
Kick the murderer's ass!

177
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,450
Bring down Kyros!

178
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,340
Kyros wins 20 consecutive matches!
He's unbelievably strong!

179
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,180
Kyros wins 50 consecutive matches!

180
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,090
Kyros wins 100 out of 100 matches!

181
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,960
Even the star gladiator couldn't do anything!

182
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,520
He finally won his freedom
in such a short period of time!

183
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,400
How could anyone be that strong?!

184
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,610
Don't come out, murderer!

185
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,200
--Hey!
--Think about it!

186
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,890
If someone like him gets released,
he may kill more people again!

187
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,340
--She's right.
--Uh-huh.

188
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,810
Yeah! Don't come back
on the street, murderer!

189
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,990
--Don't release him!
--Keep fighting until you die!

190
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,880
You're gonna stay?

191
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,730
I won't go out where people don't want me.

192
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,570
Since when did you want to become
the person other people wanted?

193
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,790
Shut up!

194
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,980
People like beasts...

195
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,760
...as long as they stay...

196
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,110
...in a cage!

197
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,000
Even if...

198
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,310
...I get out of the cage,

199
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,090
there is no place...

200
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,770
...for me to go back!

201
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,790
There is nowhere for me to belong out there!

202
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,840
His 200th win!

203
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,580
--Somebody, bring down Kyros!
--Defeat Kyros!

204
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,020
His 300th win!

205
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
Nobody can stop Kyros!

206
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,850
The heroes have been brought
down one after another!

207
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,060
Finally!

208
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,360
Finally - an unprecedented 1000th victory!

209
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,920
HIS 4TH YEAR AT THE COLOSSEUM

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,970
Kyros-sama!

211
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,870
Way to go, Kyros!

212
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,590
The ire of the crowd
turned to adulation before I knew it.

213
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,630
However...

214
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,560
You're here again.

215
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,860
--Kyros.
--Go away!

216
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,280
You don't understand!

217
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,960
No matter where I go,
I'll be a beast...

218
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,150
...who killed men for the rest of my life!

219
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,340
I wish...

220
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,190
...everybody would forget about me!

221
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,020
A mysterious tough man who
came into sudden prominence,

222
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,690
going by "Ricky", is fighting Kyros!

223
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,870
Go, Kyros!

224
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,030
The odds are for Kyros who will mark
his 3000th win if he wins this match

225
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,300
but Ricky isn't giving up an inch!

226
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,860
Whoa! Ricky landed a blow against Kyros!

227
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,180
Kyros has never taken a single hit
from an opponent before!

228
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,500
Kyros wins!

229
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,190
He won 3000 out of 3000 in nine years!
He's never lost!

230
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,000
The living legend - Kyros!
The word "invincible" truly only fits to this man!

231
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,010
Yeah, Kyros!

232
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,370
Why did you enter secretly,
King Riku-sama?!

233
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,580
I became quite strong after you
taught me how to fight, didn't I?

234
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,810
But you lowered your guard
when you noticed it was me.

235
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,420
You're not such a "beast" after all.

236
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,710
Isn't that enough now?

237
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,790
You've spent your life locked away
in this "cage" for nine years.

238
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,280
You need to leave now.
There's something I need you to do.

239
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,550
Kyros.

240
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,370
Rather than regretting
what you did in the past,

241
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,740
you can save many lives from now on.

242
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,920
That's one way for you to live.

243
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,630
Yes, sir!

244
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,490
Kyros! We'll be counting on you!

245
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,710
A YEAR LATER

246
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,400
Kyros! Thank you always for your service!

247
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,520
THE COMMANDER OF THE DRESSROSA KING RIKU ARMY
KYROS (25 YEARS OLD)

248
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,870
Oh! Kyros-sama!

249
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,940
Protect me!

250
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,540
Girls love you so much, huh?!
Kyros-sama!

251
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,530
But you're a murderer!

252
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,320
I don't understand why Father-sama
lets you in to the palace!

253
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,990
P-Princess-sama!

254
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,720
Big Sis, don't!
You can't bring up his old pain!

255
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,960
I can't believe he even assigned you
to be the commander of the righteous army!

256
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,620
Big Sis!

257
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,520
Even if you can fool the whole
nation, you can't fool me!

258
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:07,260
THE PRINCESS OF DRESSROSA
- SCARLET (15 YEARS OLD)

259
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,970
You'll reveal your true colors someday!

260
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,670
Don't come near me and my sister!

261
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,280
Don't touch us!

262
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,270
Understood?!

263
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,510
But Big Sis, he's kind of...

264
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,130
THE SECOND PRINCESS (THE YOUNGER SISTER) -
VIOLA (10 YEARS OLD)

265
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,490
Hey! Don't look into his mind!

266
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,610
His mind is corrupted!

267
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,820
But I'm responsible for protecting you two!

268
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,350
No thanks!

269
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,490
--Lady Scarlet has been kidnapped!
--They were pirates!

270
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,200
--What happened to her bodyguards?!
--They all got beaten up!

271
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,100
--What?!
--What should we do?!

272
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,600
--Just calm down!
--Don't touch me!

273
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,760
Nobody's gonna come rescue you!

274
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,910
How about we get a lot of
money from King Riku as ransom

275
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,680
and just sell her?!

276
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,920
That's a good idea! She's a real princess!
We can make a good price!

277
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,820
Lady Scarlet!

278
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,130
Kyros!

279
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,230
Who are you?!

280
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,700
Stay close behind me!

281
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,720
You bastards!

282
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,310
Are you all right, Lady Scarlet?

283
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,200
I-I'm sorry!

284
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,490
I-I touched you!

285
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,320
Kyros! I was scared!

286
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,370
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

287
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,700
Big Sis is cooking something!

288
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,630
What's gotten into her?!

289
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,910
Oh no!

290
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,590
What did you say?!

291
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,540
You wanna resign as my daughters' bodyguard?!

292
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,140
Why're you saying that all of a sudden?!

293
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
Oh, well... I mean...

294
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,010
Don't tell me you're in love with Scarlet?

295
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,480
What?!
N-No, I'm not! I swear...

296
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,020
Kyros!

297
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,380
I am, sir.

298
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,560
The greatest hero in the
history of the Colosseum

299
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,300
and the commander of the
army. And the princess.

300
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,400
I know each individual will
celebrate your marriage

301
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,330
but social constraints
won't allow your criminal record.

302
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,110
That's how public life works.

303
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,880
Father-sama!
If I can't marry him, I'd rather die!

304
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,000
Lady Scarlet...

305
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,760
It was a sudden illness.

306
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,350
I'm sure she would've become
a great queen someday.

307
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,110
Scarlet. As of today,
you're not a member of the royal family.

308
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,310
People think you're dead.

309
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,470
Yes.

310
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,750
It feels like I'm repaying your kindness
with ingratitude, King Riku-sama.

311
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,400
It's unforgivable!

312
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,810
If it were anyone else but you.

313
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,140
Kyros! I've never heard a story like this!

314
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,980
Thank you, sir!

315
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,220
Her name is Rebecca.

316
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,190
Kyros, hold her in your arms.
She's your daughter!

317
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,230
I shouldn't touch such an innocent thing!

318
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,470
My hands are tainted!
I don't wanna taint her!

319
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,370
Your father is a strange man, Rebecca.

320
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,580
You're like an angel, Rebecca!

321
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,850
I'll be watching over you!
I'll always be by your side!

322
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,660
Peek-a-boo! Your grandpa is here!

323
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,290
Grandpa!

324
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,060
Rebecca! You got big again!

325
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Father-sama, take off your disguise!

326
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,160
Kyros!

327
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,370
Gloves, gloves!

328
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,300
How cute she is! How cute she is!

329
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,340
You're crying again!

330
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,950
I'd never expected that
I could have such happiness.

331
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,390
But it didn't last long.

332
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,000
That was 10 years ago...

333
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,910
What's going on?!

334
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,160
King Riku-sama!

335
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,740
10 years ago, the Toy Soldier was tragically torn
from his loved ones!

336
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,490
Shouldering the burden of
everybody's expectations,

337
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,530
Usopp fights Trebol to the full extent of his power!

338
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,400
Will he bring a miracle?!

339
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,320
On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Operation Failed! Usoland the Hero Dies?!"

340
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,790
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
