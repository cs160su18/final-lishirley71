morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Put the pieces of our dreams together

and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

there will be a chain of
burning, intense excitement!

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,460
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,840
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,660
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,970
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,480
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,560
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,270
They freed the toys who had been forced to
labor as slaves

74
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,910
but Doflamingo trapped everybody in the country
in the Birdcage

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,280
and put prices on the heads
of Luffy and 11 others.

76
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,250
Cien Fleurs!

77
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,570
Spider Net!

78
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,590
Bartolomeo-san! Hack-san!

79
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,060
We can climb up from here!

80
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,030
I'm gonna crush you all at once!

81
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,400
Hasshoken Secret Technique!
Drill Dragon...

82
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,900
King...

83
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,800
...Punch!

84
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,410
...Nail!

85
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,880
Damn you!

86
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,340
"Steady Progress!
Luffy's Army vs. Pica!"

87
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,910
Pica-sama!

88
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,880
--What a big piece of shit!
--There is nothing that my drill head can't grind!

89
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,010
Run!

90
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,200
These are nothing against my drill head!

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,340
I got it back thanks to him.

92
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,420
That was close!

93
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,190
Go Moocy! To the Palace!

94
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,510
Don't get hit!
We're counting on you, Moocy!

95
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,900
Hey! I told you not to come with me!
Get off of Moocy!

96
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,470
Whoa, don't say that! Please!

97
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,370
Straw Hat-san! Please let us!

98
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,580
Moocy! We're counting on you!

99
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,800
Where did he go?! Straw Hat!

100
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,220
Hey! Don't let them through!
They're heading to the Palace!

101
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,760
Outta our way!

102
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,570
Get out of our way!

103
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,710
Sai and Boo?!

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,580
In the name of the Happosui Army,
we'll repay our debt!

105
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,970
I'm gonna fight you guys!

106
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,220
Ideo the champion fighter?!

107
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,140
Don't let Straw Hat get away!

108
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,090
You better pay attention!

109
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,030
Destruction Cannon!

110
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,100
If you wanna stop me,
bring out some stronger guys!

111
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,420
What's wrong with these guys?!

112
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,870
C-Commodore Orlumbus!

113
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,740
You're in my way! Commodore...

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,330
...Hug!

115
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,430
Shoot Straw Hat!

116
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,120
Next, I'm gonna execute you!

117
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,890
--Why are they teaming up?!
--Execution is my repayment!

118
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,470
Wait, Hajrudin! If you kill Straw Hat,
you'll get a lot of money!

119
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,070
That's just a pittance!
I almost had my pride stolen

120
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,160
but was saved by God Usopp!

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,780
I can truly win my pride back,
only by repaying my debt!

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,190
--I will take down Doflamingo!
--No, I will!

123
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,540
--No, it's me!
--No, me!

124
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,950
I said it's me!

125
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,180
Cabbage!

126
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,830
I realized my destiny again.

127
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,140
I get a chance to bring down a Warlord.

128
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,460
I can get the better of
these annoying rookies all at once!

129
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,520
There'll be stories about me
in the newspapers everyday!

130
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm destined to be a top star!

131
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,470
"Ah! When Cavendish-sama is
on the front page of the newspaper,

132
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,490
it looks as gorgeous as a work of art!"

133
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,140
Oh yeah? How about having me on all pages,
not just the front page?

134
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,310
"That's a good idea!
Only you could come up with that!"

135
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,030
Well, the problem is
whether they can take a good picture of me.

136
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,100
Because I'm brighter than
a camera flash, so...!

137
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,390
--Go away!
--Shut up!

138
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,600
Good-bye!

139
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,810
Now! Shoot!

140
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,210
Blade of Beauty, Swan Lake!

141
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,020
Catch all the criminals and
bring an end to this game!

142
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,940
There they come!

143
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,140
What?!

144
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,280
--Go to sleep, weaklings!
--Do you want me to kick you to death first?!

145
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,250
--You guys are not strong enough!
--What?!

146
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,880
You need another 100 years of training to get strong enough
to repay your debt!

147
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,340
I will take down Doflamingo!

148
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,190
No, I'll take him down!
I'll get all the attention!

149
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,010
Let me return them the favor!

150
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,190
Don't follow me, I said! Go away!

151
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,860
--Back off, idiot!
--You back off, shithead!

152
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,870
Execution!

153
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,980
It's my chance!

154
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,750
It's not your chance!

155
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,890
It's my chance to become a top star!

156
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,890
I said "Go away"!

157
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,360
I will kick Mingo's ass!

158
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,090
What is wrong with these fools?!

159
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,810
Look up!

160
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,010
He's gonna throw another one!

161
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,830
Straw Hat!!

162
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,720
--How annoying!
--I'll take him down again and again!

163
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,340
Don't do it, guys!

164
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,260
Even if you break his arm again,
he can restore it!

165
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,940
If you can't figure out how his power works,
it's just a waste of your energy!

166
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,340
Then, what should we do?

167
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,760
You're a military tactician, aren't you?!
Can't you come up with some tactics?

168
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,450
I'd say...

169
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,640
I'd say...

170
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,090
Run!!

171
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,700
You're a tactician, aren't you?!
Come up with a better strategy!

172
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,030
Shut up!
Retreat is a viable strategy! Just run!

173
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,160
Dammit! This is nothing!

174
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,320
This is it! Prepare to be crushed to death!

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,950
Straw Hat!!

176
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,800
--It's impossible to run through him head on!
--Maybe, we should just take a detour!

177
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,060
He's really blocking our way!

178
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,470
We can't get to the Palace
unless we stop him!

179
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,480
Hey! Where did Straw Hat go?!

180
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,650
--I can't see him anywhere!
--Maybe he got crushed along with the bull!

181
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,490
Where are you, Straw Hat?!

182
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,090
What's that?!

183
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,530
There he is!

184
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,090
Yeehaw!

185
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,910
We're on the fast track! Yeah!

186
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,180
What?! He's climbing up his arm!

187
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,520
Keep going! Moocy!

188
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,430
--Can't believe it!
--Is he crazy?! That fool!

189
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,800
He's making a bigger scene than me!

190
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,990
I can't believe it!

191
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,500
Let's get to the Palace like this!

192
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,410
That's right! Run, bull, run!

193
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,630
Hey.

194
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,870
Yes?

195
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,700
--Cut the "Run, bull, run" crap!
--Yes?

196
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,590
--Get off! You're making it harder for Moocy to run!
--Oh, yes.

197
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,380
Excuse us for not introducing ourselves sooner.
I'm Jeet and the big guy behind me is...

198
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,830
I'm Abdullah.

199
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,290
--Did I ask your names?
--Whoa-whoa!

200
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,980
Take it easy, sir!

201
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,520
Hey!

202
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,690
I said "Get off"!

203
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,360
Straw Hat-san...

204
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
--Straw Hat!
--He's pissed!!

205
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,820
I won't let you go any closer to Doffy!

206
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,280
Oh! His arm!

207
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,360
Straw Hat! He has nowhere to hide
as long as he's on the giant's arm!

208
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,980
Straw Hat-san?!

209
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,960
Third Gear!

210
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,510
Armament Hardening!

211
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,270
It's massive! We're finished!

212
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,560
We have nowhere to run!

213
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,760
There comes the punch!

214
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,670
He can't ward it off in the air!
It's gonna hit him!

215
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,710
Straw Hat!

216
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,040
Gum-Gum...

217
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,820
...Grizzly Magnum!

218
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,560
He did it!

219
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,390
He's breaking apart?!

220
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,930
Pica-sama!

221
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,340
Yeah!

222
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,410
Those infamous strong men
who came out of the Colosseum are...

223
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,210
...heading to the Palace where Doflamingo is,
along with Straw Hat.

224
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,410
I see.

225
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:25,150
I knew those notorious scoundrels
wouldn't play by the rules but...

226
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,550
...I didn't expect them to join forces.

227
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,030
Excuse me.
Could I borrow that for a while?

228
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,910
What?

229
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,900
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

230
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,290
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring... Clank.

231
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,110
Vice Admiral Bastille!
There is an emergency call!

232
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,280
I can't answer them all at once-dara!

233
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,910
We keep getting calls from soldiers
who got blown away to distant places by Pica!

234
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,720
Vice Admiral Bastille!
There is an emergency call for you!

235
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,270
Who's that?! Can't this wait?!

236
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,440
I-It's... It's me.

237
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,340
I-Issho-san?!

238
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,340
Sir! How can I help you?! Where are you now?!

239
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,680
Tough competitors from the Colosseum

240
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,970
have allied and are on the move, I heard.

241
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,060
The whole town is in chaos now

242
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,340
and they're running wild
together! It's the worst-dara!

243
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,090
No, actually, it's favorable for us.

244
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,830
Wh-What do you mean-dara?!

245
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,470
Vice Admirals all over the island,
I need reinforcements as soon as possible.

246
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,920
It's time for us to take action.

247
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,810
Meet me at the foot of the Royal Palace!

248
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,830
There he is!

249
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,940
Show yourself, Kyros!

250
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,850
The game won't be over until
we catch all of you criminals!

251
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,220
I have a family!
I beg you! Let me catch you!

252
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,550
I still have a long way to go, to the palace!

253
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,060
Somebody, stop me!

254
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,400
I can't control my body!

255
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,340
I can't stand it anymore!

256
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,400
This must be a nightmare!

257
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,670
We have to relive the tragedy
from a decade ago?!

258
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,270
I will take back Dressrosa at any cost!

259
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,730
THE OLD KING'S PLATEAU

260
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,310
Guys!
We're almost there at the King's Plateau!

261
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,220
--Hurry up, everybody!
--We're almost there, Usoland!

262
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,890
--I'm counting on you all!
--Okay!

263
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,580
--Are you okay, Rebecca?
--Yes, I am, Robin-san!

264
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,250
What's wrong with that guy?

265
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm so pleased!

266
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,510
I'm being helped by
Robin-senpai's very hands now!

267
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,210
I feel like I'm dreaming!
I'm gonna climb up to the top gratefully!

268
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,300
Again, what's wrong with him?!

269
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,420
Nice! How nice! It's so soft! I'm so happy!

270
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,300
And I'll see Luffy-senpai \Nand Zoro-senpai up there!

271
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,710
We gotta kill all the criminals!

272
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,610
Everybody, hurry up! They're coming!

273
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,900
What?!

274
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,050
--We see a lot of money!
--Yeah!

275
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,370
Rebecca!

276
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,250
100 million!

277
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,410
Nico Robin!

278
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,590
100 million!

279
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,660
God Usopp!

280
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,290
500 million!

281
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,080
The total is...

282
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,670
700 million berries!
Let's go!

283
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,830
--Help!
--Climb up at full speed!

284
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,590
I got 100 million berries!

285
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,470
Dammit! Rebecca-sama!

286
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,810
Oh no!

287
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,180
--Slap!
--What?!

288
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,850
What the hell is this?!

289
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,450
I'm not gonna let you harm that girl!

290
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,910
Strong and beautiful!

291
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,960
Only Robin-senpai could do it!

292
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,210
Hey, Bartolomeo! Put up a barrier!

293
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,630
--Robin-senpai, you're the best!
--You're not listening!

294
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,970
--Are you okay, Rebecca-sama?
--Thank you!

295
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,280
--We're all here now, aren't we?
--Robin-san, there are still some pursuers!

296
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,480
Once we get to the top, they're all ours!

297
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,780
We're done with the net now.
We better put it away.

298
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh?

299
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,640
--Yes!
--Sorry.

300
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,460
Oh my Big Sis-sama!

301
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,360
Pica-sama!

302
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,220
--Only you could do it, Straw Hat-san!
--Thank you for your work!

303
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,940
Alright!
Let's go straight to the Palace!

304
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,990
Yes, sir!

305
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,030
No, I didn't say that to you guys!
I said it to Moocy!

306
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,750
Luffy! The head you just
shattered was just a stone!

307
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,750
What?!

308
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,620
What we're running on is just a stone shell!

309
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,160
We've lost him again?!

310
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,660
Where is he?

311
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,400
I know he hasn't gone far.

312
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,580
He looks pretty pissed!

313
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,700
What?! Where?! Where is he?!

314
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,420
His real body is right there!

315
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,160
I see something!

316
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,450
What?! That's the stone man?!

317
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,520
This is the first time we've seen him
in a human-like figure!

318
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,530
He has a massive sword!

319
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,550
Turn away!

320
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,360
If you can't turn away, stop!

321
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,990
It's too late!

322
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,740
The bull is flying!

323
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,690
After all, his voice is a riot!

324
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,680
Straw Hat!

325
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,780
Here he comes again!

326
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,100
--I'll see you later!
--What?!

327
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,650
Yeah, leave it up to me!

328
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,740
Cool!

329
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,540
Get out of my way!

330
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,900
Only friends of God himself could do this!

331
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,380
Zoro, I'm counting on you!

332
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,690
I'm gonna go kick Doflamingo's ass!

333
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,690
Got it, Captain!

334
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,890
I have business with Straw Hat! Go away!

335
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,780
Our captain has no business with
a worthless rock like you!

336
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,450
I'm all you've got. Live with it!

337
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,940
You soprano-voiced dumb-ass!

338
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,950
Zoro faces Pica, who has taken his true form!

339
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,620
All the battles involving the Straw Hats
and the others begin to intensify,

340
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,090
Law shares his true feelings,
which up until now have been a mystery!

341
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,690
The stunning truth about
the hostile relationship

342
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,550
between Doflamingo and
Law is finally revealed!

343
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:44,690
On the next episode of One Piece!
"A Shocking Confession! Law's Soulful Vow!"

344
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,320
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
