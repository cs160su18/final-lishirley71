Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,910
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,750
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,230
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,340
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything

32
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,510
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm sorry...

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,830
I wanted to carry you to further places.

36
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,790
I'm sorry...

37
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,840
I wanted to continue the
adventure together forever.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,720
Merry!

39
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,370
But I--

40
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,220
It's us who have to apologize, Merry!

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,960
I'm not good at steering...

42
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,710
...so I ran you into icebergs at times...

43
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,290
There was a time I tore the sails, too.

44
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,780
Zoro and Sanji are stupid,
so they broke all sorts of things!

45
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,460
Usopp would fix them each time,
but he isn't good at it!

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,630
So it's us who have to...

47
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,550
But I've been happy.

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,830
Thank you very much...
for taking good care of me.

49
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,730
I really have been happy...

50
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,970
...because I had you.

51
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,820
Merry!

52
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,770
"Two days later"

53
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,140
"Peace Interrupted! A Navy
Vice Admiral with a Fist of Love!"

54
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,980
--Yaay!
--Blue Station...

55
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,800
--Hurry! Hurry!
--Blue Station, Water Seven.

56
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,510
All passengers, please make sure not to
forget your belongings when you get off.

57
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,620
Forget the money. Just take it.
I wish you good luck!

58
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,200
This bites...

59
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,910
How're things over there?

60
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,510
No good, it's a total mess!

61
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,770
At any rate, this year's Aqua Laguna
was terribly destructive.

62
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,970
This is far beyond our
ability to repair on our own.

63
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,110
Hm? That's...

64
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,450
Paulie from Dock #1! What's he
doing in a backstreet like this?

65
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,950
Paulie-san!

66
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,540
Out of our way! You guys
stay away! You're in our way!

67
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,480
Guys from Dock #3! I'll leave this block to you!

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
Okay!

69
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,910
Guys from Dock #5! Take the block next to the
scrap heap island! Start with private houses!

70
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,720
Okay!

71
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,750
You've got your regular work, too!
So work on the backstreets

72
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,480
during your breaks! I want it
all restored within a month!

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,930
Got it!

74
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,160
Get on it!

75
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,940
Yeah!

76
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,830
Whoa! They're too dependable!

77
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,070
That's our Galley-La Company!

78
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,030
"Remains of Franky House, north shore"

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,750
This sure takes a lot of time to build.

80
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,560
Well, our specialty is demolition.

81
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,260
So we'll be camping out tonight again, huh?

82
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,670
There, there.

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,220
Sodom... and Gomorrah.

84
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,300
You two get a good rest, okay?

85
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,260
That reindeer guy said that Gomorrah's
eyes will get better if he keeps resting.

86
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,480
Is that right? That's good news!

87
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,150
Hey, guys. Give me a hand, will you?

88
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,090
I need to go pick up a shipment at the station.

89
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,210
A shipment?

90
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,690
Could it be...?

91
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,860
Yep. It seems like that stuff has arrived.

92
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:00,830
"Dock #1, shipbuilding island"

93
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,070
Let us see the pirates

94
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,600
and let us apologize to them

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,120
for calling them assassins!

96
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,540
You can't! The pirates won't see anyone!

97
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,410
We owe them for saving Iceberg-san's life.
Let us at least thank them!

98
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm from the Water Seven Newspaper!

99
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,720
Let me have some comments from the
heroes who saved our mayor! Please!

100
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,680
Just give up! You can't see them now!

101
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,910
Let us at least take their pictures, then!

102
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,760
--I said no! Are you all deaf?!
--I'll work as a secretary in place of Kalifa-san!

103
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,000
Let me do something to help!

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,810
Let us see the pirates!

105
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,680
No means no means no!

106
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,140
Amazing! They've got
unbelievable superhuman strength!

107
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,420
Is this how you want it?

108
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,850
Thank you! That's giants for you!

109
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,870
If we can do something like this
to help, just let us know any time!

110
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,020
You guys really are great!

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,880
Say, king of snipers...

112
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,590
Hm?

113
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,390
Is it okay for you to stay here?

114
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,100
What?

115
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,270
We were thinking...

116
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:11,150
If our bosses are still fighting,
we can't set foot on that island.

117
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,050
So we decided to help out
the guys on this island a bit

118
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,130
and then take our time going back to Elbaf.

119
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,270
If you like Elbaf, we can take you with us.

120
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,620
I...

121
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,960
Where I'm going is my own business.

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,500
I'm... leaving the gang!

123
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,090
Fight a duel with me!

124
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,000
I...

125
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,600
"Remains of Galley-La Company headquarters--
Iceberg's residence"

126
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,230
"Temporary headquarters building"

127
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,230
I see... So you burned the blueprints...

128
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,910
That's for the best.

129
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,690
You made an enemy of
the government too, huh?

130
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,860
Guess I did.

131
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,580
So... what are those plans
you've been drawing up?

132
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,640
Seeing the scale of this past Aqua Laguna

133
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,940
must have made the citizens worry

134
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,540
that this island itself might be
swallowed by the sea some time soon.

135
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,510
Well, if something like that keeps attacking,

136
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,860
the island might sink, too.

137
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,390
So what're you gonna do?

138
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,850
I'll have the entire island float on the sea.

139
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,110
What?!

140
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,020
Turn Water Seven into a ship?!

141
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,530
But i-is something like that possible?!

142
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,990
Did you forget...?

143
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,850
We witnessed a great man who
made the impossible possible

144
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,000
for quite some time, didn't we?

145
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,160
If you're a man... do it resolutely!

146
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,050
"If you're a man, do it resolutely," huh?

147
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,010
Now I remember.

148
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,470
You're right.

149
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,300
Hm?

150
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,270
--Click.
--Hello?!

151
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,050
Oh, is this Bro?

152
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,970
Oh, hey, Zambai! What's up?

153
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,070
Please rejoice, Bro! It's finally here!

154
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,150
It's just arrived by sea train!

155
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,630
The item that you purchased
for 200 million Berries!

156
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,870
So it's finally arrived...

"Special pirate room with kitchen and bathroom,
temporary headquarters building"

Hey! I'm coming in!

161
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,810
And you kids...

162
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,470
Ribbit! Ribbit?!

163
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,140
Ribbit!

164
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,690
You stay outside.

165
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Ribbit, ribbit.

166
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,370
Looks like everyone's finally woken up, huh?
You guys slept for two days.

167
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,330
You must've been quite exhausted...
of course, it's only natural after everything.

168
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,150
Oh? The King of the Pirates
is doing pretty good, too, huh?

169
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,570
Oh... It's not like that.

170
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,080
What do you mean?

171
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,670
Because he doesn't want to collapse
and miss any meals after fights...

172
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,590
Huh?

173
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,000
...he said he acquired the skill
of eating while sleeping.

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,560
He's actually sleeping?!

175
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,010
Amazing! Pirate guy!

176
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,430
What a skillful man!

177
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,600
Ribbit...

178
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,750
By the way, the Log for the Log Pose
should be ready in 2-3 days, right?

179
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,030
Hey, what's going on over here?!

180
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,870
Even if the Log is ready,
we can't move forward for a while.

181
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,680
The whole 100 million Berries
we saved to buy a new ship,

182
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,210
our clothes, furniture, and Bellemere-san's
tangerine trees... Everything...

183
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,660
...was swept away by the Aqua Laguna.

184
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,550
We can no longer go anywhere.

185
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,260
How gloomy...

186
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,570
We entrusted them all
with a backstreet inn, so...

187
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,520
Then I wonder if the visitors outside
have something to do with that...

188
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,020
Visitors?

189
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,270
--Excuse me...
--Hm?

190
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,010
Actually, we came to deliver these.

191
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,990
Hm?

192
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,320
Tangerine trees! I thought
I'd never get them back!

193
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm so glad!

194
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,470
Well, when we were chasing you guys
around as Iceberg-san's assassins,

195
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,230
we confiscated everything as
pirates' belongings. Sorry about that.

196
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,420
Not at all! Thank you!

197
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,900
I'm happy for you.

198
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,140
Hey! We're back!

199
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,460
--We're back.
--Hey, Chopper! And Robin-chan!

200
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,810
It must've been heavy. Now, give me your hand.

201
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,810
Thank you.

202
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,590
I went to check on the
Franky Family guys' injuries.

203
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,270
Also, I didn't take my eyes off of Robin!

204
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,670
Okay! Well done!

205
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,360
Yep!

206
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,110
I told you, I'm not going anywhere.

207
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,720
It's a promise, okay?!

208
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,150
Yes, it's a promise.

209
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,030
Both of you! Look at this!

210
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,140
The tangerine trees were okay!

211
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,180
We got everything back,
including our money and belongings!

212
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,090
Yeah!

213
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,970
We can now continue our journey!

214
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,210
All right! I'm so glad!

215
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,090
Hm?

216
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,050
Yow! Are you guys super?! Everyone...

217
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,760
...isn't here, but that's okay.

218
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,080
What is it, Franky, all of a sudden?!

219
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,060
Listen!

220
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,020
I've got something important
to discuss with you.

221
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,500
On an island where wars
happen one after another...

222
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,120
What is it all of a sudden?

223
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,010
You just barged in here. If it's a
stupid story, we're not gonna listen.

224
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,140
Shut up! Just listen to my story!

225
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,020
No matter if the islanders start a war
where cannonballs fall incessantly,

226
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,980
or if everyone dies and the town
also dies and turns to ruins...

227
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,440
...this huge tree would continue to stand.

228
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,930
No matter what happens, this tree will not fall.

229
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,950
People once again nestle close to that
tree and create a town... A country.

230
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,410
Only a few trees like this exist in the world.

231
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,120
The name given to the strongest of all trees is...

232
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,840
..."Adam," the treasure tree.

233
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,300
A tree?

234
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,920
What about the tree?

235
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,760
Its wood appears on the
black market on rare occasions.

236
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,890
I wanted it... but it cost almost 200 million.

237
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,360
So it was impossible for me to buy it.

238
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,420
And then, there appeared pirates with
a lot of money--in other words, you guys.

239
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,240
You jerk! You'd better not have bought
something like that with our money!

240
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,740
Just keep listening!

241
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,710
A long time ago, I made the decision
that I'd never again build a ship.

242
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,590
But I wanted to catch up to the
person who was my goal after all.

243
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,260
The next thing I knew, I was
drawing blueprints for a ship.

244
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,890
My dream is... to use that treasure tree...

245
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,900
...to build one last ship...
A dream ship that crosses any sea!

246
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,870
I've already obtained this treasure tree.

247
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,120
I've already got blueprints, too.

248
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,460
I'm going to build this ship now.

249
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,880
So... when it's completed...

250
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:14,670
...will you set sail on the ship I've built?!

251
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,640
What?

252
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,480
What? What? Th-Then...

253
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,100
Then... a-are you going to give that ship to us?!

254
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,280
That's right. Nothing would make me happier
than for people I like to travel on my ship.

255
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,030
Well, that, and it's kinda like you
gave me the money for it, so...

256
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,460
The Oro Jackson, the ship of Gold Roger,
the only man who completed

257
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,120
the round-the-world journey,
was also built using this treasure tree.

258
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,830
I swear... I'll build an incredible ship!

259
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,770
I guess it can't be helped, huh?

260
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,510
Tom-san and you are both craftsmen after all.

261
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,140
Yeah... Now...

262
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:14,070
Now... I can understand the feelings
of Tom-san, who died with pride.

263
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,030
All right!

264
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,270
--You're a nice guy! We'll take it!
Thank you, Franky!
--Ribbit, ribbit! Ribbit, ribbit...

265
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,830
All right! We can travel to the next island!

266
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,040
Oh, I'm so happy! Luffy!
We're gonna get a ship!

267
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,460
Ribbit!

268
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,970
This is bad. To think that they figured
out our whereabouts this soon...

269
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,530
And Luffy's still sleeping!

270
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,640
I have to let them know immediately!

271
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,770
What?!

272
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,060
Sea...?

273
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,490
Crap! I went the opposite way!

274
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,300
What?! Sea again?! Dammit!

275
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,430
Give me a break! Is this island a maze?!

276
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,930
This is terrible. They came
to capture the pirates.

277
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,350
They saved Iceberg-san's life!

278
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,350
Hey, take a good look at that!

279
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,440
That battleship belongs to
Vice Admiral Garp from headquarters!

280
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,320
Garp, you said?!

281
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,360
That's the legendary marine who
cornered Gold Roger many times!

282
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,010
Why did such a high-level marine come?

283
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,330
Aren't the pirates in big trouble?!

284
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,180
Enough already...
Why the heck am I here again?

285
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,390
Dammit! Why's this gotta happen when
I have to let them know right away?!

286
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,000
Hey, there's an idiot over there.

287
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,270
Let's do it.

288
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,280
Hey, pops! We haven't
seen your face around here.

289
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,610
We want to have a word with you.

290
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,990
Oh, yeah?

291
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,220
P-Please hold on a second, marines!

292
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,300
--Our president is the only one back there.
--Shut up! There've got to be pirates!

293
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,880
N-No, there aren't!
Hey, don't enter without permission!

294
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,890
Stop! The Straw Hats are--!

295
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,060
Idiot!

296
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
You two, wait here!

297
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,320
Yes, sir!

298
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,810
What the hell?!

299
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,390
Who's there?!

300
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,400
So you guys are the Straw Hats?!

301
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,400
I've got some guys who I want
to have meet Monkey D. Luffy.

302
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,280
Navy!

303
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,120
Geez... He's as hopeless as ever.

304
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,500
What?!

305
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,250
Dammit!

306
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,830
Wake up!

307
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,010
Luffy!

308
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,220
O-Ouch! That hurt!

309
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,000
That hurt?! What're you saying?!

310
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,660
That was a punch! There's no
way that'd work on rubber!

311
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,910
There's no means to ward off a fist of love!

312
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,360
Looks like you've gone on
quite the rampage, huh, Luffy?

313
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,940
Ack! G-G-G...

314
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,650
Grandpa!

315
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,510
What?

316
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,830
What?!

317
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,040
A-A Navy Vice Admiral is...

318
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,090
His grandpa?!

319
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,130
Hold on a sec!

320
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,940
Luffy's grandpa is a Navy hero?!
