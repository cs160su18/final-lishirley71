00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
Take those two and beat it already

20
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,190
while you're still alive, you small fries!

21
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,180
The sky island exists.

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,150
Zoro!

23
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,140
Luffy!

24
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,160
The new era they're talking about is crap!

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,010
The era where pirates have dreams
will be over, they say?! Huh?!

26
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,050
People's dreams... have no end!!

27
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,160
"Legendary Family! 'Noland the Liar'"

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,900
Seriously... Seriously... Seriously...

29
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,820
Seriously... that darn orangutan!
He wrecked the ship even more!

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,090
This ship has really started to fall apart.
Maybe it's about time to replace it?

31
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,840
Don't you dare start saying
inconsiderate things, too!

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,180
Don't you dare!

33
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,410
You know exactly how we got this ship, right?!

34
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,010
Right?!

35
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,170
I know, Usopp.
Complaining won't get us anywhere.

36
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,050
Going Merry is an important part of the team.

37
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,750
You know exactly...!

38
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,410
You...! You...!

39
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,840
So let's work hard and repair the ship!

40
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,390
How we... How... How... How we...!

41
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,390
Luffy... You're such a...

42
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,400
Whoops.

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,540
You idiot!! Are you repairing
the ship or wrecking it?!

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,870
Well, I'm really trying to fix it, but...

45
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,210
Whoops, it got broke again.

46
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,810
Luffy!!

47
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,800
We left Mock Town and headed east
by circling around the island.

48
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,250
We're almost here on the map.

49
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,730
That man... what's his name again?

50
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,960
Montblanc Cricket.

51
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,170
So that man who talks of
dreams lives there, huh?

52
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,010
A-Amazing!!

53
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,200
That's his house?! That's a palace!

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,970
Is this Montblanc Cricket guy mega-rich?!

55
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,870
Idiots! Look closely.

56
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,850
A dreamer, huh? He does seem to be vain.

57
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,080
Why?

58
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,590
What the...?! It's just a board?!

59
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,420
What?!

60
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,750
The actual house is only half of it.
The rest is just a veneer.

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,900
He seems like a very cheap guy.

62
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,830
What kind of dreams did he talk about
that would get him driven out?

63
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,930
I don't know the details,

64
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,890
but I heard that he said a huge
amount of gold rests in Jaya.

65
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,940
Gold?!

66
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,340
Is that some pirate's buried
treasure or something?

67
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,690
Well, I don't know.

68
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,110
Gold!!

69
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,650
Dig the ground, Chopper! Gold will appear!

70
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,060
It will if I dig?

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,650
Living alone in such a remote area?

72
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,500
Hello. I'm coming in.

73
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,640
Couldn't you wait a moment?!

74
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,010
Hm? No one's here. Hello!!

75
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,600
No answer...

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,330
You idiot, wait! What're you
gonna do if this guy's dangerous?

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,270
Hey, everyone! No one's home!

78
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,200
Hm? This is...

79
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,620
...a picture book.

80
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,610
This is quite an old book.

81
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,330
Hm? It's titled "Noland the Liar."

82
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,600
Wow, that's a cool title! Nice idea for a book!

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
"Noland the Liar"?

84
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,310
You know it, Sanji-kun? But it says
it was published in the North Blue.

85
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,520
Yeah. I was born in the North Blue.

86
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,270
Haven't I told you guys?

87
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,500
That's news. I thought you
were from the East, too.

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,590
I grew up there.

89
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,820
Quiet, Chopper! What're you doing?!

90
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,730
What?!

91
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:09,180
"Noland the Liar"

92
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,460
This is a famous story in the North.

93
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,750
It's a fairy tale, but I've heard that this
Noland guy actually existed long ago.

94
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,720
This is a story from long, long ago...

95
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,500
A story that took place 400 long years ago.

96
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,740
A man named Montblanc Noland
lived in a North Blue country.

97
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,380
Noland, an explorer, always talked
about his incredible adventures.

98
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,340
However, the villagers couldn't tell
if those stories were true or not.

99
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,100
One day, he reported to the King
after coming back from his travels.

100
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,870
"I saw a mountain of gold
on an island in the great sea."

101
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,310
The courageous king set sail to the
great sea to see if the story was true,

102
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,250
taking 2,000 soldiers along with him.

103
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,960
After surviving great storms
and battling against monsters,

104
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:07,340
only the King, Noland and 100
soldiers made it to the island.

105
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,200
However, what they found
there was just a jungle.

106
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,560
In the end, he was sentenced
to death for the crime of lying.

107
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,070
Noland's last words were as follows:

108
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,340
"That's right! The mountain
of gold sank in the sea!"

109
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,500
The King and the others were dumbfounded.

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,730
No one believed Noland any longer

111
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,350
because Noland continued
to lie until his very death.

112
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,240
This book is based on the North Blue
fairy tale "Noland the Liar."

113
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,370
Montblanc Cricket is a descendant
of that Montblanc Noland?!

114
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,450
I heard that fairy tale a lot when I was a kid.

115
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,810
There isn't anyone in the North Blue
who doesn't know the tale.

116
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,460
We're all from the North Blue,
so we often got told

117
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,450
that if we lied a lot, we'd be
sentenced to death like Noland.

118
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,460
This is getting more and more interesting!

119
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,970
I never would've imagined that
Jaya was the island in that fairy tale.

120
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,800
And, after 400 years,
a descendant of Noland the Liar

121
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,180
is looking for the gold on this island, huh?

122
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,410
In order to clear the name of his ancestor,

123
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,040
who was called a big liar
and laughed at until he died...

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,010
This family cracks me up!

125
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,640
Does he really think that
he can clear the name

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,650
of his 400 year-old ancestor by
bringing back a few pieces of gold?!

127
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,260
Sounds like he's weak in the head!

128
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,400
Alas, the liar died...

129
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,170
...before he could even become
a brave warrior on the sea.

130
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,670
Don't look at me! And don't add in a
heartbreaking sentence on your own!

131
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,670
Luffy fell into the sea!!

132
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,530
What're you doing?!

133
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,050
Who the hell are you?!

134
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,800
You've got guts, relaxing at someone's
house without permission!

135
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,020
The sea in this area is my turf!

136
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,220
Hey, Usopp! Go grab Luffy!

137
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,560
Got it!

138
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,450
You're after the gold, aren't you? Die!

139
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,150
Sanji!!

140
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,920
Sanji-kun!

141
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,250
Don't worry. It didn't hit me.

142
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,090
Hold on!

143
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,540
Idiot... You shouldn't
underestimate your opponent.

144
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,550
Move! I'll handle this!

145
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,710
Hey, what were you doing?!

146
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,020
I saw... bubbles coming out of the water.

147
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,470
So I was looking in the water,
then suddenly a chestnut appeared.

148
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,840
The chestnut was actually a guy,
and he dragged me into the water.

149
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,060
Hey, old guy!

150
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,090
Bring more cold towels! Open up the windows!

151
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,650
Caisson disease?

152
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,600
Is this guy sick?

153
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,470
Yeah, it's a sickness that divers sometimes get.

154
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,790
But it doesn't usually become
a longstanding condition.

155
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,780
Due to a lack of decompression
when surfacing from the seabed,

156
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,460
the nitrogen dissolved in the
blood gets released quickly

157
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,850
and forms gas bubbles at that time.

158
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,650
Since the gas bubbles expand
inside and outside of blood vessels,

159
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,280
they cause problems to
blood flow, muscle and joints.

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,570
So it's some bizarre phenomenon, huh?

161
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,680
He probably kept diving
every day without giving time

162
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,340
for those bubbles to disappear from the body.

163
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,670
What for?!

164
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,820
I don't know, but he's taking a risk.

165
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,730
In some cases, caisson disease can...

166
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,000
...cause death.

167
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,660
Oh hey, it's you, Masira. So you're alive.

168
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,330
Alive? What're you talking about?

169
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,670
Never mind. In any case,
what was that gunfire about?

170
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,670
Exactly, brother! Do you think
something happened to the old-timer?

171
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,730
Let's hurry! I'm getting all worked up!

172
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,620
Old-timer! Are you all right?!

173
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,680
They've come to kill us!!

174
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,050
What're you guys doing here?!

175
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,760
What did you do to the old-timer?!

176
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,720
What? We're looking after this guy
right now, so go somewhere else.

177
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,730
Idiot! They aren't really gonna hear us out!

178
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,940
They're savages, you know!

179
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,780
You know!

180
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,920
Everyone, evacuate through the windows!

181
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,920
You...

182
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,240
...guys are so nice!

183
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,030
They're listening!

184
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,450
You guys live here, too?

185
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,680
Well, the old-timer's house is the
headquarters of the Saruyama Alliance.

186
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,420
But we sleep on our ships most of the time

187
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,170
because this house is too small for us.

188
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,420
It's because you guys are too big.

189
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,350
Well, to those Giant guys you
look like a ball of earwax, though.

190
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,070
Why are they getting along so well?

191
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,320
They can probably relate to each other.

192
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,900
But it's amazing that you guys
kicked him off when you're so small!

193
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,630
Really? You can do it, too.

194
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,780
Oh, really?

195
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, you can because you're a monkey.

196
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,560
Luffy, he's come around!

197
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,000
He's awake?!

198
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,930
Hey, he's right, I can kick Masira...

199
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,510
Hey old diamond-head!
I wanna ask you something!

200
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,410
Sorry I caused you trouble.

201
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,080
I thought you were just
more idiots after the gold.

202
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
What?! You have gold bullion?

203
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,020
Don't go after it.

204
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,780
What is it that you wanna ask me?

205
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,260
Old guy, we wanna go to the sky island!
Please tell us how to get there!

206
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,640
Sky island?

207
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,180
You guys believe in the sky island?

208
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,060
Hey, stop it! He's a sick person!

209
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,000
There's no sky island, old guy?!

210
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,470
No one knows.

211
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,750
I know someone who said there is.

212
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,940
But people call him a legendary big liar!

213
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,380
His family became a laughing stock forever.

214
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,300
It's not me!

215
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,640
There's an old story that
most North Blue people know.

216
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,280
"Noland the Liar" is the one.

217
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,080
Like I said, it's not me!
He's got a different name, right?!

218
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,470
Come to think of it, Noland's name is,
if I'm not mistaken, Montblanc Noland.

219
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,490
Could it be that you're Noland's...

220
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,420
A descendant?! Could this place
be the island in that story?!

221
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,150
Hmph! He's my granddad's
granddad's granddad's...

222
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,030
He's my distant ancestor... What a nuisance.

223
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,310
I doubt there's a drop
of his blood in my body...

224
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,660
Although the Montblanc family
was driven out of the country then,

225
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,170
and has kept a low profile,

226
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,080
people continue to
denounce our family to this day.

227
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,020
But no one in the family hates him.

228
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,100
Why?

229
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,620
Because Noland was an
extraordinarily honest person.

230
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,600
But in that picture book...

231
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,570
Noland's last excuse in
the picture book is like this.

232
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,010
"That's right! The mountain
of gold sank in the sea!"

233
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,560
A stupid-looking face is drawn in this book...

234
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,750
...but he shed many tears
and died a regrettable death.

235
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,460
He was sure that the island
he reached was Jaya,

236
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,360
where he found the wreckage of a city of gold.

237
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,300
He felt that there was no way
it was just an illusion.

238
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,780
Noland insisted that the ruins had
submerged due to crustal movements,

239
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,590
but everyone thought he was
making excuses out of desperation.

240
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,800
Noland was executed in front
of the laughing onlookers,

241
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,440
and only the name "Liar" remained.

242
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,710
Oh, I see! You're looking for
the city of gold on the seabed

243
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,920
in order to clear the Montblanc family's name!

244
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,170
Don't be silly!

245
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,220
Usopp!!

246
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,700
I thought I'd die...

247
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,450
How honest my distant ancestor was,

248
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,660
or how great an explorer he was,
has nothing to do with me!

249
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,750
Can you understand how a kid would
feel being laughed at by strangers

250
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,280
just because he's the
descendant of such an idiot?!

251
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,890
That's how I grew up!

252
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:22,340
But... yeah, over the past 400 years,
many set sail to restore our family's honor,

253
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,500
though all of them went missing.

254
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,800
I was ashamed of such a family.

255
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,930
I ran away from home and became a pirate.

256
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,600
Oh? You're a pirate, too?

257
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,000
It's not that I wanted to become a pirate.

258
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,960
I just wanted to escape from Noland's spell.

259
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,730
And over time, I came to
have my own pirate group.

260
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,320
At long last, I entered the Grand Line,

261
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,420
and I spent all my time on adventures.

262
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,940
But ten years ago, my ship
reached this island by accident.

263
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,740
Strangely enough, only I,

264
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,890
who continued to hate the Montblanc
family and Noland the most, made it here.

265
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,220
The island didn't have a city of gold,
just like the picture book said.

266
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,010
As I stood on a cape of the island,
I felt that it was destiny.

267
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,620
There was no place to escape to.

268
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,400
Let's settle this, Noland!

269
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,760
Hell, no! Captain, we're not gonna have
anything to do with your family's problem!

270
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,870
If you insist on searching
for the gold, do it alone!

271
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,920
We're splitting here. Goodbye, Captain.

272
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,610
If it's there, that's fine.
If it's not there, that's fine, too.

273
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,290
It's not that I want to prove his innocence.

274
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,660
This is a duel with the man
who threw a wrench into my life.

275
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,260
I want to set the record straight before I die.

276
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,480
This is indeed a man's...

277
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,040
Then, what about them?
Why are those monkeys, here?

278
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,270
There must've been an exciting drama

279
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,000
spoken with the fists of men
committed to exploring the seabed.

280
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,390
Those guys are fans of the picture book.

281
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,350
Fans?!

282
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,010
That's a quite simple connection.

283
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,950
I think it was five or six years ago.

284
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,520
They heard a rumor about
me and barged in on me.

285
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,570
They said, "We think
Noland's gold definitely exists!"

286
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,170
Shojo!

287
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,390
Are you ready to take me on
after suddenly kicking me like that?!

288
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,390
Hey, that's an outrageous
false accusation, Masira!

289
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,330
Don't make me angry!

290
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,910
The sea around here is deep.

291
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,790
In the dark, cold sea, you're
haunted by a deeper solitude.

292
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,920
I just dived and searched alone every day.

293
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,600
They just came into my life

294
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,520
and became my underlings without
my permission, and they romp around.

295
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,920
Single-minded idiots like them...
make me feel relieved, to be honest.

296
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,940
Do you understand?

297
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,630
I do. Yeah, real comrades give
each other strength and...

298
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,400
Well, putting the story
about those monkeys aside...

299
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,660
Then, don't ask! Clench your teeth!

300
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,100
Like I said... I wanna go
to the sky island, old guy!

301
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,290
You're a hasty one!

302
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:36,790
Yeah, I did tell you, right? The witness
to the sky island is that Noland the Liar.

303
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,300
If you have anything to do with him,
you'll be laughed at like me.

304
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,930
What?! He's been to the sky island, too?!

305
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,060
Unfortunately, this doesn't say he did, but...

306
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,470
A logbook?! Could it be Noland's?

307
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,530
That's right.

308
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,820
Read around there.

309
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,870
Amazing... A logbook from 400 years ago...

310
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,230
Sea Ephemeris Year 1120, June 21st, Sunny.

311
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,420
We left Villa, a cheerful town.

312
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,950
Following the Log Pose, we should be
heading east-northeast from the harbor.

313
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,520
We got a rare item from a bumboat
that we came across during the day.

314
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,850
It's a ski-like one-person boat called a waver.

315
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,290
It's a mysterious boat that can generate wind
and move even on a day without wind.

316
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,250
It seems that you need to get the hang
of it to ride, and I couldn't manage it.

317
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,950
Right now, it's become
a perfect toy for my crew.

318
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,870
No way! What's this? I want it!

319
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,110
Never mind that, keep reading!!

320
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,210
The power for this seems to be a
product found only on the sky island,

321
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,620
and I hear that many peculiar
things like that exist in the sky.

322
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:46,070
Speaking of the sky island, one of my
explorer friends showed me a live skyfish.

323
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,920
I was surprised at how strange the fish looked.

324
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,970
Skyfish?

325
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,260
To our ship, it's still an unknown area,

326
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,180
but as a sailor, I'd like to go
to the sea in the sky one day.

327
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,690
Montblanc Noland...

328
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,110
He said "the sea in the sky"!

329
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,080
It's just like Robin said!!

330
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,110
And it sounds like the sky island was a
pretty normal thing for people back them.

331
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,760
So it really does exist!

332
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,710
Alright!!

333
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,730
Hey, old-timer! How are you feeling?!

334
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,650
Couldn't be better!

335
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,530
Glad to hear it!

336
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,920
Old-timer, this bastard...

337
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,690
Shut up and listen. Do you like those guys?

338
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,950
Why do you ask?

339
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,930
It seems like they wanna go
to the sky island at any cost.

340
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,620
Sky island... If they wanna go,
there's only one way to get there.

341
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,980
If they try on their own, they'll get
killed immediately, old-timer.

342
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,200
Exactly... so why don't we give them a hand?

343
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,850
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

344
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:27,910
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

345
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:43,840
There are days where I almost lose to myself

346
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:52,260
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

347
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,390
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

348
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:08,740
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

349
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,580
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

350
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,710
This unique moment...

351
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,640
We can finally go to the sky! To the sky!!

352
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,790
I wonder what kind of place the sky island is!

353
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm so excited!

354
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,550
It's an adventure befitting me, Captain Usopp!

355
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,480
But it'll be a life-threatening voyage.

356
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,240
Yeah, it'll be a life-threatening...
What? Hey, Luffy, let's forget about it.

357
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,800
You...!

358
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,400
"Steer for the Clouds! Capture the South Bird!"

360
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,890
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
