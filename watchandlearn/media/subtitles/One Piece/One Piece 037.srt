2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,710
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,080
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,660
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,380
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,860
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,970
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,780
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,140
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,890
What's wrong, girlie?

25
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,170
Do you want me to return
the village that badly?

26
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,390
Then how's this?
Let's make an agreement.

27
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,800
Agreement?

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,110
That's right.

29
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,120
Gather up 100 million
Berries and bring it here.

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,140
Do so and I'll let the village
go and give you freedom.

31
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,350
Honest?!

32
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,290
Honest!

33
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,690
I'd die before I break an
agreement concerning money.

34
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,600
It doesn't matter how
many years it takes.

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
I'll honor our agreement.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,670
I absolutely will save up
100 million Berries!

37
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,530
Bellemere-san! I will do it!

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,630
No matter how much time it takes!

39
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,220
"Luffy Rises!
Result of the Broken Promise!"

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,250
Gen-san? And the navy?

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,480
Are you the girl thief known as Nami?

42
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,350
Our information has it you've hidden
treasure you stole from pirates.

43
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,660
The government hereby confiscates
all the property you have stolen!

44
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,010
What's the matter?
Did you not hear me?

45
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,630
The government
hereby takes possession

46
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,680
of everything you
stole from the pirates.

47
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,230
My, my. You're very passionate
about your duties, I see.

48
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,510
You're not brave enough
to stand up to pirates,

49
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,810
so you deal with sneak thieves
instead to earn brownie points.

50
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,680
Talk about superb!

51
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,820
Here's a warning for you.

52
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,990
I'm a leader of the Arlong Pirates.

53
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,070
Mess with me, and Arlong
won't sit by quietly!

54
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,440
Silly girl. Do you think you're
dealing with me on equal footing?

55
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,120
Find the stolen goods!

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,010
Wait!

57
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,870
Stop!

58
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,860
Is this what the navy
should be doing right now?!

59
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,760
The Arlong Pirates have killed people,
and even destroyed towns!

60
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,700
You know that!

61
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,330
He's ruling over this island and
trampling all over people's lives!

62
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,960
Is ignoring that major problem

63
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,300
and raking in stolen goods from a thief

64
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,500
what the government stands for?!

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Don't talk all big.

66
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,490
Continue your search!

67
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,450
People all over the island've been
waiting for your help for years now!

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,960
How dare you just pass
them by and come here!

69
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,080
Colonel! This tangerine
orchard seems suspicious!

70
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,930
Dig it up!

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,430
Keep your filthy hands off of
Bellemere-san's tangerine orchard!

72
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,290
I won't let you have my money!

73
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,350
That money's for...
That money's for...

74
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,620
This girl's money is meant
to save Cocoyashi Village!

75
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,860
What gives you the right
to take it away, navy man?!

76
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,830
Oh? A lowly village representative,
talking down to a navy colonel?

77
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,950
Gen-san... How do you know about that?

78
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,000
I've always known, Nami.

79
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm... joining...

80
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,650
Eh?

81
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,110
I'm joining... the Arlong Pirates...

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,950
Nami!

83
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,980
You...

84
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,970
Nami...

85
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,040
I couldn't believe
what you'd done then,

86
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,940
so I confronted Nojiko later.

87
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,410
Everyone in the village
has known since then

88
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,960
that you stayed with the Arlong
Pirates so you could save the village.

89
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,250
But we pretended we didn't know.

90
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,090
Because our hopes would keep you
from running away from Arlong

91
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,410
if you ever decided to.

92
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,410
You can't be serious...

93
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,060
What on earth are you talking about?

94
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,500
You're saying all the
villagers are thieves,

95
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,770
and we should arrest them?

96
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,060
He's saying that each and every
one of us is fighting to live!

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,390
But only because we can't rely
on any of you government people!

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,850
If you're not gonna save our village,
then get the hell out of here!

99
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,590
Dilly-dally and Arlong'll
go after your ship, too!

100
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,460
Mr. Arlong will?
I wouldn't be so sure...

101
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,270
You still haven't found it?!

102
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,640
We're looking for 100 million
Berries here! Not a grain of rice!

103
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,080
Hey, you! How do you
know how much there is?!

104
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,980
Oh, the 100 million?

105
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,320
I just got the feeling
there's that much.

106
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,520
Don't tell me he...

107
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,150
Don't tell me Arlong sent you here!

108
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,500
Who knows?

109
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,710
We're simply dealing with theft
as any government workers would.

110
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,380
What rotten scum!

111
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,090
I can't believe the navy would
stoop to being pirate cronies!

112
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,840
Arlong!

113
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,450
I found it!

114
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,840
This is incredible!

115
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm impressed you could
gather this much, girl!

116
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,570
It's all ragged and stained with blood...

117
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,570
No matter! Money is money!

118
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,540
Thirty percent of this is all mine!

119
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,420
Don't touch that...

120
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,030
Don't touch that... Don't touch that...

121
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Nami...

122
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,080
Don't touch that... Don't touch that...

123
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,710
Don't touch that!

124
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,770
Nami!

125
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,920
Nojiko!

126
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,420
Nojiko!!

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,710
A pinwheel, huh?

128
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,820
Man, that was so cool!

129
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,510
I thought up a good move!

130
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,390
Doctor! Doctor!

131
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,480
What is it, Gen-san?!

132
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,880
Nojiko's been shot!

133
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,110
By who?!

134
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,270
The navy!

135
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,160
The navy?

136
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,360
Nojiko!

137
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm fine...

138
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,260
Arlong's been working with the navy.

139
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,090
What?!

140
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,230
He's lied to Nami
for the last eight years.

141
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,590
He never intended to
honor their agreement!

142
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,870
--What?!
--Oh, no! Then...

143
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,630
--What?!
--Oh, no! Then...

144
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,240
That bastard!
He lied to our Nacchan!

145
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Nacchan!

146
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,560
Nami...

147
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,110
Heya, Nami! What's up?
Need help with anything?

148
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,930
Are you still here?!

149
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,450
This has nothing to do with you!
Leave the damn island already!

150
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,850
Arlong... Arlong...!

151
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,570
Arlong!

152
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,210
I'd die before I break an
agreement concerning money.

153
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,410
It doesn't matter how
many years it takes.

154
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,090
I'll honor our agreement.

155
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,260
Arlong!

156
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,980
What's her problem?

157
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,110
Arlong!

158
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,040
Oh? What's wrong,
skilled surveyor of ours?

159
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,100
Why the angry look?

160
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,000
The navy men you have under
your control stole all my money!

161
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,020
What happened to dying before
breaking promises about money?!

162
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,460
Why?!

163
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,710
When did I break our promise?

164
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,190
Don't play dumb!
You teamed up with the navy to--

165
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,970
When did I break our
promise? Let's hear it!

166
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,040
Damn you... Damn you! Damn you!

167
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,980
I see! So your money's been stolen?

168
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,520
How unfortunate.

169
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,040
But an agreement is an agreement.

170
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,860
If you can't gather up
100 million Berries for me to see,

171
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,830
I'm afraid I can't give
you the village back.

172
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,470
Scum!

173
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,930
It's only 100 million Berries!
Just start saving up again!

174
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,200
Or are you gonna run out on me?

175
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,690
But if you do run away, I'll kill
everyone in Cocoyashi Village.

176
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,260
Nami...

177
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,120
We pretended we didn't know.

178
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,460
Because our hopes would keep you
from running away from Arlong

179
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,810
if you ever decided to.

180
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,530
Oh? Finally running away, huh?

181
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
Shouldn't we chase after her?

182
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,620
Chase? What for? She won't run away.

183
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,370
She could never abandon
the lives of the villagers.

184
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,090
You certainly do know
how to play dirty...

185
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,190
No way would I let such an exceptional
surveyor as Nami go so easily.

186
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,650
But I'm not a heartless devil.

187
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,170
Once she's done surveying
all of the world's seas,

188
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,040
I'll give her her freedom!

189
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,700
That's like decades from now!

190
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,030
Not even a hundred years'd be enough!

191
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,100
Alright! Let's meet up with Luffy ASAP!

192
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,800
Hey, Sanji. What're you doing?

193
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,070
Appreciating happiness.

194
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,230
What're you talking about?

195
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,150
Nami-san's lived with many times
the suffering of a normal person.

196
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,890
I'm going to take away
that suffering of hers.

197
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,530
Is there any happiness
greater than this?

198
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,440
Your ulterior motive's
way obvious, Love Cook.

199
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,670
I'm fighting for a beautiful person.
What's wrong with that?

200
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,190
That's not what this is for!
It's for Nami and the villagers!

201
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,720
Shaddup.

202
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,850
Quit your jabbering and let's go!

203
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,980
No more of this!
Take up your weapons!

204
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,040
Let's fight!

205
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,330
Gen-san! Everyone!
Please! Don't be hasty!

206
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,520
You can't die! It'll all be over!

207
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,170
You have to survive,
or everything will end!

208
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,580
Eight years ago, we swore
not to throw away our lives!

209
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,390
No matter how painful and insulting
it was to be ruled by them,

210
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,410
we swore to fight the patient fight
as long as Nami was cheerful!

211
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,560
But this is their answer!

212
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,530
Now that our village's chance for
freedom is gone, we have no hope!

213
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,490
More than that,

214
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,530
we must make those fishmen pay
for toying with that girl's kindness!

215
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,190
Any objections?!

216
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,390
Of course not! Let's go!

217
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,240
We were always fully ready
to fight at any time!

218
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,380
I refuse to let them
rule over me any more!

219
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,430
Wait, everyone!

220
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,970
Nami!

221
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,810
Just a little more!
Just wait a little more!

222
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,880
I'll work hard again!

223
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,980
I'll save up the money again!

224
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,100
It'll be easy this time!

225
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,350
I'm used to it! I'll be fine!
There's no need to worry at all!

226
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,780
This is nothing
compared to back then!

227
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,470
Please, no more dying!

228
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,130
Everyone! I'm fine! I'm just fine!

229
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,460
You can stop now... Even you
know there's no point now...

230
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,570
You fought very well, carrying our
lives on your back all this time...

231
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,290
Joining them must've been
even more painful for you

232
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,690
than being cut through the heart...

233
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,070
You fought very well.

234
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,910
Gen-san...

235
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,200
Leave the village now.

236
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,620
Gen-san?!

237
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,170
Do it, Nami.

238
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,500
W-What?!

239
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,250
Nacchan...

240
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,190
Nami...

241
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,690
You're crafty, and you have a dream.

242
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,460
Nojiko! Everyone!

243
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,300
I won't let you go!

244
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,960
Stop it, everyone!

245
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,860
I don't want to see anyone
else get hurt by them!

246
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,610
You'll die, you know!

247
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,690
We know.

248
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,180
It's no use!
We've made up our minds!

249
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,530
Get out of our way, Nami!

250
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,460
Let's go, everyone!

251
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,760
Even if we can't win, let's
show 'em what we're made of!

252
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,960
Arlong!

253
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,000
Arlong! Arlong!

254
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,370
Arlong! Arlong!

255
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,310
Arlong! Arlong! Arlong!

256
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,590
Arlong! Arlong!

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,520
Arl--

258
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,730
Luffy...

259
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,260
What do you want?!
You don't even know anything!

260
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,370
You don't even know what's happened
on this island the past 8 years!

261
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,840
Yeah. I don't know.

262
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,050
This has nothing to do with you!

263
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,500
I told you, leave the
damn island already!

264
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,310
Yeah. You told me.

265
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,110
Leave! I don't need you!

266
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,680
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

267
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,940
Leave! Leave! Leave!

268
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,540
Leave!

269
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,000
Luffy...

270
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,110
Help me...

271
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,720
Of course I will!

272
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,240
Don't touch my treasure!

273
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,350
Luffy...

274
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,120
Let's go.

275
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,820
Yeah!

276
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,020
Hey! Are you guys alright?!

277
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,730
Did Arlong do this to you?!

278
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,640
Move aside.

279
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,290
We have business with the fishmen.

280
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,770
Now that we know the
truth about Big Sis Nami,

281
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,260
we felt the only thing
we can do was defeat Arlong.

282
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,880
So we challenged him...

283
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
But we lost by a hair.

284
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,150
Sorry, but we're not letting
you through this door,

285
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,780
seeing as you have no hope for victory!

286
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,750
What?!

287
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,170
We're waiting for certain
men to arrive here, you see!

288
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,240
Certain men?

289
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,060
I'd bet my life on it. They will come!

290
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,170
Here they come!

291
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,280
It's them...

292
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,220
Just who are they?

293
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,410
If they can't handle them,

294
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,550
then there's no hope
for not only this island,

295
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,240
but for the future of
the entire East Blue!

296
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,170
The faces of those four men
who're here to change destiny...

297
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,410
Burn their images into your eyes!

298
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,750
Move aside.

299
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,770
Hey, do you think those two
idiots were part of Zoro's group?

300
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,910
Zoro's? They seemed too weak for that.

301
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,470
They're not even worth killing.

302
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,000
That's for sure!

303
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,860
What the...?

304
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,870
Which one of you is Arlong?!

305
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

306
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

307
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

308
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

309
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

310
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

311
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

312
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

313
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

314
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

315
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

316
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,140
You just had to run ahead by yourself!

317
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,540
I said don't hog all the prey!

318
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,510
Really?

319
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:30,930
Huh?

320
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,650
What's wrong?!

321
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,950
Yeah, that's the thing!
I'm kind of in trouble! Hear me out!

322
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,620
Oh, crap! That guy
plans to do something!

323
