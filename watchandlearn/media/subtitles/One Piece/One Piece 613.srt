00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,130
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,310
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,620
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

9
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

10
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

11
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,100
After surviving a fierce battle,

12
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,420
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

13
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,780
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

14
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,980
They landed on Punk Hazard;

15
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,360
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen.

16
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,040
After learning about the ruler of
the island - Caesar Clown's motive,

17
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,460
and all while trying to escape Shinokuni,

18
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,670
along with their pirate ally
- the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

19
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,640
they are on the move to kidnap
Caesar, save the children,

20
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
and escape from the island.

21
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,430
What a shame.

22
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,970
Why are you trying to attack the weak ones?

23
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,950
How did the gas flow in?!

24
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,500
I thought the door was closed!

25
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,280
Is it leaking from somewhere?

26
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,330
Really?!

27
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,410
If so, this building is no longer safe!

28
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,750
We have no time!

29
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,420
Let's split up to look for the
Sea Prism Stone Handcuffs!

30
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,920
You've been only defending yourself

31
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,680
without even trying to attack. Why is it?

32
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,510
Could it be what I think it is?

33
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,770
To be honest, I didn't think
I could beat you but...

34
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,360
...maybe I can.

35
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,860
I'm gonna stay here!

36
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,740
What?!

37
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,120
What are you thinking?

38
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,880
I think you need my help here!

39
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,590
What?

40
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,840
"Showing Off His Techniques! Zoro's
Formidable One-Sword Style!"

41
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,520
Alright! Let's go, G-5!

42
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,770
Let's go save the children
like Captain-chan said!

43
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,150
Yeah!

44
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,200
I can't believe there is another
Logia eater besides Caesar!

45
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,350
That cute harpy-chan was
a Devil Fruit eater?!

46
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,840
How awful!

47
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,080
We can't handle her!

48
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,200
Black Foot brother!

49
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,160
Why didn't you help us when
she was attacking us?!

50
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,300
Don't be such a baby! I don't kick women!

51
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,460
Then what would you do in
a life-or-death battle?!

52
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,840
I'd choose death!

53
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,480
That's ridiculous!

54
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,730
They're all so different even though
they're in the same pirate group!

55
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,140
That Pirate Hunter guy looked like

56
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,140
he'd chop up anybody without mercy.

57
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,680
Yeah, yeah.

58
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,440
Surprisingly, he has a soft side
too but he will find a way out!

59
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,190
You can count on him.

60
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,360
Don't worry about Tashigi-chan, either!

61
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,430
What we have got to do

62
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,290
is save those damn children to impress
Nami-san, Robin-chan, and Tashigi-chan!

63
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,160
Yeah!

64
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,990
All for the ladies!

65
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,970
NEAR THE EXIT OF THE BISCUIT ROOM

66
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,420
Why don't you go with them?

67
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,020
I'm free to do whatever I want!

68
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,900
I don't need you here!

69
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,590
You're free to think whatever you like!

70
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,430
Well then,

71
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,380
am I free to take care

72
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,600
of you first since I'm a
pirate, Navy soldier girl?!

73
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,610
You can't do that.

74
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,030
What?!

75
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,310
You're not gonna cut me...

76
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,410
…or that woman!

77
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,950
You don't know that!

78
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,110
That's what I was just thinking.

79
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,910
I was right.

80
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,930
Well then... I'm in a hurry, so...

81
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,520
Why aren't you finishing me off?!

82
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,000
Is it because I'm a woman?!

83
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,260
It's humiliating that you won't
fight seriously in a game played

84
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,550
in earnest just because men're
physically stronger than women!

85
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,560
I'm sure you don't understand the feeling

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,470
that I wish I was born a boy!

87
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,080
I don't carry a sword for pleasure!

88
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,920
I don't like your very being!

89
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,900
Listen! Your face!

90
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,060
It looks exactly like my close
friend's who died long ago!

91
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,180
On top of that, you started saying
the same thing she used to say!

92
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,770
Don't imitate, you copycat woman!

93
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,730
What?! Stop talking like a child!

94
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,010
You view women as inferior!

95
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,690
You don't really try to fight us!

96
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,390
You won't kill us!

97
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,420
Maybe you're not gonna lose but
you're not gonna win either!

98
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,520
That's why I had to stay here!

99
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,800
If I let this Logia eater go after
my people, there will be carnage!

100
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you looking down on me?!

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Yes, I am.

102
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,010
Oh!

103
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,070
Do as you like.

104
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,760
My duty is to keep her from
going after my friends, too.

105
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,120
I just wanna keep her away from that path.

106
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,090
How can you take it so easy?

107
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,290
Don't you know that we're out of time?!

108
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,670
You better run, too!

109
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,840
Don't drop your guard.
She's willing to kill you.

110
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,300
He's right! Thank you for
sharing his weak point!

111
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
Even though you can use Haki,

112
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,640
it's not so hard for me to gnaw you to death!

113
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,490
How annoying!

114
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,450
But even if Haki allows you to sense
a Devil Fruit eater's true form,

115
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,240
you can't catch me unless
you can keep up with me!

116
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,410
Isn't that right?!

117
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,700
I thought so.

118
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,430
You're a cold man.

119
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,890
This? Coming from a snow woman?

120
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,360
Pay attention!

121
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,110
Do you like snowball fights?

122
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,060
Snow Rabbit!

123
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,190
Shave!

124
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,510
You're Smoker's right-hand girl.

125
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,290
Maybe I have underestimated you a little bit.

126
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,540
I wonder how he is now.

127
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,760
I know he's pretty strong
but Vergo is more...

128
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,930
You don't have to worry about Smoker-san!

129
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,890
You people can't beat him!
Not in a million years!

130
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,520
I know that better than anybody!

131
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,810
How scary.

132
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,860
Snowstorm.

133
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,820
Whoa-whoa!

134
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,580
Why is it chasing me?!

135
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,580
B BUILDING - USOPP

136
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,020
Don't follow me!

137
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,350
Alright. It's not gonna be safe here

138
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,890
and I gotta find the Sea Prism
Stone handcuffs already!

139
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,430
That was close...

140
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,720
What is this place?

141
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,430
It's dark and I can't see anything!

142
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,200
And it's cold!

143
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,250
The handcuffs... Where are the handcuffs?

144
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,210
I hope there are no monsters in here!

145
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,150
Oh! Oops!

146
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,640
Excuse me, Kin'emon-san!

147
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,600
Where are you hurrying off to?

148
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,720
Corpse-dono! I heard children's
voices - they were close!

149
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,400
What?! But that doesn't
mean you can leave me here!

150
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,860
The poison gas is coming this way, too!

151
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,780
Momonosuke!

152
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,320
--Oh, children!
--Who are you?!

153
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,870
Do you kids know Momonosuke?

154
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,830
He is my son!

155
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,870
--I'm scared!
--What?

156
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,610
Wait! Just wait!

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
What?

158
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,170
There are so many of them!

159
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,470
Momonosuke! Is Momonosuke here?!

160
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,010
Answer me if you're here!

161
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,190
There were still this many kids?!

162
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,980
Alright!

163
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,460
It's dangerous here! Everybody,
get to R Building!

164
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,610
A skeleton!

165
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,160
How could you say that?
But I'm glad they're fine!

166
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,780
Go to R Building now!

167
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,160
Hey, are you looking for Momonosuke-kun?

168
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,200
Mocha!

169
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,030
Give us the candy!

170
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,790
B BUILDING 3RD FLOOR - A PATH IN THE BACK

171
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,790
Stop! You can't have it all!

172
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,890
Konbu! Doran! Everybody!

173
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,130
I know it's hard but you can't have it!

174
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,850
There she is! Mocha!

175
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,390
Robin! Hold the children!

176
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,520
Cien Fleurs!

177
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,480
What?! The hands again?!

178
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,700
I'm sorry! I had to do this.

179
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,240
This will ease your pain a bit.

180
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,330
Sis!

181
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,750
Mocha!

182
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,170
Mocha! Don't let them have those candies!

183
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,470
Keep running!

184
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,370
Uh-huh!

185
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,990
Chopper-chan, I'm not gonna give up!

186
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,640
I won't give up - for everyone's sake!

187
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm not gonna let anybody have it!

188
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,710
THE BASEMENT OF C BUILDING - A GARBAGE DUMP

189
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,270
Hey, are you alright?!

190
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,710
I'll take it from here, Momo!

191
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,570
Wait for me, Caesar!

192
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll say hi to your people for you

193
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,130
and tell them "She died a tragic death."

194
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,860
Sword Snow - Skin Sword!

195
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,290
Wh-What happened to my shoulder?!

196
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,290
What are you doing?! Let go of me!

197
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,240
If I let go of her, she's
gonna bite off my shoulder!

198
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,040
I can just shred it to pieces if you prefer!

199
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,280
You talked so big but took so much time.

200
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,510
Time's up.

201
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,160
I have to go now.

202
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,930
I thought he wouldn't cut women.

203
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,470
But he just tried to cut me!

204
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,810
You've underestimated me, snow woman.

205
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,070
When you thought you couldn't beat me,

206
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,850
you should have run.

207
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,530
Of course, there are things
that I don't wanna cut.

208
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,160
But...

209
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,830
...let me ask you something.

210
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,840
Have you ever seen a fierce animal
you were sure would never bite?

211
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,100
Because I haven't.

212
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,520
Wh-What?!

213
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,140
I can't move!

214
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,350
One-Sword!

215
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,650
He's gonna cut me!

216
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,090
Great Dragon Shock!

217
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,950
Are you two happy now?

218
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,710
He cut her!

219
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,760
How insulting!

220
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,130
What?

221
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,220
Is she still alive?!

222
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,600
He didn't use Haki?

223
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,840
Is this how he shows his mercy?

224
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,310
I guess she can't control her body.

225
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,130
Because she's frightened by
his overwhelming strength

226
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,220
and the fact she could have
died if he had used Haki!

227
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,670
I've never seen anyone
beat somebody like this!

228
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,350
When the Straw Hats disappeared
for two years,--

229
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,960
I wonder where they were
and what they were doing.

230
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,030
Just how strong have they become?!

231
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,070
Ro... ro... noa... Zoro!

232
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,120
I won't let you get away!

233
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,240
Sword Autumn Rain!

234
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,550
You lose.

235
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,660
What was that?!

236
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,820
You didn't try to kill
her after all, did you?!

237
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,240
See, like I said, you're...

238
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,790
I didn't ask you to do that. So shut up.

239
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,500
If you didn't kill her, I did.

240
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,210
Don't lie! It's not fair! I already cut her!

241
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,800
You didn't have to do that.

242
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,340
But...

243
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,260
Good job, Captain Eyeglasses.

244
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,250
You stopped her from going after anybody.

245
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,560
You can take the credit.

246
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,210
Why do you always talk like
you're greater than me?!

247
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,940
Because I am.

248
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,250
What's wrong?

249
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,690
It's nothing. You can go ahead.

250
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,060
Hey, hey!

251
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,040
Monet... Huh! How useless!

252
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,220
Straw Hats! Make your way
to R Building already!

253
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,930
That's where you'll meet your demise!

254
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,330
I can't wait to see you suffer

255
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,610
from the gas and groan, as my test subjects!

256
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,630
While holding the candy,
Mocha desperately tries to get away.

257
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,730
But then the crazed children surround her.

258
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,970
Just when the children almost
successfully take the candy,

259
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,470
Mocha makes a surprising move,

260
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,100
making Chopper's heartbreaking scream resonate.

261
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

262
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,890
"To Save Her Friends! Mocha
Runs at the Risk of Her Life!"

263
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
