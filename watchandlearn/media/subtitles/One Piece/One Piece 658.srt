The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980
Running at full speed

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,350
Force it and go

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,590

Keep on advancing

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,260
The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,290
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,060
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

Yes, Shining! Running! Forever

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

60
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power

61
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,510
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

69
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

70
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,900
and his friends venture into that sea.

71
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

72
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,810
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

73
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,060
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

74
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,000
with Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,440
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,700
get the Flare-Flare Fruit as the
prize - and won the first round.

77
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,890
And Rebecca, the gladiator
girl Luffy supports,

78
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,080
is fighting hard in the last match of the first round.

79
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,150
"A Big Surprise!
A True Identity of the Toy Soldier!"

80
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,600
L-L-L-L....

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,670
Luffy-senpai!

82
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,820
L-L-Luffy-senpai!

83
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,470
Hey! You must be Bartolomeo-kun.

84
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,980
You were pretty impressive in the Block B match!

85
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,700
Yes, I am, Luffy-senpai!

86
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,590
Y-Y-You know my name?!

87
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,530
Of course, I do!

88
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,320
Let's wish each other good luck in the finals!

89
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,080
I have no chance!

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,970
I'm just a guy who set out to the sea
wanting to be like you!

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,900
Let's see...

92
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
Which way was it to the
place to watch the fight?

93
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,970
Oh, that way!

94
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,780
Luffy-senpai!

95
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,700
Whoa-whoa, people keep
falling one after another.

96
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,360
Oh, grandpa!

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,280
Brother!

98
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,810
It stinks!

99
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,750
Hi, Boo.

100
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,820
Where are we?
A stack of toys and trash?

101
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,720
What is this place, brother?

102
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,260
How do we know?

103
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,870
The next one will fall there.
Get out of his way!

104
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,110
I can't believe there is such a huge
junkyard underneath the kingdom.

105
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,490
Sorry if I'm wrong.

106
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,020
But I have the slight suspicion that...

107
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,140
...you're...

108
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,090
I mean, you, sir, are...

109
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,670
...King Riku-sama, aren't you?

110
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,540
--King Riku?!
--No way!

111
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,730
He's King Riku?! That's absurd!

112
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,450
I thought he was dead.

113
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,640
I heard the former king of Dressrosa...

114
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,150
...resorted to unbelievable
violence and got killed!

115
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,490
Since I'm deep underground now,

116
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,210
I no longer need to disguise myself.

117
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,050
You're right.

118
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,130
But don't call me "King" anymore,
Captain Tank!

119
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,760
THE FORMER KING OF DRESSROSA

120
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,490
He's King Riku!

121
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,290
RIKU DOLDO III
(REBECCA'S GRANDFATHER)

122
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,890
I can't believe he's alive!

123
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,750
King Riku-sama!
I'm so happy to see you again!

124
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,740
I'm just another old man now.

125
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,620
Just a sinful old man who can't
even save his own granddaughter.

126
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,590
It's been a while!

127
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,110
I am now...

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,600
...Doflamingo's...

129
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,580
Don't say it!

130
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,500
I know.

131
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,140
You're watching over Viola.

132
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,600
How could I disbelieve
a dutiful man like you?

133
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,050
It must've been hard for you.

134
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,750
It's nothing compared with
what you've gone through.

135
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,920
I can't believe it! You are King Riku!

136
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,700
Oh! You're the king of Prodence!

137
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,350
Long time no see!

138
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,850
You saved my kingdom when we
were in trouble many times!

139
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,470
I'm glad that you're alive!

140
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,870
Whoa-whoa!

141
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,790
Since you've been gone,

142
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,400
the countries around here lost balance
and there's been war after war!

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,850
I'm sick and tired of it.

144
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,150
Wait a minute, Elizabello!

145
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,130
Maybe you're tired of it but
each time somebody cries,

146
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,060
somebody else laughs!

147
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,530
Someone is agitating the countries to fight
and making millions!

148
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,430
By selling tons of weapons
to those countries at war!

149
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,330
Boy... That broker is named Joker.

150
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,650
And that's Doflamingo's alias.

151
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,720
But we don't know where they manufacture
those weapons or keep them.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,110
Our country, the Kano Kingdom,
is at war now

153
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,630
and we're in trouble because the
enemy keeps getting weapons.

154
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,370
We entered the competition in the Colosseum
just to search for the weapons!

155
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,380
We Happo Navy's true purpose is
to break down the smuggling ring of weapons...

156
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,340
...by the request of the king
of the Kano Kingdom!

157
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,110
King Riku! Because you did such a foolish thing
and Doflamingo became king,

158
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,170
the neighboring countries are in trouble!

159
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,850
He's right, Elizabello-sama!

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,560
Yes, we were deeply indebted to
Dressrosa in the past

161
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,900
but there's no need to keep affection for
that man anymore!

162
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,460
The name "King Riku" is now...

163
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,280
Shut up, Dagama!

164
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,520
You don't know what really
happened 10 years ago -

165
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,370
the tragedy of that day!

166
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,110
So don't talk shit
about the king's personality!

167
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,260
Tank! It's okay!
It's too late to say anything!

168
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,510
King Riku-sama, I, too, was...

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,850
...a soldier of the army!

170
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,910
Me, too!

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,960
Me, too, King Riku-sama!

172
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,750
What the...

173
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,710
The toys are starting to move!

174
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,540
I thought they were all broken!

175
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,110
Dressrosa's former soldiers

176
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,210
and even the toys are bowing to him!

177
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,810
What's going on?

178
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,070
I thought all the people hated King Riku!

179
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,190
Yeah. Since they have this wide area here,

180
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,520
I think there is...

181
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,960
...something more underground.

182
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,630
I see.

183
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,380
Keep looking.

184
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,440
Clank.

185
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,440
Brother!

186
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,250
What?! What?!
What is it this time?!

187
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,550
Enough with this annoying crap!
Whoever it is,

188
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,250
if you hurt Sai, I'll carry my anger
even towards your grandchildren!

189
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,620
What's this sticky thing?!

190
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,530
Sai!

191
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,350
Brother!

192
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,810
What is this?! What's going on?!

193
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,720
Stay away! Hey, stop!
Who are you?! Hey!

194
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,090
Stop it!

195
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
Hey, hey!

196
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,270
It's done so you can go now.

197
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,990
Do not harm any human
and follow any orders from the Family.

198
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,210
Those are the rules.

199
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,100
If you go straight out that door,
there is a factory and a trade port.

200
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,600
Go.

201
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,350
No talking! Just work hard!

202
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,730
Since the contenders were all so powerful,
they're not gonna break easily!

203
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,900
What's going on?!
I can't move my own body as I want!

204
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,440
I can only can move as he directed me!

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,030
What the hell is happening to me?!

206
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,400
THE FLOWER FIELD
THE KING RIKU ARMY HEADQUARTERS

207
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,770
A long time ago, the ancestors of the Tontatta Tribe
kept going out to the sea...

208
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,730
...looking for natural resources
that their land lacked.

209
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,650
But Big Humans kept discovering them,

210
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,990
and they were facing extinction.

211
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,630
I found them! The Little People!

212
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,410
Catch them!

213
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,300
But one day, the king of Dressrosa,
one of the neighboring countries,

214
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,010
offered them a deal...

215
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,790
...that he would provide
resources and guarantee

216
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,800
their safety in exchange
for a little bit of work.

217
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,880
That king's name was Don Quixote!

218
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,530
That led to the worst times of
the Tontatta Tribe's history...

219
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,020
...which continued on until 900 years ago.

220
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,200
The slave era!

221
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,880
There are some surviving manuscripts that

222
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,480
describe how cruel the royal family was.

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,110
They were literally like devils!

224
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,360
Our ancestors were forced to work and work

225
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,580
deep underground unnoticed by anyone

226
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,800
while the Big Humans were
living lavishly on the wealth

227
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,270
provided by the work of the Tontatta Tribe.

228
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,060
Records from the subsequent Hundred Year Void
are lost

229
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,520
but 800 years ago,
a new king took the throne of Dressrosa.

230
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,020
It was King Riku!

231
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,210
When King Riku heard...

232
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,980
...that the Little People were being treated
as less than humans for centuries,

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,320
he cried and apologized profusely.

234
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,390
Then, the new king devised
a form of compensation for them!

235
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,570
He told them they

236
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,260
could simply take anything
that they needed from the country.

237
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,070
They didn't have to work.

238
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,610
--Oh, my bag is gone!
--So is my watch!

239
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,310
I can't find my wallet!

240
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,420
Oh no! My jacket got stolen, too!

241
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,280
My Shusui that was here a minute ago!

242
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,250
They stole from everybody.

243
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,470
It was fairies who took your stuff.

244
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,590
What are you talking about?!

245
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,530
Fairies are fairies.
All you can do is laugh it off and let it go.

246
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,900
How can I laugh it off?!

247
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,810
Those invisible fairies are
the guardian deities of

248
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,070
Dressrosa from ancient times.

249
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,200
We have to turn a blind
eye to whatever they do.

250
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,380
--Well, if fairies did it...
--We should just forget about it!

251
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,710
The king called it the work of fairies and

252
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,380
calmed his citizens down by laughing it off

253
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,190
and he established successfully the
legend of fairies in this country.

254
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,930
How cool! The first King Riku!

255
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,980
The country was governed by
the gentle Riku Family...

256
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,170
...unstintingly supporting its neighboring countries
when they were in trouble.

257
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,590
I can't say the country was wealthy

258
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,540
but it became renowned
and the people were always smiling.

259
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,400
Our ancestors paid tribute
to King Riku's kindness

260
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,030
and they voluntarily filled the country with
lots of greens and beautiful flowers.

261
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,880
That's how we Tontatta Kingdom and...

262
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,760
...the successive Riku Family
deepened our bonds over 800 years.

263
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,870
But now, after 900 years,

264
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,320
Doflamingo, the descendent of
the Don Quixote Family, has returned

265
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,810
and he is trying
to repeat that horrible history!

266
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,460
My daughter - Mancherie

267
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,070
and 500 of our people already
fell victim to that man.

268
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,600
We can't let him repeat history!

269
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,970
No, we can't!

270
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,510
So we fight!

271
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,260
That's right!

272
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,320
The return of the Don Quixote line is
doing Dressrosa and Tontatta...

273
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,680
...no good -- and much harm!

274
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,020
We fight with the heroes!

275
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,260
Usoland will help us tremendously!

276
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:49,180
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

277
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,700
Th-That's exactly what I was thinking!

278
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,140
That's our hero!

279
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,520
King Riku is a good guy!

280
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,150
He has been so nice
even to these worm-like people!

281
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,890
What did you just call us?!

282
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,760
I meant it in a good way.

283
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,490
It's okay, then!

284
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,360
Rot in hell, granddaughter of King Riku!

285
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,230
Drop dead, Rebecca!

286
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,880
Commander-san.

287
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,500
That gladiator girl who is fighting
in the Colosseum is...

288
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,150
...being called King Riku's granddaughter
and getting insulted.

289
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,410
It seems like the people
of this country hate King Riku.

290
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,680
That's what I thought!

291
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,170
Usoland! Usoland!

292
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,020
10 years ago,

293
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,150
there was an incident in which
King Riku lost the trust

294
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,630
of all his citizens overnight.

295
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,430
The king was trying to protect
his country until the end but...

296
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,850
The corrupted King Riku's family!

297
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,990
Screw you, Rebecca!

298
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,310
Cut her to pieces!

299
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,950
The people don't know
what really happened that day.

300
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,870
I'm sorry!

301
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,660
I couldn't protect your mother!

302
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:22,030
Doflamingo tried to kill every
member of the King Riku Family

303
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,340
but I took Rebecca who has
King Riku's blood in her veins

304
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,610
and ran away for a very long time.

305
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,370
But she got caught in the end

306
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,710
and they keep her
on public display at the Colosseum.

307
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,280
If I can regain the people's trust in King Riku
and save Rebecca's life,

308
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,620
I wouldn't mind sacrificing my life
anytime, anywhere!

309
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,920
I put everything on the line for this war!

310
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,960
Who are you?

311
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,420
I couldn't protect Rebecca's mother.

312
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,540
Mother-sama...

313
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,840
Mother-sama!

314
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,290
Mother-sama!!

315
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,970
I'm sorry!

316
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm sorry!!

317
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,820
