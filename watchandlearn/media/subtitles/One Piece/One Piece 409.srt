2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,290
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,480
Luffy was ejected from
the Sabaody Archipelago

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,340
by Bartholomew Kuma, a Warlord of the Sea.

52
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,530
I have my Vivre Card!

53
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,420
Good thing we all got one!

54
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,250
I'm sure I'll see everyone again!

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,900
After being separated from his friends
and sent to an unknown isle alone,

56
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,170
Luffy intended to rely on his
Vivre Card to reunite with the others, but...

57
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,760
Aren't these Laughing Mushrooms?

58
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,470
Hurry! The smoke is rising from over there!

59
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,150
What do you suppose this is?

60
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,690
Luffy, after accidentally
eating a Parasite Mushroom,

61
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,570
was carried to a village by mysterious women.

62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,510
Huh? Look here!

63
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,280
What's wrong?

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,420
There's still one mushroom left!

65
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,000
But doesn't this one seem
different from the others?

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,710
It's oddly shaped!

67
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,800
Anyway, I guess we better pull it off!

68
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,810
What's this? What's this?

69
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,450
What's going on?

70
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,270
Oh, Granny Nyon!

71
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,100
There's a mushroom growing
on this girl that won't come off!

72
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,230
Oh, my!

73
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,860
Th-This person...

74
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,940
...is a m-m-man!

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,280
Th-This is a m-man?!

76
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,870
I've never seen one before!

77
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,110
"Hurry Back to Your Friends!
The Maiden Island Adventure"

78
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:33,180
"Maiden Island – Amazon Lily"

79
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,200
This is the all-female land of Amazon Lily.

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,180
On occasion, women will leave
the island and return with child,

81
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,790
but oddly enough,
they only give birth to girls.

82
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,650
"Kuja"

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,920
Inside a tall mountain surrounded
by thick jungle is a large hole,

84
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,740
and inside it a fortress-like village
was built and a country created.

85
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,360
Come on in!

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,870
Oh, that ribbon!

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,770
We both have one!

88
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,530
I found it!

89
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,600
Step right up! We have
Sea King meat on hand today!

90
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,450
It looks good!

91
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,170
It'll make your skin nice and smooth, too!

92
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,300
How about some fresh-picked
fruit from the jungle?!

93
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,510
All the wage-earning and manual labor
is done by women too, of course.

94
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,740
I brought it!

95
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,700
Thanks! Just set it right there!

96
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,110
Sure thing!

97
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,820
Raised from birth as warriors,

98
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,400
they truly are burly and large-hearted,

99
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,890
but they also have an air of
elegance about them as well.

100
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,560
There is no place here
for greedy, foolish men at all.

101
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,080
"Fighting"

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,080
And, more than anything, the
women of this island are strong.

103
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,380
Here are today's odds!

104
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,950
1,000 Gol on Poppy!

105
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,000
1,500 on Pansy!

106
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,840
In this land, the strong are beautiful.

107
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,760
Should a man ever approach this country,

108
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,930
eradication is all that awaits him.

109
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,220
"Prison"

110
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,310
The man's awake!

111
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,620
Let me see! Let me see!

112
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,610
I want to see, too!

113
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,950
He's moving around!

114
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,600
Look! He has no breasts at all!

115
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,760
What a weird, rugged creature!

116
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,410
He looks so weak with his
shaggy hair and scrawny body!

117
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,510
He slept for quite a long time...

118
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,780
But I heard he ate meals while asleep!

119
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,230
Did you know that?

120
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,090
What do men usually eat anyway? Raw meat?

121
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,490
I get the feeling he'll eat anything...

122
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,270
What's going on?

123
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,840
--What's all the noise?
--Oh! He can talk!

124
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,300
Where am I?

125
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,040
What was I doing again?

126
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,120
Oh, yeah!

127
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,820
Everyone was separated
at Sabaody Archipelago!

128
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
I can't hear!

129
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,810
Everyone! Shh! He's saying something!

130
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,040
I remember eating mushrooms,
but everything after--

131
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,780
My hat's gone!

132
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,750
There it is!

133
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,710
Give it back, you jerk!

134
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,000
His arm stretched!

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,840
What kind of body does he have?!

136
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,460
That's a relief!

137
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,510
M-M-Men can stretch their arms!

138
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,580
How shocking! Notes! Notes!

139
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,730
This is most intriguing!

140
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,300
Say! What's your name?

141
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,850
I'm Luffy.

142
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,990
I'm naked!

143
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,300
You're slow!

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,910
I feel breezy!

145
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,760
Do you know where my clothes are?

146
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,330
Men are slow and want to conceal
their heads before their bodies!

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,110
Umm, before you get dressed, umm...!

148
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,210
What's inside that bag
sewn between your legs?

149
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,430
Bag?

150
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,180
Wait, you don't know what these are?

151
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,590
What a weirdo! These are balls!

152
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,620
Balls?

153
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,820
Balls?

154
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,940
Balls?

155
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,150
Balls?

156
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,860
--Balls?
--Balls?

157
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,020
I can't see them! Scoot over, Margaret!

158
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,240
Sorry!

159
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Your notebook's in the way!

160
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,280
What are balls?

161
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,390
They're the family jewels, of course!

162
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,780
Wow!

163
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,090
So men have family jewels!

164
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,350
Gorgeous!

165
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,460
Family jewels!

166
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,810
Could you take your jewels out
and let us see them?

167
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,840
Hell no!

168
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,760
Are you trying to kill me?! You idiot!

169
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,770
Here are your clothes then!

170
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,930
Yours were all torn up,

171
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,950
so I made new ones with the same design!

172
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,280
Oh?! That's great!

173
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,630
Thanks! I don't even know who you are!

174
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,610
I'm sure you'll like them!

175
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,720
What did you...?

176
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,000
I added sexy flower frills too!

177
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,070
Outdoor outfits are all about the frills!

178
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,550
Great job, Margaret!

179
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,020
He seems so happy he's shaking!

180
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,830
He's thanking you on his hands and knees!

181
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,980
Don't be stupid!

182
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,330
I'm a man, you know!

183
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,170
Prepare to attack!

184
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,410
What?!

185
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,440
What a vicious temper!
Is that your true nature?!

186
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,460
Wantonly yelling without any care
for the fact that we saved his life...

187
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,390
What a savage temperament!

188
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,580
His words and actions haven't shown
a shred of elegance whatsoever!

189
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,080
His kind really is incompatible
with us after all!

190
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,830
Even so, Kikyo!

191
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,620
He hasn't done much!
I'd feel sorry for killing him!

192
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,010
Wait! Hold on!

193
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,780
You saved my life?!

194
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,650
What happened?! Tell me!

195
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,390
These girls saved you after you ate
a lethal mushroom and collapsed.

196
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,930
Oh, really?! Thanks, you!

197
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
Sorry for complaining about the clothes!

198
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,980
Just don't shoot me!

199
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,400
Your apologies and excuses mean nothing!

200
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,240
This is the woman empire of Amazon Lily!

201
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,520
Men are forbidden!

202
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,020
That has been the absolute
rule here for centuries!

203
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,450
Never in history has it been broken!

204
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,670
Woman empire?!

205
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,620
Woman empire?!

206
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,580
Now that you've regained consciousness,

207
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,680
we have no sympathy for you!

208
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,410
Yeah! Now that I look closer,
it's nothing but women!

209
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,240
What a weird country!

210
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,220
We'll put an end to that
disdainful way of talking as well!

211
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,360
Hey!

212
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,620
Do we really have to put an end to him?

213
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,600
Aphelandra!

214
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,170
When the Snake Princess returns,

215
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,920
she will absolutely disapprove
of this situation!

216
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,290
You'll also be charged with the crime
of bringing a man into the village!

217
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,350
Margaret.

218
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,700
Sweetpea.

219
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,110
Aphelandra.

220
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,660
This is for your sake!

221
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,540
It is best that we cover up this incident!

222
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,670
Wait! Let me go!

223
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,690
I have to get to the place
my friends and I agreed on!

224
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,170
Shoot!

225
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,440
He broke through the roof!

226
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,990
Don't let him escape!

227
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,680
These arrows are really strong!

228
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,130
Yikes!

229
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,160
He's nimbler than he looks!

230
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,320
Aphelandra!

231
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,200
Right!

232
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,950
Sorry for saving you and then doing this!

233
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,490
He fell!

234
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,540
Now he's bouncing!

235
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,520
Hmm, now what do I do?

236
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,140
Take him down!

237
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,420
Don't let him escape! After him!

238
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,140
There he is!

239
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,100
Only one meat chop left
until they're sold out!

240
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,190
First come, first served!

241
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,300
Hold on! You gotta pay for that!

242
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,620
Treasure payment plan!

243
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,370
Enemy on the loose!

244
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,820
The man has escaped!

245
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,220
My food disappeared!

246
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,100
What is that?!

247
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,030
He went that way!

248
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,050
My meal is gone too!

249
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,090
Kill him!

250
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,510
Just give yourself up!

251
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,770
I-Is it just me, or are
there a lot more of ‘em?!

252
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,110
Get back here!

253
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,730
I'll get him! Aphelandra!

254
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,690
Right!

255
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,250
You're not getting away from me!

256
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,590
He dodged it!

257
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,750
I can't stop!

258
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,080
Sweetpea!

259
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,410
That's far enough!

260
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,890
We've cornered you!

261
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,770
You guys just don't give up...

262
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,680
Oh, right! My Vivre Card!

263
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,440
I left the old guy's piece
of paper in my other pants!

264
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,360
There she is! That's her!

265
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,120
I can't talk here!

266
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,050
Sorry! There's something I wanna ask you!

267
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,550
Let go! Help!

268
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,850
Oh no! Margaret's been abducted!

269
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,700
Gum-Gum Balloon!

270
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,370
Hey. You alright?

271
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,730
Stay away!

272
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,460
You... turned fat just now, didn't you?!

273
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,630
You must be crazy to jump from way up there!

274
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,330
I was ready to die!

275
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,390
It's a miracle we're still alive!

276
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,520
Really?

277
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,790
Stay away!

278
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,770
I'm not gonna do anything.

279
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,840
I've heard that you men have a virus!

280
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,640
Do all men suddenly grow fat?!

281
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,080
I don't have any kind of virus,

282
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,560
and it'll be a pain to explain,

283
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,030
so let's just say all men suddenly grow fat.

284
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,510
Anyway, was there something
in my torn-up pants pockets?

285
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,270
It's really important!

286
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,800
Is this it?

287
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,760
This is it! This is it! What a relief!

288
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,810
I wouldn't know what to do without this!

289
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,400
Thanks for holding onto it!

290
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,610
L-Let go!

291
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,150
Oh, what a relief!

292
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,690
There was something written
on it, so I figured...

293
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,080
What is it?

294
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,900
Here, look!

295
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,550
How odd! It looks like it's moving!

296
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,850
A bunch of stuff happened

297
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,780
and all my friends went flying
through the sky in different directions.

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,390
But thanks to these pieces of paper,

299
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,450
we can all get together again!

300
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,410
They're all tough, you see!

301
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,720
Oh, I've been thanking you non-stop!

302
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,500
Is there anything I can do for you?

303
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,630
Could you take out your family
jewels so I can see them, then?!

304
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,800
I told you, they don't come off!

305
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,210
Men are cheapskates after all!

306
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,780
You're really serious about taking them!

307
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,380
Put the sword away!

308
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,060
Who are these "friends" of yours?!

309
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,670
Oh, I'm a pirate!

310
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,440
Do you know what a pirate is?

311
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,650
You're a pirate?

312
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,920
This land's empress is a pirate, too.

313
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,590
Really?

314
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,640
Then she has a women-only pirate group?

315
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,120
Are they strong?

316
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,630
That's a foolish question!

317
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,960
The most elite warriors of this land
ride aboard her pirate ship!

318
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,630
They're very strong!

319
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,650
Everyone here looks up to the Snake Princess!

320
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,460
She's strong, noble, and the most
beautiful woman in the world!

321
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,750
The Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock!

322
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,470
This land is closely protected
by her and her two sisters!

323
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,480
Oh no! The Snake Princess's ship is nearby!

324
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,090
This is bad!

325
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,660
We need to end the
incident with the man quickly!

326
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,380
Kikyo...

327
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,300
It looks like the man jumped
into the jungle after all!

328
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,690
Warriors! To the jungle!

329
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,100
Kill the man and rescue Margaret!

330
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,640
The Snake Princess has returned!

331
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,360
Vice-Admiral Momonga of Navy Headquarters

332
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,880
waits for the Kuja Pirates
