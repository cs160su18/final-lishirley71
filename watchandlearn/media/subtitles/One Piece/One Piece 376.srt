2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,510
Hey, Zoro!

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,960
Robin!

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,730
Sanji!

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,820
Their bodies are vanishing!

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,860
Why?! Didn't we win?

52
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,590
Dang it! Were we too late?

53
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,670
Phew! I'm very much alive.

54
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,250
For a second, I thought I
was about to go to Heaven.

55
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,590
Sounds good to me! If we can go together,
I'd love to go to Heaven!

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,210
This isn't funny, you jerks!
We seriously thought you were dead.

57
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,850
You nearly vanished!

58
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,300
Oh, yeah! I forgot about something important!

59
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,100
What is it?

60
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,150
I had totally forgotten about him...

61
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,760
What's the matter?

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,190
We've got a problem!

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,010
There he is...

64
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,660
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?

65
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,790
The World Government is
assigning you a special mission:

66
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,500
Annihilate everyone on the island,
including the Straw Hat Crew.

67
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,510
That will be easy.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,550
His hands... are dangerous!

69
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,460
Guys, get him!

70
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,710
Yeah, you heard them!

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,890
Let's get him!

72
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,640
Stop, men! You don't stand a chance!

73
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,340
Pirate Hunter Zoro...

74
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,620
I will start with you.

75
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,720
"It Repels Everything!
Kuma's Paw-Paw Power!"

76
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,110
Hey! Stay with me!

77
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,700
Are you gonna make it?

78
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,690
What did that scumbag do?!

79
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,110
He didn't even touch the guys
to pierce them with something!

80
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,340
Is that his ability?

81
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,870
This is beyond cruel!

82
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,130
After many long years under
Moria's reign in the dark forest,

83
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,960
we only get a moment of happiness
before another Warlord appears

84
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,020
and declares that we must die!

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,850
That's low, dagnabbit!

86
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,920
You know good and well that the
Straw Hats just finished a fierce battle!

87
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,400
You might be too much for us,
but we have the energy to take you on!

88
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,160
I don't care if you're a Warlord!

89
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,500
Compared to Oars and Moria,
you don't look so big!

90
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,080
Shut up and get back.

91
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,640
He asked for me. Didn't you hear him?

92
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,280
I'll accept the challenge.
I don't need backup.

93
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,600
Don't make me look bad!

94
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,630
You and your crewmates have
earned quite the reputation.

95
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,550
It's said that Straw Hat Luffy has
several skilled subordinates on his ship.

96
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,670
Well, well, well! But it's true, it's true!

97
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,930
This is no time for all
of you to act flattered!

98
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,280
You have stirred up trouble
in various places.

99
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,900
Your captain was not the only one
to make a name for himself over time.

100
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,740
Hey, Zoro! Wait! This is totally nuts!

101
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,090
You're battered and bruised
clear to the bone!

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,160
The world is designed so that
when it rains trouble, it pours.

103
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,060
If I start making excuses,
will someone come rescue us?

104
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,860
If I die, then that shows
the limit of my ability!

105
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,320
Two-Sword Style...

106
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,720
...Sword Draw...

107
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,560
...Rashomon!

108
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,420
What was that?!

109
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,480
Look! He hasn't even done anything
and Zoro's breathing heavy!

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,280
What is that guy's ability?!

111
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,130
What's with the mark he
keeps leaving in the debris?

112
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,160
Look at the palm of his hand!

113
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,420
A-A paw?!

114
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,220
What is that doing on a human's hand?!

115
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,820
Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

116
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Look out!

117
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,440
He repelled Zoro's attack with his bare hand!

118
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,870
Is that even possible?

119
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,790
Is that your ability?

120
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,590
I have the power to repel various things.

121
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,470
I am a paw man,
having eaten the Paw-Paw Fruit.

122
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,940
A-A p-paw man?

123
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,180
--Huh?
--Why does that sound so peaceful?!

124
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,400
Are there soothing Devil Fruits?!

125
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,020
It's hard to say whether you're
a Warlord or a Purr-lord...

126
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,740
Maybe he's not such a big deal after all.

127
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,560
Franky...!

128
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,350
Franky!

129
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,570
Cyborg Franky, is that
the extent of your strength?

130
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,550
Franky, breathe!

131
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,600
Breathe, Franky!

132
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,690
Franky... got blasted away from the front!

133
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,000
That attack is incredible.

134
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,670
He might be repelling air.

135
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,790
A normal cannon wouldn't hurt Franky.

136
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,800
It's called "Pad Cannon."
When air is repelled at the speed of light,

137
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,760
it creates a shock wave that
can shoot through people.

138
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,110
Your time is up.

139
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,820
Thrust Pad Cannon!

140
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,750
Streaming Wolf-Swords!

141
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,730
--Zoro!
--He got repelled with his attack!

142
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,570
Curse you...

143
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,530
He's in trouble! He can't keep this up!

144
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,040
It's a miracle he's fought
for as long as he has!

145
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,870
As it is, that behemoth Oars
nearly beat the life out of him!

146
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,140
Zoro, behind you! Run!

147
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,520
Zoro!

148
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,480
That's as far as you go!

149
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,220
Concasser!

150
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,900
Sanji!

151
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,290
He didn't repel that with his paws!

152
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,250
I bet Sanji cracked your skull, you bastard!

153
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,460
Jerk! Stay out of this!

154
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,920
Black Foot Sanji...

155
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,940
So that would be you.

156
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,990
Sanji's kick didn't even faze him.

157
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,740
What's going on here?!

158
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,750
Why is he so hard?!
Is his face made out of iron?

159
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,050
F-Firebird Star!

160
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,470
King of Snipers...

161
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,720
What a presumptuous title.

162
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,260
Huh?

163
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,540
This is too much for them!
They don't stand a chance.

164
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,370
They're gonna get killed!

165
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,430
Zoro! Sanji!

166
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,240
As I feared, I will not derive
pleasure from killing you

167
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,140
while you are in this weakened state.

168
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,090
The government ordered me
to annihilate everyone, but...

169
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,760
What is that supposed to be?

170
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,460
Air? Is he condensing the air with his paws?

171
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,470
The bubble is getting smaller!

172
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,790
He's applying pressure to a large body
of air by repelling it with his paws!

173
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,780
That's making it shrink!

174
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,370
When all of that air depressurizes,
it will generate power!

175
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,340
The giant sonic blast it
creates will be like a bomb.

176
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,180
Wh-What?!

177
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,170
A bomb?

178
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,400
In other words, he's making a bomb?!

179
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,360
A... bomb?!

180
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,910
I will spare your lives.

181
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:09,580
In exchange, all you need to do is
hand over Straw Hat Luffy's head.

182
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,160
As long as I get his head,
the government will not complain.

183
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,420
You want us to sell out our friend?

184
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,990
Now then, give Straw Hat to me.

185
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Forget it!!

186
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,520
What a pity.

187
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,250
Ursus Shock!

188
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,260
Stay out of this, Moss Head!
I'm taking Kuma down!

189
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,030
No, you're staying out of this!

190
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,390
You jerk... Why did you...?

191
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,390
You're the cook.

192
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,520
It's the warrior's job to
risk his life in combat.

193
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,090
On the next episode of One Piece!

194
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,890
"The Pain of My Crewmates Is My Pain!
Zoro's Desperate Fight!"

195
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
