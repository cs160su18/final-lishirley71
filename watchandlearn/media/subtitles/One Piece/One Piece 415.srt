2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,180
Luffy was ejected from
the Sabaody Archipelago

51
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,420
by Bartholomew Kuma, a Warlord of the Sea.

52
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,410
Separated from his friends,

53
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,720
he arrived alone at the female-only
empire of Amazon Lily!

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,200
Captured by the Pirate Empress Hancock,

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,680
Luffy battled in mortal combat
with her younger sisters,

56
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,370
Sandersonia and Marigold who had
eaten the Snake-Snake Fruit.

57
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,430
How rude!

58
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,830
Mari! Get him now!

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,190
I can't, Sister Sonia.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,470
We are now... being protected...

61
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,750
...by that man!

62
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,010
You said that you'd rather die
than show it to someone.

63
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,330
"Hancock's Confession
The Sister's Abhorrent Past"

64
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,110
Is it okay, now?

65
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,740
Sister Sonia!

66
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,730
We're sorry, Big Sis!

67
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,080
We're sorry that we lost and
had to be saved by our enemy.

68
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,170
Are you up next?

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,140
That's enough.

70
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,640
I don't feel like it.

71
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,300
Oh, yeah?

72
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,780
I hope that she's not damaged.

73
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,280
Alright then,

74
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,950
these people you turned to stone;
turn them back.

75
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,860
What did you say?

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,790
You can do something, right?

77
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,110
They were just trying to defend me!

78
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,620
They didn't do anything wrong!

79
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,020
Hey, please?!

80
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,750
Yes, indeed,

81
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,630
I can revert them if I want.

82
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,060
But...

83
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,370
You said that you want
to go someplace by ship.

84
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,770
Yes, my crew's waiting for me.

85
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,250
Oh, that's nice.

86
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
But I can only make
one of your wishes come true.

87
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,570
It's either revert them

88
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,310
or help you to get off this island.

89
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,260
Choose one wish and give up on the other!

90
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,870
Snake Princess. You are so...

91
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,550
You can't fool me.

92
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,380
Reveal your true nature, Man.

93
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,360
That's great! Thank you!

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,850
That means you're going to help them, right?

95
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,510
Thank you... very much!!

96
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,550
He doesn't hesitate at all.

97
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,220
How is it that a man who has such great Haki

98
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,060
bows his head in order
to save his benefactors...

99
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,330
Maybe, he is...

100
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,000
Big Sis...

101
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,530
Anyway, that man...

102
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,730
I can't believe he defeated the sisters.

103
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,440
Yes, but...

104
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,640
I don't think Snake Princess will forgive him

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,870
after he was so rude to her

106
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,290
nor will she forgive the people
who let him in to this country.

107
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,850
Margaret!

108
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,120
Sweetpea!

109
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,260
Aphelandra!

110
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,170
Oh, here you all are!

111
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,960
Great! She turned you back from stone!

112
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,760
I was so worried because you
suddenly started to vouch for him.

113
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,180
She's right.

114
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,300
I was afraid of what would happen to you.

115
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,600
Turned us back?

116
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,440
What happened to us?

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,240
I have absolutely no recollection.

118
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,530
Don't you remember?

119
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,770
No I don't...

120
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,070
The next thing I knew, that man
was there and he was really happy.

121
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,530
Oh, I'm so relieved!

122
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,290
I was worried that you were going to die.

123
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,580
No one's here...

124
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,950
Is it all finished now?

125
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,040
Thank you!

126
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,370
Snake Princess!

127
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,010
Um...

128
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,450
Keep dedicating yourself to
your duty to protect our country.

129
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,150
...And that was it.

130
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,010
Great!

131
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,360
When you're turned to stone,

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,690
it's hard to remember what
happened before and after.

133
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,730
I'll tell you what happened.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,100
Margaret.

135
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,840
What happened to the man?

136
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,930
What about Snake Princess?

137
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,130
Did she turn him to stone this time?

138
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,760
I don't know that much,

139
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,210
but it seems like he got
summoned to the Kuja Castle.

140
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,470
What?!

141
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,960
Hey, I want to know!
What do you want from me?

142
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,110
Oh!

143
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,480
Is there a meal after the battle?

144
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,310
If that's what it is, I'll be happy!

145
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,940
What kind of food is popular here?

146
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,520
I bet it's some kind of meat!

147
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,810
I should be thanking you.

148
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,890
Thank you.

149
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,500
No, please!

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,200
"Thank you" isn't something I can eat!

151
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,220
If anybody had seen what's on our backs,

152
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,320
there is no way that we
could stay in this country.

153
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,990
You may come in.

154
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,290
Come inside, Man.

155
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,700
Inside?

156
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,540
Inside of the curtain.

157
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,670
Oh, is that where the food is?

158
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm coming...

159
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh, we're not eating.

160
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,390
Hey, what are you doing
with your clothes off?

161
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,550
As always, you are reacting rudely.

162
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,870
But that's okay.

163
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,510
This is the mark...

164
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,250
...that you said...

165
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,350
...you had seen somewhere.

166
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,870
Take a good look at it, again.

167
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,910
Where did you see this?

168
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,420
Do you know the meaning of this mark?

169
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,150
Answer me, now!

170
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,150
It's not something I want to show people.

171
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
As I suspected, it's a bit different
from what I've seen before.

172
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,950
I have a friend called Hachi
who is a fish-man...

173
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,160
A fish-man?

174
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,160
Yeah.

175
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,880
And he has a similar mark on his forehead

176
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,190
so I thought it was the same.

177
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,220
I don't know anything about your mark.

178
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,970
If he doesn't know, why don't you tell him?

179
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,220
Granny Nyon!

180
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,670
Where did you come in from?

181
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,960
Be honest, Snake Princess.

182
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,310
You have seen clearly
how tolerant that man is.

183
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,060
Don't be afraid.

184
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,650
Tell him everything that you want to share.

185
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,940
You!

186
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,980
You are a pirate,
Monkey D. Luffy, am I right?

187
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,030
Yes, I am.

188
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,070
How do you know about me?

189
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,100
How can you be so casual

190
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,680
after you caused such
a sensation in the world?

191
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,300
Look at this newspaper!
Just days ago, this man...

192
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,210
...at Sabaody Archipelago
near the center sea,

193
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,690
caused a horrific and grave incident

194
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,430
when he dealt a blow to a Celestial Dragon!

195
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,350
Dealt a blow to a Celestial Dragon?

196
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,050
It is a miracle that he was able to get away

197
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,780
from the supreme powers
at the center sea after that.

198
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,850
And in only a couple days,

199
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,360
he arrived here so far away.

200
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,490
It's all beyond our understanding.

201
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,290
W-Who are you?!

202
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,870
I told you!

203
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,830
I was blown away suddenly.

204
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,130
I have no idea where this place is!

205
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,900
Oh, and another thing -

206
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,220
I don't feel sorry for that Celestial Dragon.

207
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,580
That bastard!

208
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,050
Guess what he did to my friend?

209
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,370
T-Then...

210
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,210
it is true that you punched
a Celestial Dragon.

211
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,480
T-There are still...

212
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,910
...foolish people like that...

213
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,820
...in this world?!

214
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,720
The ones who put their lives at risk
to challenge those celestials...

215
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,480
...like him!

216
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,430
Who are you talking about?

217
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,320
I will tell you everything

218
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,140
including the meaning of the symbol

219
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,750
that your fish-man friend
has on his forehead.

220
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,870
Hachi's mark?

221
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,460
This is...

222
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,600
"The Claw of the Celestial Dragon."

223
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,310
It's an emblem of the Celestial Dragons!

224
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,620
People who were fed by
the World Nobles all get...

225
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,820
...this permanent brand to
show that you are subhuman!

226
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,540
Celestial Dragons?

227
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,380
The three of us were...

228
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,330
...once...

229
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,440
...slaves of World Nobles!

230
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,480
You were... slaves?!

231
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,260
It happened when I was 12...

232
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,380
Starboard, all clear.

233
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,100
Port, all clear, too.

234
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,390
Bow, all clear.

235
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,970
High visibility, all serene!

236
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,310
Don't fall into the sea!

237
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,020
Don't make fun of me!

238
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,980
I've become a warrior!

239
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,270
Okay, okay.

240
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,980
We trust you!

241
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,060
That's our Big Sis!

242
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,030
We'll support you!

243
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,900
I bet you're hungry! I brought a snack!

244
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,580
Hancock?

245
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,700
Sonia! Mari! Where are you?

246
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,170
Three of us were taken
from the Kuja pirate ship...

247
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,550
...and we were sold!

248
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,430
From that point,

249
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,430
all we have are terrible memories
that we don't even want to remember.

250
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,840
We saw men for the first time

251
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,110
and they were nothing but figures of horror.

252
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,480
Sister Sonia, calm down!

253
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,290
The memory haunts us.

254
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,700
W-Wow! H-Hey! That's enough!

255
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,050
No need to force the memories!
You don't have to tell me!

256
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,940
It was awful.

257
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,680
There was no hope.

258
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,260
We kept thinking about death!

259
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,990
Hey! You...

260
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,520
But...

261
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,240
...one night four years later,

262
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,230
something happened that made
the World Government tremble.

263
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,280
"Nobody will challenge
the Celestial Dragons."

264
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,440
That was the cardinal rule in their world.

265
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,220
But there was a man who climbed
the Red Line with his bare hands

266
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,880
and slipped into the Celestial
Dragons' Holyland of Marejois.

267
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,160
He was an adventurer who
later led the Fish-Man Pirates,

268
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,660
named Fisher Tiger.

269
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,340
In order to free all the slaves

270
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,860
from the town there his fellow
fish-men were being tortured,

271
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,360
he fought with all his might.

272
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,850
We are free! We are free!

273
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,980
He disliked humans as a species

274
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,190
but he was being fair to all slaves,

275
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,780
and let thousands of slaves
of different species go free.

276
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,210
We prepared to die and ran among the others.

277
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,440
We owe him an immeasurable debt.

278
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,600
Tiger released many fish-men to the sea,

279
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,020
but ones who were slaves had
a mark that cannot be erased.

280
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,530
Tiger has made the World Government his enemy

281
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,990
and he formed the
Sun Pirates with former slaves

282
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,960
and sailed out into the open sea.

283
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,380
As though breaking a curse,

284
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,430
he changed the Celestial Dragon's
emblem on everyone's bodies...

285
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,250
...into the symbol of the sun.

286
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,950
What you thought was similar
to the mark on my back is

287
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,560
the sun symbol of the Sun Pirates.

288
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,540
Yeah, you're right.

289
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,790
The one Hachi has on his
forehead looks like the sun.

290
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,150
Does that mean he was a slave, too?

291
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,210
It doesn't necessarily mean that he was.

292
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,190
The mark is made in such a way
that it is impossible to tell...

293
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,920
...whether they are former slaves or not.

294
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm pretty sure that he once was
a member of the Sun Pirates.

295
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,410
In fact, Fisher Tiger is already dead and...

296
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,520
...the Sun Pirates have split
up into several groups.

297
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,960
Hey, when did you get hurt there?

298
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,260
Oh, this? Don't worry about it.

299
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,650
He has a complicated past, too...

300
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,880
So this is the reason
that the mark on our backs

301
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,190
is similar to the fish-men's mark.

302
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,120
Okay, I pretty much understand.

303
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,690
Surprisingly, when we were slaves,

304
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,870
we were forced to eat Love-Love Fruit

305
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,410
and Snake-Snake Fruit
for their entertainment,

306
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,160
and that enabled us to deceive our nation

307
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,590
and preserve the secret.

308
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,890
If you didn't cover up
Sonia's back at that moment,

309
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,120
it would have been impossible
for us to stay on this island.

310
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,440
I don't want to let anyone
know about our past!

311
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,450
I won't stop at deceiving
our whole nation to hide it!

312
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,380
We won't open ourselves up at any price!

313
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,460
We don't want anybody to
take advantage of us again!

314
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,050
I'm scared of being caught off guard.

315
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,220
It terrifies me. I can't take it!

316
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,720
Big Sis...

317
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,660
Ho!

318
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,970
But this is the first time in a long time

319
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,400
that you've shown your emotions like that.

320
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,460
Recently, I've thought
that the Snake Princess

321
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,110
must have turned to ice or something.

322
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,680
Shut up!

323
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,570
You are a traitor who
left the country behind!

324
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,010
You shut up!

325
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,020
You three were miserable

326
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,200
and didn't know how to
return to this island...

327
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,160
...after you ran away from
the Celestial Dragons!

328
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,090
Who brought you back?!

329
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,350
You should be thankful that
I was living outside of this country!

330
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,470
What you are talking about was a small favor.

331
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,630
What did you say?!

332
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,640
Granny Nyon...

333
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,270
I always keep an eye on
you three as a mother would!

334
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,400
And you call it "small
favor", Snake Princess?

335
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,770
Hey, get your hands off of me! Mari! Sonia!

336
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,300
Are you going to...

337
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,700
...look down on me; a former slave?

338
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,870
Huh?

339
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,090
What are you talking about?

340
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,560
Like I told you - I hate
the Celestial Dragons!

341
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,840
I like you!

342
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,330
Didn't you say that you had one more wish?

343
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,740
All right!

344
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,190
Where do you want to go?
I'll give you a ride!

345
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,030
For real?!

346
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,790
The Kuja Pirates hold a banquet.

347
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,680
When Luffy is mobbed by curious women,

348
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,220
Margaret saves him and takes
him to Granny Nyon's house.

349
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,350
But there, Luffy finds out that
his brother Ace is in trouble,

350
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,780
and he's forced to make a big decision.

351
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,580
On the next episode of One Piece!

352
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,280
"Saving Ace!
The Next Stop: the Great Prison!"

353
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,390
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
