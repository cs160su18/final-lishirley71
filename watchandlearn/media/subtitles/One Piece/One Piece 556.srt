00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,310
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,230
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,110
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,820
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,250
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,120
Super it's getting
pretty exciting, isn't it?!

81
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,380
There are 50,000 enemies. This is the
perfect opportunity to unveil them!

82
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,090
Them?!

83
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,430
What are they, Franky?!

84
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,550
There are 2 new weapons on the Sunny!

85
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,390
Who wants to ride along?

86
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,850
What?! New weapons?!

87
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,640
Three-Sword Style!

88
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,570
Black Rope Dragon Twister!

89
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,450
--It won't stop!
--It's like a cyclone of blades!

90
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,000
--Run! Or you're gonna get cut!
--Don't come after us!

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
It'll chase you to hell's end!

92
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,920
Huh? Where did he go?

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,510
Sky...

94
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,880
...Walk!

95
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,800
Cool! Sanji is in the air!

96
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,760
Diable Jambe...

97
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,140
...Poele a Frire...

98
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,730
...Spectre!

99
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,240
Doesn't matter if there
are 100,000 or 1,000,000!

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,830
We'll just beat them all!

101
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:18,960
"Unveiled! The Secret
Weapons of the Sunny!"

102
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,090
How annoying...

103
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,260
It's not over yet, Moss Head!

104
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,800
You can't top me, Nosebleed!

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,230
Why are they competing against each other?

106
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,530
Ignore them. They're always like that.

107
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,280
Honestly, that side of
them hasn't changed a bit!

108
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,250
Everybody's getting
pretty warmed up, aren't they?

109
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,210
Maybe it's time for them!

110
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,710
--By them, you mean...
--Finally, the new weapons?!

111
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,800
That's right! Follow me!

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,710
We've been waiting for this!

113
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,720
Oh, hey, wait!

114
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,680
G-Guys! Don't leave me alone!

115
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,430
You're bugging me! Go somewhere else!

116
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,890
You go!

117
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,230
Don't push your luck, you bastards!

118
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,570
--Shut up!
--Shut up!

119
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,320
They're too strong...

120
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,500
What did you just say?

121
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Nothing!

122
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,590
The humans are "too strong"?

123
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,680
How dare you call yourself a Fish-Man?

124
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,760
C-Captain!

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,100
I-I'm sorry!

126
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,230
Don't disappoint me.

127
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,390
I don't need a soldier who is afraid of...

128
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,940
...stupid humans!

129
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,410
Why don't you kill Shirahoshi already?

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,880
It's awesome down here!

131
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,720
Did you change something?

132
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,390
There wasn't a "5" or a "6" before!

133
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,600
You're right! And "0" is gone!

134
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,610
It's been renovated!!

135
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,650
I remodeled "0" to  create "5" and "6."

136
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,240
The new weapons are in "4"
which was empty before

137
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,660
and in the newly made "5."

138
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay, hurry up! I wanna see
the new weapons already!

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,670
Alright, alright!

140
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,460
Take a look and be surprised!

141
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,090
Here they are!

142
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,430
Cool!

143
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,850
Let's finish this up already-dosun!

144
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,180
Artillery Unit!

145
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,310
Kill Shirahoshi!

146
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,980
I do not like it!

147
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,650
You want to hurt the world's
favorite Mermaid Princess?!

148
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,530
Party music!

149
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,960
What's going on? It got dark all of a sudden.

150
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,800
It's nice to have you along
on this festival night!

151
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,800
What the...

152
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,710
Is this...

153
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,170
...An amusement park?

154
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,210
Hey, let's dance!

155
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,530
Huh? Were we just dreaming?

156
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,450
Now, set off the fireworks!

157
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,380
This is fun!

158
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,590
It's beautiful!

159
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,430
Hey! I said "Kill the Princess"-bokan!

160
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,770
But...

161
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,180
Dosun-san, we're enjoying
today's joyous festival...

162
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,600
Okay, I cut you already.

163
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,650
What?

164
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,650
Quinto Tierce Fantasia!

165
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,780
Huh?

166
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,460
Ganging up on a weak woman?
You people are a bunch of brutes.

167
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,380
Mil Fleurs...

168
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,930
...Gigantesco Mano...

169
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,600
Legs?!

170
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,060
...Stomp!

171
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,190
Sorry!

172
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,190
--People are screaming outside.
--What's going on?

173
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,700
Hey guys, get out! It's too tight!

174
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,370
You have no interest in the
new weapons! You get off!

175
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,490
I'm here because I'm scared!

176
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,200
I don't wanna be alone, either!

177
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,920
Franky, do we have to wait much longer?!

178
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,720
Don't rush it!

179
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,680
It's all set!

180
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,640
I'm getting excited too!

181
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,560
Wait a minute! I need to
operate this thing so...

182
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,200
It got more spacious!

183
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
What's going on in here?!

184
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,330
Alright, here are the new weapons
on the Soldier Dock of the Sunny!

185
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,580
--I'm excited!
--What's gonna happen?!

186
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,710
It's time to unveil!

187
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,470
Deadly Venom Squad, go!

188
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,970
Even if you got giant legs or arms,

189
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,190
you're dead meat once
you're stung by our venom!

190
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,560
Hold it right there!

191
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,120
The Soldier Dock System!

192
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Channel 4!

193
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,470
--The door opened!
--Destroy that stupid ship!

194
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,060
Black Rhino...

195
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,020
...FR-U 4!

196
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,460
The Soldier Dock System!

197
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,420
Channel 4!

198
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,020
Black Rhino...

199
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,860
...FR-U 4!

200
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,000
Cool! It's a cy-bike!

201
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,840
What is it?! Looks so tough!

202
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,930
What did you say about venom?

203
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,180
What the hell?!

204
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,600
Sting it if you can! This steel monster!

205
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,200
It's super cool, isn't it?!

206
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,280
Stop that guy!

207
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
All right!

208
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,950
Steel on steel!

209
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,870
I'll take care of it!

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,880
Here! Take this!

211
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,570
Hey!

212
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,030
The new number! Channel 5!

213
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,960
Brachio-Tank 5 is here!

214
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,840
It's like a dinosaur! I want it!

215
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,670
It's amazing!

216
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,720
Did you see my great shooting skill?

217
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,220
I bet this thing can do a lot more.

218
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,010
I thought he was a shipwright.

219
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,140
I am Commander Chopper!

220
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,690
I see some enemies at 9 o'clock!

221
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,030
Fire!

222
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,070
Fire!

223
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,200
Fire!

224
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,170
You're so cool, Commander!

225
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,540
Hey, you! Fight!

226
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,430
Wow! They're so strong!

227
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,600
There are only 10 of them but they're
kicking the asses of 100,000.

228
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,270
The Straw Hat Pirates...

229
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,600
Maybe, they can save us all and
the Fish-Man Island for real!

230
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,320
Go, Straw Hat!

231
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,110
Beat Hordy!

232
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,490
You're doing great, Straw Hat!

233
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,070
Boss Jimbei!

234
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,830
If you win, I'll let you eat as
much as you want at my restaurant!

235
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,580
You can drink as much as
you want too, at my bar!

236
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,580
--Straw Hat!
--We're counting on you!

237
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,500
Boss Jimbei!

238
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,550
Don't push your luck!

239
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,220
Come on out, Kraken!

240
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,660
No...

241
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,910
It's huge!

242
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,130
There are only 10 of them!
Just crush them all!

243
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,880
Then it'll finally be over!

244
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,930
Oh no! They got the
mythical monster - Kraken!

245
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,430
Watch out!

246
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,940
Even though the Straw Hats are strong,

247
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,610
they're finished once they
get crushed by that thing!

248
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,110
Oh, it's the Kraken! He'll do
whatever Captain tells him to!

249
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,320
He's as strong as hell!

250
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,080
See how formidable this
deep-sea creature is!

251
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,870
Hey, that's...

252
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,790
What are you doing?!

253
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Kill them already!

254
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,800
I brought you here all the way from
the North Pole! You're my slave!

255
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,640
You have to work for me!

256
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,100
You can do it, can't you?

257
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,490
W-Wait a moment!

258
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,290
Fall back!

259
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,000
Hey, if I remember right, that's...

260
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,420
I don't think there are many others!

261
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,930
Huh? You two know him?!

262
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,850
I didn't expect to see him here.

263
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,810
Oh, hey, Surume!

264
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,770
It's me! Surume!

265
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,860
Oh? Don't you remember me?

266
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,070
How could you forget?!

267
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,200
You became my pet for a
while. I'm your friend!

268
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,910
Oh no, the Sea Bonze is...

269
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,510
Alright, that's enough. Stop!

270
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,470
Good job!

271
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,390
I can't believe it!
You really tamed the monster octopus?

272
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:00,900
Yeah, I'm gonna use him like
experienced people do! Right, Surume?

273
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,700
Let me ride on you again!

274
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,920
He did it!

275
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,290
Luffy-sama!

276
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,440
That tickles! Stop! Surume!

277
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,530
All right, Surume! Let's go!

278
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,040
The Kraken betrayed us!

279
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,630
Stop Kraken!

280
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,540
You stupid octopus!

281
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,180
Go Surume!

282
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,720
Help me, Captain!

283
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,470
Kraken, go that way!

284
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,770
Damn! What's going on?!

285
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,730
The Kraken is totally bonded to Straw Hat!

286
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,370
Listen, Surume! Stay here
and protect Yowahoshi!

287
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,130
I can't believe you knew the Kraken!

288
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm so impressed! You have so many friends!

289
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,010
Yeah?

290
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,810
Um, thank you for doing this, Surume-sama!

291
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,240
There are still a lot of them.

292
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,950
All right! Let's go!

293
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,750
Using their new weapon, Franky, Usopp

294
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,300
and Chopper were making good progress,

295
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,090
until they fell into the trap Daruma,

296
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,360
an officer of the New
Fish-Man Pirates, had laid.

297
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,810
But then, the second of Sunny's
new weapons commences its docking!

298
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,100
A wondrous robot emerged!

299
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

300
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,520
"Iron Pirate!
Here Comes General Franky!"

301
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
