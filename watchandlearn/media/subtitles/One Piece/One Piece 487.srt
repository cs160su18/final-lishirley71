2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,360
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,100
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,030
However, Ace protected Luffy from Akainu's
attack  and lost his life in the process!

62
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,910
And then, Blackbeard turned up
and brought further turmoil!

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,210
This is...!

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,380
That pose is...!

65
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
"The Insatiable Akainu!
Lava Fists Pummel Luffy!"

66
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,210
The HQ building is gonna fall!

67
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,460
Leave your post!

68
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,710
We're dead!

69
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,050
Is this for real?

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,470
Somebody please tell me I'm dreaming!

71
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,810
Over the centuries we've kept
watch  over the seas from there!

72
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,150
I can't believe the fort of
justice the Navy's citadel...

73
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,320
...is crumbling before my eyes!

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,060
Blackbeard is the one who caught
Ace and triggered the war

75
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,710
and now he has Whitebeard's power!

76
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,170
Look, all you people of the world!

77
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,840
Behold me and my power!

78
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,430
What's gonna happen to this world?!

79
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,470
I can feel the power
coursing through my body!

80
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,230
Dammit!

81
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,670
What power! It feels like I could control
everything in the world at my whim!

82
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,390
Bastard!

83
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,450
Hey, what's wrong?!

84
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,480
What are you waiting for?
Doesn't anyone wanna fight?

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,990
I'm willing to fight you to your
hearts' content now! What a shame!

86
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,280
I have no choice.

87
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,370
Then, let's start with...

88
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,870
...sinking Marineford into water!

89
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,580
What did he say?!

90
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,440
Shock Wave!

91
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,660
A building can easily be rebuilt!

92
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,920
But the island of Marineford is located
virtually in the center of the world!

93
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,890
Fleet Admiral!

94
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,400
To protect the people of the world who
are threatened by rampaging villains,

95
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,310
it is important to them that we are here!

96
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,150
Justice that comes from
humanity will never perish!

97
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,950
Don't claim to be able to
sink this place so lightly,

98
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,680
you little punk!

99
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,670
Such noble beliefs! Huh? Fleet Admiral-san!

100
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,970
Well, then:

101
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,220
defend this place--if you can!

102
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,730
Damn!

103
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,990
Hurry up and bring the ship to the
island! We can't leave anyone behind!

104
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,740
Wait for us! We're coming now!

105
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,620
We gotta get out of here alive!

106
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,290
Hurry up, everybody!

107
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,380
The Navy's victory must be unquestionable!

108
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,760
We gotta survive and leave
here as Pops told us to!

109
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,480
Let the pirates know the power
of justice through fear!

110
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,360
--Justice...
--...Through fear...

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,280
We're almost there!

112
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,700
That's right! Now is the chance to
let villains all over the world know!

113
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,450
Our power that will...!

114
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,290
...save the world!

115
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,120
We're safe now!

116
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,710
The power of justice!

117
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,170
The power of justice!

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,210
K-Kizaru!

119
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,970
Now is the chance!

120
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,390
Take Straw boy!

121
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,310
Thank you!

122
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,940
Inazuma!

123
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,820
You better stop, Jimbei!

124
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,070
You pest!

125
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,160
Let's finish this up!

126
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,160
I won't let you go any further!

127
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,880
New Kama Kempo: 44 - Aesthetic Technique!

128
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,840
Laser Surgery Fist!

129
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,400
My nails have melted!

130
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,910
Emporio Ivankov of the Revolutionaries army!

131
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,540
You use strange techniques as they say!

132
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,250
New Kama Kempo: 44 - Aesthetic Technique!

133
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,840
Fat Suctioning Fist!

134
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,590
I like it hot!

135
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,720
I have no time to play with you guys!

136
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,490
Ouch!

137
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,580
I burned my lips, my lips, my lips...

138
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,080
...or not! Because of
my over-applied make-up!

139
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,560
Ouch!

140
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,010
I-Ivan-sama!

141
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,850
You bastards!

142
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,460
Don't let them get away! Shoot!

143
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,030
Isn't this too one-sided?
We already know who won...

144
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,740
Is this really necessary?

145
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,250
Defeat them decisively!

146
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,710
Don't ever let them even
think about challenging us!

147
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,300
What's going on?

148
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,930
We'll let them know...!

149
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,470
...The power of justice that we own!

150
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,350
Destroy them!

151
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,730
Destroy them!

152
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,140
Destroy them!

153
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,160
Destroy them!!

154
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,570
What's this?!

155
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,610
Akainu!

156
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,360
Jimbei! Hand Dragon's son over to me!

157
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,410
I'll have an advantage once we
get to the sea! I can outrun him!

158
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,340
Oh no! It's frozen!

159
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,470
Aokiji!

160
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,810
He's coming!

161
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,150
Looks like you've got nowhere to run!

162
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,860
It's no good!

163
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,640
Straw Hat Luffy!

164
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,580
I got you!

165
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,720
Jimbei!

166
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,970
It went right through Jimbei
and got to Ace's brother!

167
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,290
Are they alive?!

168
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,250
Can't let him hurt anymore!

169
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,560
You're in my way, Jimbei!

170
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,870
Luffy-kun, I'm sorry! I couldn't save you!

171
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,290
You fool! You have to worry
about yourself right now!

172
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,970
I missed a little because you were in my way.

173
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,260
If it hit his heart, it
would've been easier for him.

174
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,970
Don't you think so, Jimbei?

175
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,230
Are you gonna keep protecting
him with a hole in his chest?

176
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,200
He's gonna die soon!

177
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,720
Jimbei, if I don't escape death...

178
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm sorry but could you
look after my brother?

179
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,730
I'm not helping him because
he is your brother!

180
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,740
I have a high regard for Luffy-kun!

181
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,830
I've already made up my mind to save
his life even if it means death!

182
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,470
I won't let him die!

183
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,980
Even if I die,

184
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,690
I won't let Luffy-kun die!

185
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,330
That's nonsense!

186
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,630
Crocodile!

187
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,800
Sables!

188
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,640
Somebody, catch them and
put them on the ship!

189
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,730
Okay!

190
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,640
Crocodile!

191
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,460
You gotta protect the one you wanna protect!

192
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,070
Don't let them have their way!

193
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,650
Catch them!

194
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,370
It's over!

195
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,780
I'm sorry that I got carried away, everyone.

196
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,580
This is the end of Captain Buggy's legend.

197
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Thank you for your support all this time!

198
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,040
Jimbei!

199
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,140
They're not coming down...

200
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,970
What's going on?!

201
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,970
Captain Buggy!

202
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,480
He helped Straw Hat and Jimbei!

203
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,610
That's exactly what I thought!

204
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,950
Huh?

205
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,280
Captain Buggy, you made us
believe that you were gonna run

206
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,910
but you helped your fellow escapee
Straw Hat when it counted!

207
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,160
How beautiful!

208
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,080
You're beautiful and shimmering!

209
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,670
They're being weird again!

210
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,380
Jimbei and Straw Hat!

211
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:40,010
What made you guys fly in the
sky with blood all over you?!

212
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,890
Anyway, why is it so hot here...?

213
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,850
M-Magma!

214
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,040
Thank you, red-nosed man! You helped us!

215
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,880
I don't know what's going
on and I'm not helping you!

216
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,050
But I allowed Luffy-kun to be injured!

217
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,990
He needs to be treated immediately!

218
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,120
Shut up! I'm the one who needs help, fool!

219
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,790
How could we get him treated here...

220
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,960
Did you call me "red-nosed man"?!

221
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,380
They keep getting in my way
when I'm about to get him!

222
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,090
Rose Rondo!

223
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,770
You're fools, one and all!

224
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,490
Do you wanna die to save that Straw Hat brat?

225
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:50,960
We've all seen his limitless tenacity
and power with our own eyes.

226
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,420
He's the one who Ace wanted
to save and Pops approved!

227
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,460
And we're bound to bring
him into the new era!

228
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,010
I thought that you all were better
than that! Not that it matters!

229
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,110
The Whitebeard Pirates!

230
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,360
Akainu!

231
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,860
The degree to which you see him as a
risk - that makes you wanna kill him.

232
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,450
The degree to which we have
high expectations of him -

233
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,960
that makes us wanna protect him.

234
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,160
They're the same, don't you agree?

235
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,190
You guys got me involved again!

236
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,920
Are you even listening?!

237
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,250
H-Hey, Jimbei?

238
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,590
Don't tell me that you're unconscious!
Where should I go now?!

239
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,350
Hey!

240
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,160
Whether he lives or dies,
it's as if he's in hell.

241
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,190
Then we can make him suffer
as we please while he lives!

242
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,480
We can't resolve this
through dialogue anymore.

243
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,900
So be it!

244
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,340
W-We're dead!

245
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,790
It's Sengoku vs. Blackbeard over there.

246
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,640
And it's Akainu vs. the commanders over here!

247
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,690
The fighting hasn't stopped!

248
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,820
Captain Buggy! Do something!

249
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,030
Damn it all, fools!

250
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,640
Give me a break... Honestly!

251
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,520
Captain, we reached the
point where it's not frozen.

252
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,060
Surface.

253
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,790
What is that?! The ship came out of water!

254
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,210
That's a submarine!

255
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,420
Is that another enemy?

256
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,850
Whose ship is that?

257
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,340
Put Straw Hat-ya on my ship!

258
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,550
"Straw Hat-ya"? That's really
a strange way to call somebody!

259
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,600
Who the hell are you, brat?!

260
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,880
Straw Hat-ya will become
my enemy at some stage

261
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,000
but a desirable relationship
is still a relationship.

262
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,520
There's no point in letting him die here.

263
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,360
THE HEART PIRATES--CAPTAIN TRAFALGAR LAW

264
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,610
I'm gonna help him get out of here.

265
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,360
Let me take care of him for now!

266
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,900
W-What?!

267
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,950
I'm a doctor!

268
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,960
The Navy's relentless pursuit continues.

269
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,590
As the meaningless battle rages on endlessly,

270
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,990
one young man stands lost
in grief on the battlefield.

271
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,250
That sadness gives birth to
a great power called courage,

272
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,730
setting the very world in motion!

273
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,120
On the next episode of One Piece!

274
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,150
"The Desperate Scream! Courageous
Moments that Will Change the Future"

275
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
