Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,610
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,720
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,510
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

74
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,580
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,050
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,050
The Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

78
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,050
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

79
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,000
and landed on Punk Hazard;

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,140
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen.

81
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,300
They learned about the ruler
of the island and the puppeteer

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,540
of Shinokuni - Caesar Clown's motive

83
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,610
and along with their pirate ally -
the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

84
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,880
they are caught in a climactic
battle in order to

85
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,450
kidnap Caesar, save the children,
and escape from the island.

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,920
What's that?!

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,760
"Running Wild!
Invincible General Franky!"

88
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,640
General Left!

89
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,720
You okay, Buffalo?!

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,460
What is that-dasuyan?!

91
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,730
How do I know?!

92
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,060
Can't believe it's just
shooting at us like that!

93
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,400
Again?!

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,140
What is that?! A Pacifista?!

95
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,340
No, it can't be!

96
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,110
Caesar has no interest in human weapons!

97
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,950
Buffalo!

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,750
Alright! I don't know what it is but...

99
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,160
...if it wants a fight,
that's what it'll get!

100
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't know what it
was but I destroyed it!

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,090
THE THIRD LABORATORY- R BUILDING

102
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,570
Everybody, hurry up! Get on the truck!

103
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,140
--Get on the front car, too!
--Watch your step!

104
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,040
--Kids, come on!
--Hurry up!

105
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,540
The building will collapse soon!

106
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,080
--I can't climb!
--Come on, you can do it!

107
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,520
They're not here yet.

108
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,620
Yeah, that's not good.

109
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,920
It's dangerous here. We have no time!

110
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,920
Hey, where does this passage lead to?

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,660
If we go through, we'll reach a harbor
that has a tanker docked in it.

112
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,670
That deadly gas is covering the island!
Are we gonna be okay?!

113
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,830
Yes, we have to risk
exposure to the air outside

114
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,670
in order to get on the tanker

115
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,570
but isn't it better than
being buried under some wreckage?

116
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,210
But the children...

117
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,310
We'll be fine, Sis!

118
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,660
We want to get out!

119
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,580
Get out and go home!

120
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,190
She's right! We can make
it if we hold our breath!

121
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,290
We want to see our fathers and mothers!

122
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
Please! Take us with you!

123
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,900
Please!

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,920
You're right. When it comes to this,

125
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,470
we have no choice but
to leave it to fate!

126
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,310
Kids! We'll make it
through this at any cost!

127
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,940
You have to survive this and go home!

128
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,540
Yeah!

129
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,190
Now, let's go and
recover Caesar-dasuyan!

130
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,560
Okay, I can't believe we
got sidetracked like this!

131
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,680
General I'm-Okay!

132
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,480
No damage at all?!

133
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,380
No way!

134
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,020
Take this! Now's my chance!

135
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,650
General...

136
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,360
...Shield!

137
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Too slow and too small!

138
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,190
Too slow? Too small?!

139
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,060
Are you saying...

140
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,700
...that I'm too dull and
I have no tactical skills?!

141
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,700
No, I didn't.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,370
Don't underestimate General
Franky, the pervert robot!

143
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,280
General Shield...

144
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,740
You're trying to make up your mind now?!

145
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,420
Oh, um, what should I do...

146
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,220
Boomerang!

147
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,480
--He threw his shield!
--Is he desperate?!

148
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,100
My "toy" wasn't enough for you, was it?

149
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,360
All right!

150
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,670
If you're not letting us recover Caesar,
you're our enemy!

151
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Hm? What is she doing?

152
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,270
She gave up fighting?

153
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,380
The real fight starts now.

154
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,120
Weapon-morphosis!

155
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,800
What the hell is that?

156
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Espada Girl!

157
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,310
Buffalo, ready?!

158
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,380
Dasuyan!

159
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,280
Dasuyan! Dasuyan! Dasuyan!

160
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,090
Dasuyan! Dasuyan!
Dasuyan! Dasuyan! Dasuyan...

161
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,020
Interesting!

162
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,660
General Shield Boomerang!

163
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,190
That's nothing!

164
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,100
I'm at full blast-dasuyan!

165
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,370
Not bad! Weapon Girl and Fan Man!

166
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,240
Are you trying to fight
against my weapon?!

167
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,810
I'm just trying to protect the Sunny!

168
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,030
General Left!

169
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,350
The Young Master said
"immediately"-dasuyan!

170
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,430
I know! I'll finish him
off with a single blow!

171
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,030
Missile Girl!

172
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,630
--You ready-dasuyan?!
--Go ahead!

173
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,500
Dasuyan!

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,030
Spin-Spin Projectile Cannon!

175
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,500
We'll take Caesar with us!

176
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,040
What are you talking about?! Caesar?!

177
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,140
General Left!

178
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,090
Now that was a dramatic finish.

179
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,970
Where am I?

180
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,260
I can't move! Damn! Am I going to die?!

181
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,860
Dammit! It's all because of them!

182
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,260
The Navy G-5 Vice
Admiral Smoker's heart!

183
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,700
What a nice gift, Law.

184
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,970
The fight is over.

185
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,550
Smoker! The least I can do is...

186
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,120
...take you along to hell with me!

187
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,030
It's a shame that I
can't watch him dying!

188
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,300
He'll open his eyes wide,
spew up blood and suffocate in no time!

189
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,470
It'll cause fear and panic
in all those he's with!

190
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,200
I get excited just by imagining it...

191
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,510
The door's starting to close!
Who did that?!

192
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,910
Hey, what is that?

193
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,090
The deadly gas!

194
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,660
Hurry up! Get on now!

195
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,410
Hey, what're you guys
doing, Straw Hats?!

196
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,250
All of you, get on now!

197
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,720
If we let Caesar get away,
our plan will be ruined!

198
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,160
What're you talking about?!
This is not "all of us"!

199
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,860
Some of my crew are not here yet!

200
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,660
Mocha is not here, either!

201
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,500
Some of our soldiers
are not here, either!

202
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,550
THE PATH BETWEEN BUILDING B AND R

203
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,560
Hurry up, Chopper! Brook!

204
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,630
Okay, I'll hurry, Usopp!

205
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,530
We are the ones who are running!

206
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,730
Outrun the gas somehow!

207
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,670
Hurry up! 50 meters to go!

208
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,070
R BUILDING 2ND FLOOR - THE SECRET ROOM

209
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,500
The gate is closing! Slide in!

210
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
This building is gonna collapse soon!

211
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,780
I better go, too!

212
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,510
Oh no! I completely forgot about
the Sea Prism Stone handcuffs!

213
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,210
Hey guys, I don't think you know where

214
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,320
they are but I'm looking
for the Sea Prism Stone...

215
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,820
These, young man?!

216
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,750
How easy!

217
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,220
Yeah, there are a lot of them!

218
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,420
I don't need that many!

219
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,720
But I'm glad that I asked!

220
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,290
Are you gonna go downstairs?!

221
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,430
It's too mortifying to die here
because of that jerk!

222
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,670
We'll come with you!

223
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,230
Do as you like!

224
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,870
Chopper, Brook! Get clear safely!

225
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,440
The gate is gonna close!

226
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,840
--Damn! We're dead!
--We can't make it!

227
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,140
It's only over when you give up!

228
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,910
We'll survive at any cost!

229
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,620
--But the deadly gas is...
--It's the end!

230
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,550
Luffy!

231
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,350
It's them!

232
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,590
Hey, everybody!

233
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,590
Mocha!

234
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,500
What a relief!

235
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
Hey!

236
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,030
We made it!

237
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,500
--Okay, we're all here!
--You had us worried!

238
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,270
I'm glad that you made it!

239
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,910
Yeah, thanks to you, Usopp!

240
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,740
We were the ones who ran like hell!

241
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,810
We have no time! Hurry up!

242
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,450
Get on, everybody!
This place is gonna collapse!

243
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,950
Hear that?! Get on the truck, you...

244
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,450
Huh?! Where did they go?!

245
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,090
Let's go!

246
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,020
That's fast!

247
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,330
Hurry up!

248
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,960
Let's get out of here, guys!

249
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,500
Yeah!

250
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,270
Hey, what should we do?!
What should we do about Kin'emon-san?!

251
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,700
What?! Kin'emon?!

252
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,940
What can we do? I mean, he's like...

253
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,240
Ki... Kin'emon?!

254
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,000
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

255
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,890
Ring, ring, ring... Clank!

256
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,260
Joker... Can you hear me?

257
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,040
It's...

258
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,810
...Monet.

259
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,420
Monet. I can't believe you're alive.

260
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,830
Vergo's been beaten.

261
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,020
Caesar, too.

262
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,660
But Baby 5 and Buffalo
will probably recover him.

263
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,930
Oh. That's good to hear.

264
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,060
It's all because of my misjudgment.

265
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,770
I feel bad for you all.

266
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,810
But I want to make sure
to wipe out all those squirts now.

267
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,210
Yee-haw!

268
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,320
At the Third Laboratory,

269
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,380
there is another weapon
that was responsible for

270
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,790
destroying the First
and Second Laboratory

271
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,590
and the rest of the
island four years ago.

272
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,560
With just the push of a button,

273
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,170
there will be only one survivor on the whole island.

274
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,100
No one else can take
that highly toxic gas.

275
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
And that's Caesar!

276
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,340
The button is at...

277
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,140
You don't have to say it, Joker.

278
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,280
I was gonna do that, anyway.

279
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm right in front of
the triggering device.

280
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,060
The explosion will ruin the tanker
that they're planning on escaping with.

281
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,460
You're gonna lose one of your tankers -
is it okay?

282
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,630
Thank you.

283
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,140
I need you to perish along
with everything else.

284
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,140
Understood.

285
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,220
Young Master.

286
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,450
I'll make you realize my anger!
Go to hell, Smoker!

287
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,090
I'm sorry, partner.

288
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,590
I've known you the longest.

289
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,400
Thank you for all your work.

290
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,720
Goodbye, Young Master.

291
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,500
I know you will become...

292
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,710
...the King of the Pirates.
