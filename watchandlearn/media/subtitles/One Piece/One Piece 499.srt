2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,230
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,900
Luffy was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,240
However, 10 years ago,

62
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,700
Ace, Sabo and Luffy were competing

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,080
to hunt the big tiger to
decide who would be captain.

64
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,380
They met a former pirate
- Naguri who knew Roger,

65
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,200
and he agreed to give Luffy
tips on how to become a pirate.

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,640
"The Battle against the Big Tiger!
Who is Going to be Captain?!"

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,500
Why do you always do that?!

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,680
You always attack so openly!

69
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,880
Shut up! What about you?!

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,820
That was horrible!

71
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,060
Let's put some poisonous
mushrooms in the bait tomorrow.

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,260
Oh, wait a minute.

73
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,830
He's big but still a member
of the cat family...

74
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,820
That means catnip might work, huh?

75
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,710
Huh?!

76
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,890
I wonder how Luffy is doing.

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,050
It's been a week since he left the hideout.

78
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,090
We should have gone to see him by now.

79
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,000
You know how he is.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,530
Maybe the training is too hard for him
and he's crying "I wanna go home!"

81
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,350
No! Maybe he's dead already!

82
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
What?

83
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,280
Don't you care about Luffy?
He's your younger brother!

84
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,000
Shut up! I don't care if
he's crying or he's dead!

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,640
Damn! Stop being stubborn already!

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,930
You must...

87
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,060
Ow, ow, ow...

88
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,630
W-What happened?

89
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,370
I'm sorry!

90
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,230
Are you okay? Sorry!

91
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,360
--Luffy!
--Luffy!

92
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,650
Ace! Sabo! Long time no see!

93
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,870
How've you been?!

94
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,760
Uh, well, you know.

95
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,890
GRAY TERMINAL

96
00:06:53,890 --> 00:07:00,640
TIGER

97
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,900
What's that? A target?

98
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,640
Hey, Sabo!

99
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,690
I'm gonna show you the result of my training!

100
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,960
Here I go!

101
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,110
Gum-Gum...

102
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,430
...Pistol!

103
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Oh no!

104
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,720
That's awesome! You couldn't
reach that far a week ago!

105
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,200
Can you beat that?!

106
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,050
Oh boy...

107
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,800
What kind of tips did you give him?

108
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,780
Nothing special.

109
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,600
He was just chopping wood
with an ax for me everyday.

110
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,650
But maybe it helped him
build up his physique.

111
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,570
Let me have a seat.

112
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,700
We challenged Roger, the King
of the Pirates, to a fight!

113
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,620
Really?!

114
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,500
But we lost the fight and split up.

115
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,210
I know that you hate him, too.

116
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,220
Hate who?

117
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,380
Because he beat you.

118
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,320
You mean Roger?

119
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,180
I felt frustrated for sure.

120
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,440
But I lost because I wasn't strong enough.

121
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,330
I rather feel grateful to him now.

122
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,690
To someone who beat you?!

123
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,260
That's right.

124
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,660
We give up! You win!

125
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,210
Go ahead and cut my head off! But...

126
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,760
Please spare my crew in exchange for my head!

127
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,580
Captain!

128
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,310
Have mercy!

129
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,730
He was a man of quite high caliber!

130
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,210
That's why I...

131
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,320
Don't lie! There are dozens
of people who hate him!

132
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,750
Do they really fight with Roger?

133
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,760
In the world of pirates, when you
lose a fight, you lose your life.

134
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,260
But I'm alive.

135
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,180
Let's say that those people fought him.

136
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,850
Just think. They can talk about
their grudges because they're alive!

137
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,180
I'll get stronger and...

138
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,760
Then what if Roger had a son?!

139
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,570
It must be hard to be his son.

140
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,740
Whether he chooses to live a
normal life or as a pirate,

141
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,250
he will always be haunted
by his father's name.

142
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,540
It must be quite hard.

143
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,630
If I were his son, I wouldn't
want to become a pirate.

144
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,180
Because that father's name would
ruin his son's life in the end.

145
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,510
"Ruin his son's life"?!

146
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,850
Stop talking nonsense!
You don't know anything!

147
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,820
Why don't you fight me, old man?!

148
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Ace!

149
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,110
Like I said, when you lose a
fight, you lose your life...

150
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm not gonna lose!

151
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,470
I win!

152
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,340
Dammit! Do anything you like with me!

153
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,930
Then, I want you to come with me.

154
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,040
Huh?

155
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,840
It's this way!

156
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,700
I didn't know that there was a cove.

157
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,200
Guys! Hurry up and get over here!

158
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,540
Guys! Guys! Hustle, hustle!

159
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,630
What do you want, Luffy?

160
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,740
Don't be shocked!

161
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,220
That's a...

162
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,760
...boat?!

163
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,850
Isn't it cool?! It's a real pirate ship!

164
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,730
A pirate ship?! Is this what
Naguri has been making?!

165
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,730
It will take forever to make it on my own.

166
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,280
Could you two give me a hand?

167
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,240
--Huh?
--Give you a hand?

168
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,320
You said that I can do
anything I like with you!

169
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,080
W-W-Wait a minute! I have to help, too?!

170
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,880
You happened to be here, so.

171
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,790
You're not making any sense!

172
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,460
We're busy hunting the big tiger!

173
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,680
I can give you some pointers
to hunt the tiger.

174
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
What?! Well, then maybe...

175
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,310
Let me ask you a question.

176
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,960
What are you gonna do with the ship?

177
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,320
I'm gonna go out to sea, of course.

178
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,690
To find my crew that got split up.

179
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,510
To sea?

180
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,820
What? An old man can't go out to sea?

181
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,910
No, I wasn't gonna say that, but...

182
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,410
It doesn't matter how old
you are to chase a dream!

183
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,640
I don't care what anyone says,
I'm gonna go out to sea!

184
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,920
I've already decided!

185
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,670
Do you have a problem with that?

186
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Nope!

187
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,260
You're an old man, full of energy.

188
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,080
Ace?

189
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,930
A promise is a promise. I'll
give you a hand. And...

190
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,520
...I will defeat you tomorrow!

191
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,680
What was that?

192
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,740
And so began their training
to be pirates with Naguri.

193
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,120
Through hard labor on the ship,

194
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,300
they gained strength and honed their
skills by fighting with Naguri...

195
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,390
...growing both physically and mentally.

196
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:55,680
Seasons come and go but spring
comes late in the Gray Terminal.

197
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,840
--I'm gonna win today!
--I'm not gonna lose!

198
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,530
I'm gonna win!

199
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,280
Gum-Gum...

200
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,740
...Pistol!

201
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,040
Oh no!

202
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,050
Hey, Luffy! You did it again!

203
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,900
Sorry!

204
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:33,850
Boy, you guys are only thinking
about getting stronger but...

205
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,770
...you think that's enough?

206
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,600
What do you mean?

207
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,400
The strongest one among
us will become captain.

208
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,860
So what do you think about that?

209
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,820
That's right! The one that kill the tiger!

210
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,150
The tiger, huh?

211
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,670
Well, a captain needs to be
strong - that's for sure.

212
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,290
But there is more important thing.

213
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,580
A more important thing?

214
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,540
Yes, and that is...

215
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,090
I forgot!

216
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,560
What was that? How disappointing!

217
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,600
Easy, easy!

218
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,350
Oh, I didn't know that
you were here, Ace-kun.

219
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
What's wrong?

220
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,730
What does it take to be a captain?

221
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,610
What is more important than being strong?

222
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,890
Tell me!

223
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,620
Alright.

224
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,040
That is...

225
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,460
To tell you the truth, I don't know it yet.

226
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,560
I wasn't a good captain.

227
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,140
But my crew,

228
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,850
they called me "Captain"
until the last minute.

229
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:47,440
Because of that, I'm still the
captain of the Naguri Pirates.

230
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,820
Only your crew's approval
can make you a captain!

231
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,500
Or something like that...

232
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,090
That's corny.

233
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,840
Yeah! It's done!

234
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,930
We did it, Naguri!

235
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,390
Cool! It's awesome!

236
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,020
I couldn't have done it
without your help. Thank you!

237
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,770
I'm really grateful!

238
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,980
Say, Naguri, are you setting sail soon?

239
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,780
Yes. But before that, I have
to wrap up your training.

240
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,400
Let's go and hunt the big tiger today!

241
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,660
Really?!

242
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,630
I'm gonna kill him and
end this stupid training!

243
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,460
I'm gonna kill him!

244
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,550
Don't forget about me!

245
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,120
Here he comes!

246
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,240
There he is!

247
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,450
I go first!

248
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,080
How predictable!

249
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,840
How's that?!

250
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,140
You're unguarded!

251
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,900
You gotta fight me now!

252
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,980
Stop resisting, just give up!

253
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,050
Sabo! Ace!

254
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,460
D-D-Dammit!

255
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,690
Gum-Gum Pistol!

256
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh no! Luffy!

257
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,890
Run!

258
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,360
Ace! Sabo!

259
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,910
So heavy! How powerful he is!

260
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,920
Damn! We're not good enough!

261
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,110
Only your crew's approval
can make you a captain!

262
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,510
But we can't lose!

263
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,470
Guys, give me a hand!

264
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,680
Oh, it's getting interesting.

265
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,650
We're not fast enough but we
can do it with Luffy's power!

266
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,480
Sabo, do it!

267
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,530
Okay! Hey, tiger! Look over here!

268
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,430
Kiss my ass!

269
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,960
--Luffy!
--Okay!

270
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,260
Pull it as much as you can!

271
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,000
Sabo, this way!

272
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,960
I can't! He's gonna eat me!

273
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,800
You can do it, Sabo!
Lure him as far as you can!

274
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,480
Are you ready, Luffy?!

275
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,430
Yeah!

276
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,110
Gum-Gum...

277
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,650
...Rocket!

278
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,090
Yeah!!

279
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,810
So, Ace is gonna be our captain after all?!

280
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,520
I worked so hard for this!

281
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,310
Give it up, Luffy.

282
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,680
Damn!

283
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,060
Don't worry. I'm not gonna become captain.

284
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,940
Why?

285
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,450
Because I didn't beat
the tiger all by myself.

286
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,200
Ace!

287
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,160
Well, I mean,

288
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:57,450
I'm gonna make you guys
beg me to become captain sometime soon!

289
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,670
Are you gonna beg him?

290
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,190
Hell no!

291
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,250
You fools!

292
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,590
Looks like everything
turned out for the best.

293
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,010
Alright then...

294
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,550
Old man!

295
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,180
Next time I see you, I'm gonna defeat you!

296
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,050
Keep winning until then!

297
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,440
Goodbye!

298
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,400
Take care!

299
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,110
I'll be waiting for you out there.

300
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,760
Thus, they said goodbye to Naguri

301
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,440
and Luffy and the other two
returned to life on their own.

302
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,480
Hey, you know where he is, don't you?

303
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,720
Yes. You don't have to worry.

304
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,740
It's about time now.

305
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,990
Call and tell his father that we found...

306
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,280
...Sabo.

307
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,920
Sabo makes a difficult
decision in order to save

308
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,260
Ace and Luffy, who are being held hostage.

309
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,160
But Sabo is overwhelmed by the suffocating

310
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,400
lifestyle in High Town.

311
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,140
Then, as if to deal the final blow,
yet another scheme is revealed...

312
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,190
"Freedom Taken Away! The Nobles'
Plot Closing in on the Brothers!"

314
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,530
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
