2
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,430
The exit is real close now. We'll keep
on going and go down in one shot!

3
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,350
What? No way... What?!

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,440
All right! The sea train has come out!

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,400
Guys! Now we're gonna charge forth, too!

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,110
Yeah!

7
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,900
Jump! Sodom! Gomorrah!

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,570
Straw Hat!

9
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:06,960
Thank you for helping us,
the entire Franky Family!

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,970
Whoa! Cool!

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,350
Those must be the highest-grade bulls.

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,020
I decided to go with you guys.

13
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,940
The enemy who took your friend away

14
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,900
is also the culprit who tried to kill Iceberg-san.

15
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,490
In addition, there are lots of
things that I wanna say to them!

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,660
Well, then...

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,830
Although we got in fights back in
town with both the Franky Family

18
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,040
and the Galley-La shipwrights,
we're all going after the same enemy now.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,210
This is bad!

20
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,670
I told you, didn't I?

21
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,090
My job ended when the train got on the railway.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,140
No one can stop it anymore.

23
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,290
Hey, Luffy!

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,190
When we have the same goal...

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,940
...it's senseless to fight separately.

26
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,320
Listen. We're comrades.

27
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,150
Guys! Don't let that big wave beat us!

28
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,780
We'll all achieve our goal!

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,160
Let's go!

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,660
Yeah!

31
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,880
Now, guys! Show me what
you can do about this wave!

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,770
All right! Fire all the cannonballs
we have at the wave!

33
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,420
When it comes to cannons, leave it to me!

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,780
Franky Family! Don't be
intimidated by the wave!

35
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,400
Prepare the cannons!

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,010
Roger!

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,770
Get a move on!

38
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah!

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,620
Ah! The portable transponder snail is ringing!

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,280
It's from Sanji-kun!

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,800
Wh-What the hell...

42
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,260
The same thing here!

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,850
They were all taken out!

44
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,200
It's all right! Now let's move forward

45
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,620
with the sun always in our hearts

46
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,000
As power passes through our clasped hands

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,290
let's grab hold of our wishes

48
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:07,680
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,860
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

50
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,820
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:28,950
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

52
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,460
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

53
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,290
but what you cherish most will be right there

54
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,340
And if you get into a jam

55
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,340
I'll always be there to protect you

56
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,060
with the sun always in our hearts

58
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,310
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

59
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,570
and gaze at the light beyond

60
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,280
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

61
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,570
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

62
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,990
So let's grab hold of our wishes

63
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,410
under the same flag-- together, we're one

64
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,750
One Piece

65
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,100
"Smash the Wave! Luffy and Zoro
Use the Strongest Combo!"

66
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,120
Hey, you!

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,040
Yes, Captain T-Bone!

68
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,540
That wound... What happened to your arm?

69
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,710
Hm...? Oh...

70
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,960
I got bitten by a bug earlier.
When I scratched the area, it bled.

71
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,210
That's not good! We should
stop the bleeding immediately!

72
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,390
--Ahh!
--Let's make do with this.

73
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,390
Y-You tore your precious cape!

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,850
"Justice"

75
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,890
Now, this should do.

76
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,420
When my subordinates bleed,
it's my heart that gets wounded.

77
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,850
Captain T-Bone...

78
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,650
May the world be in peace
and kindness again today.

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
His face is super scary.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,210
--Captain!
--What'd you say?!

81
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,290
I... I haven't said anything.

82
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,630
If it's something I can do, I'll do it,
even if my body gets destroyed.

83
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,840
Er... Well...

84
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,760
The officials in car #6 and #7
have been wiped out.

85
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,430
In addition, the two criminals
detained in car #6 are missing as well.

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,350
What?!

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,520
We can't tell whether there's an intruder
or they escaped by themselves.

88
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,360
For Heaven's sake! Save the lives
of the injured immediately,

89
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,490
and let everyone on this train
know about this situation!

90
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,030
Yes, sir!

91
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,080
Nami-san! Nami-san, can you hear me?

92
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,910
Yep, is that you, Sanji-kun?!

93
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,170
Things are taking a turn for the worse here.

94
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,730
Turn for the worse?

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,300
Sanji-kun! What was that voice?!

96
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,220
Hey! What's going on?! Sanji-kun!

97
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,590
Hey, hey...

98
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,260
Yeah, because of that idiot...

99
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,080
I-Idiot?

100
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,640
Ah! Again! What?!

101
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,600
--Are you okay?!
--What's going on?!

102
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,980
--Just kidding.
--Are you okay, Sanji-kun?

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,440
--But you look panicky.
--Who's the idiot you're talking about?!

104
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,730
Actually, there are two idiots.

105
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,330
Demi-Cannon!

106
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,410
Take these!

107
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
We're not even making a dent.
Should have expected as much.

108
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
No! Those puny cannons won't work!

109
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,340
Guys! Stay back!

110
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,370
Leave it to the Franky Family's special cannon!

111
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,890
Target! Aqua Laguna!

112
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,390
Fire! Super Scrap Cannon!

113
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,600
Dammit! Don't flinch! Keep firing!

114
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,870
Replenish the cannonballs!

115
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,620
Got it!

116
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,130
Aim at the front! Focus on one spot!

117
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,970
Go! Focus pocus!

118
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,010
Do your best. The railway surfaces a little,
but we can't go over Aqua Laguna.

119
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,600
If we directly hit it, even Rocketman
will easily get destroyed.

120
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,060
Ahhh! Are we gonna die?!

121
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,520
I told you to prepare yourselves, right?

122
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,480
What?! That includes us?!

123
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,820
I see... Then Robin is still...

124
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,330
At any rate, it sounds lively over there.

125
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,010
Say, Sanji-kun...

126
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,170
I'll tell you the reason for Robin's actions

127
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,630
and our current situation, so...

128
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,300
Be quiet!

129
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,760
Listen, Sanji-kun. I'll tell you everything
about the reason for Robin's actions

130
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,560
and our current situation.
So please listen carefully.

131
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,350
Ahhh! We're gonna crash!

132
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,940
Oh, no! We're gonna die!

133
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,150
We're gonna die!

134
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,320
If you have time to whine, keep firing!

135
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,100
Find a way out!

136
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,570
Hey, Luffy.

137
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,230
Yeah... Let's go, Zoro.

138
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Hey! Keep firing at the front!

139
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,880
What're you guys gonna do?!

140
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,260
We'll fire...

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,100
...a cannon.

142
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,570
What's a hundred and eight times two?

143
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,330
Two hundred and sixteen.

144
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,710
Two hundred and sixteen...
That's long and hard to say.

145
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,740
Then, pick whatever.

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,420
Wh-What are they doing?!

147
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,930
One is weaponless and the other is
using swords. What're they trying to do?

148
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,800
They told us to keep firing.

149
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,100
Enough talking! Just back them up!

150
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,770
Yeah!

151
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,110
Okay, then... three hundred!

152
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,800
Okay!

153
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,650
Gum-Gum...

154
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,610
Three-Hundred Pound...

155
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,200
We're gonna crash!

156
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,750
...Cannon!

157
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,510
Yeah!

158
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,440
Okay, then... three hundred!

159
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,090
Okay!

160
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,230
Gum-Gum...

161
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,690
Three-Hundred Pound...

162
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,610
We're gonna crash!

163
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,750
...Cannon!

164
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,820
Sanji-kun!

165
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,650
We're gonna die!

166
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,360
It's finally time.

167
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,270
W-We got through!

168
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,620
We got through Aqua Laguna!

169
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,080
I thought we were gonna die!

170
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,650
Yay!

171
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,270
Ow...

172
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,320
Hey! Are you okay, Nami-san?

173
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,940
Yeah, somehow...

174
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,910
That was really something. They don't
call themselves pirates for nothing.

175
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,710
If they were our enemy, they'd be fearsome,

176
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,860
but if they're on our side, no one
is more dependable than they are!

177
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,750
Straw Hat!

178
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,630
Naturally, I was prepared to die.
What incredible guys...

179
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,430
Don't let your guard down.
We are not through the storm yet.

180
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,100
Yeah!

181
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,310
There's nothing that we're afraid of now!

182
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,860
That was fun!

183
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,440
Straw Hat! You're amazing!

184
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,570
That was beyond human power!

185
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,420
Oh, sorry.

186
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,410
Luffy, come over here.

187
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,490
--Hm?
--Hm?

188
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,670
It's Sanji-kun.

189
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,340
Hey, is that you, Luffy?

190
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,600
Oh, Sanji! How's it going
over there? Where's Robin?

191
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,640
Robin-chan is still in their custody.

192
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,770
Nami-san just told me
the reasons for her actions.

193
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,730
Yeah, I heard... everything.

194
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,010
I see.

195
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,700
Yeah... Well... that's what's going on.

196
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,410
Go ahead and give them hell.

197
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:17,870
What?!

198
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,750
Whaaat?!

199
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,790
Hey!

200
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,720
Don't be reckless, Luffy!

201
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,460
Tell him to wait until we catch up!

202
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,340
Hey, Cook! Can you hear me?!
There are crazy guys on that train, so...

203
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,420
That's okay.

204
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,500
Zoro...

205
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,390
What would you do if it were you?

206
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,420
Hm?

207
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,060
After hearing that Robin lied and was
taken into custody in order to save us,

208
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,560
could you just stay put?

209
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,900
It's no use trying to stop him.

210
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,320
You know me well.

211
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,410
Hey, Moss Head! Are you worried about me?

212
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,160
Why would I be, you idiot?!

213
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,640
But sorry...

214
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,630
After hearing what Robin-chan was thinking...

215
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:14,510
...even if the Captain orders it,
I'm not gonna stop!

216
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,880
Ahhh!

217
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,910
Why'd you break it?! I wanted
to ask Straw Hat something, too!

218
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,640
Huh...? Who cares?

219
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,810
You should've told me beforehand.

220
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,650
Even if I didn't tell you, it was obvious,
wasn't it?! Don't be so cocky!

221
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,270
I'm not being cocky.

222
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,190
I wonder if he'll be okay.

223
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,620
Granny! Have the train go faster!

224
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,490
Faster?

225
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah! Like, more wooosh!

226
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,840
Don't worry. It's already going
faster than the limits of its speed...

227
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,920
So fast that it can't stop by itself.

228
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,250
So, things like that were happening...

229
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,180
...while I was gone?

230
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,360
Robin-chan doesn't know anything

231
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,660
about the Merry... or about the
huge fight between you and Luffy.

232
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,940
In order for all six of us,
including you, to stay safe,

233
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,300
she sacrificed herself and obeyed their orders.

234
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,600
She did it for us.

235
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,470
What a moving story!

236
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,550
Why are you crying?

237
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,200
You dummy! I'm not crying!

238
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,320
Dammit! I can't believe it!

239
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,930
Nico Robin is said to be a
cruel, inhuman, evil woman!

240
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,380
But the truth is... she's got touching
affection towards her friends!

241
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,370
Robin-chan is within a stone's throw.
Anyhow, I'll go rescue her!

242
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,340
All right, then! I'm Franky,
the leader of the Franky Family!

243
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,890
I'll give you a hand, mister eyebrow!

244
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,380
To tell you the truth, I've got
a reason for not wanting Robin

245
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,760
to be in the Government's custody, too.

246
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,060
Most of all, when I hear such a poignant tale...!

247
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,250
Hey! Let's go, Long-nose!

248
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,690
I'm...

249
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,690
...not coming.

250
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,700
It no longer has anything to do with me, right?

251
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,010
If the World Government itself
becomes your enemy at last,

252
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,060
I don't wanna be part of it.

253
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,360
You'll join with Luffy and
the others as well, right?

254
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,170
After all my blustering,
and after humiliating myself,

255
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,220
how could I be with you guys?!

256
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:03,050
I'm sorry, but I'm no longer
honor-bound to go rescue Robin!

257
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,180
I left the Straw Hats!

258
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,060
See ya.

259
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,110
H-Hey! "See ya," you're saying?!

260
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,860
There's no place to escape to!

261
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,570
--That's okay.
--Hm?

262
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,460
Leave him alone.

263
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,000
That idiot's being stubborn.

264
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,210
Search every nook and cranny!

265
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
There's gotta be some evidence somewhere!

266
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,840
Th-This isn't good!

267
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,840
Let's make do with this!

268
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,260
Wanze-san! The train's in a whole lot of trouble!

269
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,770
Shut up! I'm the one who's
in a whole lot of trouble!

270
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,860
Nero-san! The criminals made an escape!

271
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,730
Hm?

272
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,480
How was it over there?

273
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,140
Was there something unusual?

274
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,640
Nothing for now.

275
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,780
I see.

276
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,180
Hm?

277
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,680
Oof.

278
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,380
Ah!

279
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,590
Ahhh! I found them!

280
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,300
Oh, shoot!

281
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,170
Metallic Star!

282
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,600
Who's there?!

283
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,210
He told me everything.

284
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,140
I heard that you guys want
to rescue a mademoiselle.

285
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,130
That alone is reason enough
for me to lend a hand.

286
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,750
I will fight alongside you!

287
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,840
My name is...

288
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,540
...Sogeking!

289
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,290
We had a dream that day

290
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,080
Our belief in ourselves

291
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,130
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

292
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:56,640
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

293
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:06,820
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

294
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:15,410
In the end, we can all surely smile

295
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,420
We'll now start the meeting for
Operation Rescue Robin-chan.

296
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,880
Sanji-kun, we've never met before.
Don't you have any questions?

297
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,180
First, we'll efficiently reduce
the number of enemies in the train.

298
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,390
You know, like my origins
or my killer techniques?

299
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,510
And then, we'll crush the main forces in turns.

300
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,560
Sogeking! "I'll-Do-My-Best" Star!

301
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,850
Hey! Give it a rest already! Just listen to me!

302
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,400
Oh, okay. Sorry.

303
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

304
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,110
"A Mysterious Man Appears?!
His Name Is Sogeking!"

305
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,210
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
