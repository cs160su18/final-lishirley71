2
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,710
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,750
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,260
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,480
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,080
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,340
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,990
What speed!

24
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,700
--He's well on his way to
catching up with Porche-chan!
--Flower Shurikens!

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,870
I'm a wall...

26
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,250
Oh! But he clears the wall with a skillful toss!

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,630
Is it only a matter of time
until he catches Porche-chan?!

28
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,980
He's already back?!

29
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,020
Take this!

30
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,310
--Oh...
--Oh?!

31
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,480
That's it.

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,440
Now do it just like I explained!

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,360
That's it! Stand up, Luffy!

34
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:13,790
"A Seriously Heated Race!
Into the Final Round!"

35
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,880
C'mon! You can do it! Just a little more!

36
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,290
Man, this is great!

37
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,230
This is so moving! Seriously!

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,150
All right! I'm up!

39
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,610
Hang on, Usopp!

40
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,030
Luffy!

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,950
And then...

42
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,330
...like this?!

43
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,750
It's so fast! Awesome!

44
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,840
I won't let you win!

45
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,640
Amazing!

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,900
It's hard to believe Straw Hat Luffy
couldn't even stand up moments ago!

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,810
He's keeping pace with Chiqicheetah,

48
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,650
who's powered up with his
Double Speed Full Dash!

49
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,620
Crap! I never taught him how to turn corners!

50
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,510
Straw Hat Luffy has left the course once again!

51
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,960
He's out of Round #3 as well!

52
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,970
Darn it...!

53
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,640
I knew it! He's hopeless...!

54
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,150
There goes the Speed King, Chiqicheetah!
He's four laps in the lead now!

55
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,450
Long-nose! Grab on! Hurry!

56
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,450
Right! Whoa...!

57
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,450
What's this?! Archaeologist
Nico Robin uses a Long Whip!

58
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,910
Will this help him rally back?!

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,080
Oh, that woman!

60
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,670
Porche-chan! Just leave it to me, ya know?!

61
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,940
There it is! Chiqicheetah's
Triple Speed Rocket Dash!

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,220
Hey! He went off the course just now, dammit!

63
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,910
He was only in the air! Only in the air!

64
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,740
Violent coach Sanji's desperate
complaint is shot down!

65
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,910
I have to do something before it's too late!

66
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,880
Mucha Caramente!

67
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,340
Oh, no!

68
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,800
I wouldn't move if I were you!

69
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,310
The more you struggle,
the tighter it gets, ya know!

70
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,520
It's no use! I'm soft-bodied!
That doesn't hurt me one bit, ya know!

71
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,160
Well done, Jube!

72
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,870
That's one down, ya know!

73
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,610
Damn! They got Robin-chan!

74
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,870
Hey, idiot coach!

75
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,360
We're gonna lose unless we do
something about that Chiqicheetah guy!

76
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,880
Don't need you to tell me that!

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,840
"Chiqi... cheetah"...

78
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,530
Cheetah?

79
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,960
Could it be?!

80
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,420
Old guy!

81
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,340
Old guy with the horse! You here?!

82
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,310
Oh, you mean me?

83
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,290
That Long Kiwi you gave Luffy!
Where'd you get it?!

84
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,760
--What are you talking about?!
--Shut it!

85
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,820
Hurry! Tell me where!

86
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,250
There! They grow on those trees!

87
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,870
Hey, Shrub Head! Run and get us a kiwi branch!

88
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,280
Is that how you ask for stuff?!

89
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,580
It might be the only way to stop him!

90
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,040
Stop him?!

91
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah! So get goin'!

92
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,110
--Wh-What the...?!
--What's he doing?!

93
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,880
--You can ride Shelly!
--Thanks!

94
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,220
Dunno if it'll work or not,
but it's better than nothing!

95
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,150
After four minutes,
Chiqicheetah has a huge 13-lap lead!

96
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,610
Four and a half minutes have passed!
His lead has increased to 15 laps!

97
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,580
Things are looking bleak
for the Straw Hat Dangers!

98
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,040
What's taking that loser so long?!

99
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,420
Is that it?!

100
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,560
Four minutes and fifty seconds have passed!

101
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,290
Ten more seconds and the Foxy Devils
will clinch a shut-out victory!

102
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,850
Not gonna make it...!

103
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,860
Five seconds to go!

104
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,930
Wh-What's happening?!

105
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,240
I-Is that...?!

106
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,300
O-Oh, my! What on earth
happened to Chiqicheetah?!

107
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,170
Chiqicheetah left the course
just before the round ended!

108
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,960
What a conclusion!

109
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,600
The Straw Hat Dangers come from
behind to win the third round!

110
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,960
Oh, no! Chiqicheetah!

111
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,440
What?!

112
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,710
H-Hooray!

113
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,410
--What happened?!
--What's the deal?!

114
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,460
Kiwifruits have catnip-like properties.

115
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:35,510
Just like with catnip, the smell of the
plant itself mesmerizes some cats.

116
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,390
Cheetahs are cats too,
so I figured it was worth a shot.

117
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,820
So that's why he was sniffing Luffy earlier!

118
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,310
I'm guessing so.

119
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,780
Excellent thinking, Cook!

120
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,980
Oh! It was nothing!

121
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,780
Whew, just barely made it...

122
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,780
The Straw Hat Dangers have
scored a point of their own!

123
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,480
But the Foxy Devils still have the advantage!

124
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,700
There's no time to bask in the
afterglow of victory, though!

125
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,750
It's time for Round #4 to begin!

126
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,710
The scorers will be Nico Robin the archaeologist

127
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,170
versus Jube the fishman!

128
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,680
A great match-up, indeed!

129
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,150
Listen up, Luffy! When you reach a curve...

130
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,020
I got it! I'm fine now!

131
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,180
What do you mean "fine"?
You screwed up just a second ago...

132
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,150
Don't you remember, Zoro? You told
me to watch everyone else earlier...

133
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,400
He's definitely going to shoot that beam again.

134
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,510
Yeah. That Idiot-Idiot Beam is bad news.

135
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,080
--Idiot-Idiot Beam...?!
--B-Boss!

136
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,200
Usopp! Hear me out!

137
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,040
What is it?

138
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,300
You're a wicked one, all right!

139
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,050
Good idea, huh?!

140
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,580
Oh! Does the heartless Nami
have a secret plan?!

141
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,280
Her dishonest face is on par
with that of our own boss!

142
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,960
Who're you calling dishonest?!

143
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,020
You.

144
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,540
It's time for Round #4!

145
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,460
Got ya good earlier, huh?

146
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,430
Ready! Go!

147
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,140
Oh, no, you don't!

148
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,350
I'm no Chiqicheetah, but I'm
pretty fast too, ya know!

149
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,860
Twenty seconds are up! Defense, go!

150
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,320
I-Is Luffy gonna be okay?!

151
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,710
--Yes!
--Way to go, Luffy!

152
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,310
Bring it on anytime! I'll give you
another taste of my Mucha Caramente!

153
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,260
No, you won't!

154
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,470
Oh! Is he finally in fighting form?!

155
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,790
Straw Hat Luffy sends Jube flying!

156
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,700
Go, Robin! I'll take care of this guy!

157
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,160
Right!

158
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,430
Huh?! My baton is gone!

159
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,930
So sorry!

160
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,730
Oh! How could you?!

161
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,070
I'd stay down if I were you!

162
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,070
Okay...!

163
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,050
Incredible! The Straw Hat Dangers are on a roll!

164
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,450
They've taken a one-lap lead!

165
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,450
We'll just see about that!

166
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,520
Hamburg! Prepare for a full dash!

167
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,920
Right!

168
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,380
Get ready, Usopp!

169
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,800
Yeah! I dub it "Operation
Laugh and Fall"! Ready?!

170
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,890
Okay!

171
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,110
Lousy Split-Head! Shootin' your
Idiot-Idiot Beam again, huh?!

172
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,970
Split-Head?! Idiot-Idiot Beam?!

173
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,910
He's not like that! He's an
intelligent, handsome man!

174
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,050
Don't listen to her, you stupid fox!

175
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,370
No, I'm serious! I'm head over heels for you!

176
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,440
No one would like you, Crappy Split-Head!

177
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,180
He added "Crappy" to "Split-Head"...!

178
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,090
So handsome!

179
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,170
--Split-Head!
--Handsome!

180
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,340
--Split-Head!
--I'm in love!

181
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,050
All lies!

182
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,400
Split-Head! Split-Head--!

183
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,850
What are you doing, Nami?!
You need to compliment him!

184
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,770
I can't go on... It's making me sick...

185
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,810
Switch places with me...

186
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,570
Why, you... How dare you?!

187
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,570
I can't think of any nice things to say...

188
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,600
--All right! Let's just keep repeating stuff!
--Right!

189
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,530
--You're manly! You're manly!...
--Split-Head! Split-Head!...

190
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,790
He can't fire his Slow-Slow Beam!

191
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,500
Has our boss been KOed by
this ingenious verbal assault?!

192
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,370
Time is nearly up!

193
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,850
--Manly! Manly! Manly!...
--Split-Head! Split-Head!...

194
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,350
--Split-Head!
--Manly!

195
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,020
--Split-Head!
--Split-Head!

196
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,210
Incredible! Just incredible!

197
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,950
The Straw Hat Dangers win
Round #4 by a landslide!

198
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,260
There'll now be a five-minute break
before the final round begins!

199
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,380
I can't believe I fell for that childish trick!

200
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,170
Or that this would drag out to the final round!

201
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,320
We can't lose the next one!

202
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,150
We'll use you-know-what to win for sure!

203
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,580
The plan?!

204
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,260
All right! Let's win this thing!

205
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,210
The final round is about to begin!

206
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,150
Both teams, to the starting line!

207
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,950
Oh! The Foxy Devils' scorer,
Girarin, is all alone!

208
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,870
All the others are off the track!

209
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,690
Could they be planning to
unleash that huge technique?!

210
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,080
Huge technique?

211
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,660
Just gonna be another Idiot Beam, obviously.

212
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,040
Oh, my. How did you know?

213
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,700
Yes. This tactic is all about getting
the Slow-Slow Beam to hit its mark.

214
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,240
But knowing that still won't help ya!

215
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,530
As if! Weren't you paying attention last time?!

216
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,710
We have Operation Laugh and Fall!

217
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,040
Don't worry, Luffy! Just skate like crazy!

218
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,060
Yeah! Leave it to me!

219
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,050
Okay, it's time!

220
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,230
Ready! Go!

221
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,690
What?! Already?!

222
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:59,080
--Manly! Manly! Manly!...
--Split-Head! Split-Head!...

223
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,000
Slow-Slow Beam!

224
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,330
There it is! A barrage of Slow-Slow Beams!

225
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,960
Why isn't Operation Laugh and Fall working?!

226
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,840
Huh? Did you say somethin'?!

227
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,350
Earplugs!

228
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,560
The Straw Hat Dangers have been bested!
That's our boss for you!

229
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,020
C-Crap!

230
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,320
Is it me, or do the Idiot Beams
bounce off that guy?!

231
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,120
Oh! You noticed?

232
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,780
Slow-Slow Beams don't work on Girarin!

233
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,240
Oh, really? Why not?

234
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,710
Oh, I'm afraid that's a secret!

235
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,550
Oh, a secret? That's what I thought!

236
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,970
That's why you're already off the course, huh?

237
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,370
That's right. All your guys are gonna
turn into slowpokes, but not us!

238
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,930
And they can't hide behind us!

239
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,900
So that's their deal! This is bad! Really bad!

240
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,070
Twenty seconds are up! Defenders, go!

241
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,360
Time for you all to slow down!

242
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,820
No!

243
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,950
Nami-san!

244
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,180
Direct hit!

245
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,810
Navigator Nami and Sniper Usopp
have fallen prey to the Slow-Slow Beam!

246
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,920
Luffy! Look out behind you!

247
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,720
They finally got Straw Hat Luffy!

248
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,310
Is victory a near-certainty now?!

249
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,260
That just leaves you!

250
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:55,650
I can't risk it! We'll be
done for if that beam hits me!

251
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,530
Oh! What's this?!

252
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,930
Nico Robin was keeping the
Straw Hat Dangers in the game!

253
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,550
And now... she's given up?

254
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,510
She's exited the course of her own
accord with only one minute left!

255
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,720
The Slow-Slow Beam lasts for 30 seconds...

256
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,500
If Luffy can dodge the next attack,
he'll still have a chance...!

257
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,760
Failure isn't an option!

258
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,480
I have to wait for my chance!

259
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,480
What's going on, Robin-chan?

260
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,950
I can avoid those beams by staying here, right?

261
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,410
Robin-chan...?

262
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,370
Forty seconds remain!
Girarin has an easy, three-lap lead!

263
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,860
Ouch...!

264
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,340
Time for another dose, just to be safe!

265
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,190
Wha...?!

266
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,430
It's been fun, Straw Hat Luffy...

267
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,520
...but this is the end!

268
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,770
Thirty seconds left!

269
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,360
Victory is guaranteed if he can hit
Straw Hat Luffy with another beam!

270
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,200
End of the line!

271
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,130
Crap!

272
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,130
Skate, Luffy! There's no time!

273
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,050
All right!

274
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,510
Twenty seconds left!

275
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,150
Mucha Cara...

276
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,540
Grilled or deep-fried... Which do you prefer?

277
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,820
D-Damn!

278
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,790
D-Damn...!

279
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,640
Ten seconds left!

280
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,010
Straw Hat Luffy is moving at incredible speed!

281
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,550
This could turn into a mad dash for the finish!

282
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,190
Oh! Our boss slowed himself down!

283
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Five seconds left!

284
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,030
Swords that can't cut...

285
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,620
...won't work on me!

286
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,210
The Straw Hat Dangers
come from behind to win!

287
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,950
Yes!

288
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

289
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,710
Chasing after something constant

290
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,340
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

291
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,590
Even when we're exhausted

292
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,760
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

293
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,180
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

294
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,100
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

295
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,900
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

296
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,860
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

297
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,940
Eternally... Eternally...

298
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
Wild fantasies from our childhood

299
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,570
We trace unforgettable memories

300
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,250
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

301
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,040
To this familiar sunny sky

302
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Together we entrust our feelings

303
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,460
We go beyond the changing time

304
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,260
Eternally... Eternally...

305
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,030
--Thank you, Luffy!
--You know we'd never lose!

306
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,930
As a pirate, I refuse this outcome!
I challenge you to extra rounds!

307
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,680
--Are you an idiot?!
--Id--?!

308
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,730
Who'd agree to more of these lame games?!

309
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,810
All right! You're on!

310
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,610
What a surprise.

311
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,930
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,770
"Screaming-Hot Bombardment!
Pirate Dodgeball!"

313
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
