2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,940
--Jango!
-- Y-Yeah?

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll handle the boy.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,540
You take care of Miss Kaya.

27
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,910
As we planned, have her write a will...

28
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,700
...then kill her!

29
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,580
U-Usopp Pirates!

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,090
Protect Kaya!

31
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,060
Luffy!

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,550
Me and Usopp are gonna chase
that hypno-freak! That a problem?!

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,510
Nope! Hurry!

34
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,480
What?!

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,260
T-That's Captain Kuro for ya!

36
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,510
Hurray for Captain Kuro!

37
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,520
Get 'im!

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Captain Kuro!

39
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,510
You're awesome, Captain Kuro!

40
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,410
Don't call me that name!

41
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,440
This plan is so I can be completely
rid of the name "Captain Kuro"!

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,510
I'm tired...

43
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,030
Devising plans everyday for you
men who only care about mayhem...

44
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,180
Being relentlessly attacked by
government dogs and bounty hunters...

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,230
W-What?!

46
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,960
You're "tired"?!

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,720
You're not fit to be a pirate if having
a name on the seas scares you!

48
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,750
My ambition is much greater than yours!

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,290
"Protect Kaya! The Usopp
Pirates' Great Efforts!"

50
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,480
Is that hypnotist still behind us?!

51
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,900
Nope, I don't see him!
Let's lose him for good!

52
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,860
Like he can really catch
us inside this forest!

53
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,660
Don't worry, Kaya-san!
We will keep you safe!

54
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,990
Yeah! In the name of the Usopp Pirates!

55
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,190
Thank you...

56
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,310
Not there...

57
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,890
Where are you, you runts?!

58
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,920
Don't think you can escape me!

59
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,260
I can shave this whole
forest bald, if you'd like!

60
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,580
Whoa!

61
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,640
He seems really mad!

62
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,040
He's not just a hypnotist?!

63
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,760
Where did you run off to?

64
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,800
This way!

65
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,040
Where are you, you runts?!

66
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,500
Hey! East! East! I said east!

67
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,760
Like I know where that is!
Tell me left or right!

68
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,630
--Then turn right!
--That's the opposite way!

69
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,260
Kaya-san!

70
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,210
I'm sorry... You run on ahead...

71
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,230
What are you saying?!
Our mission is to protect you!

72
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,750
Oh, no! She's got a really bad fever!

73
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,650
Eh?! Hang in there, Kaya-san!

74
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,890
A doctor! Get a doctor!

75
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,940
You idiot! This is no time for that!
Someone's trying to kill her!

76
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,860
But it's dangerous for
her to run any more!

77
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,840
But...

78
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,380
Where are you, you runts?!

79
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,410
Thank you...
I'm happy that you helped me...

80
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,460
Just the thought is enough for me...

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,520
Run away, all three of you.

82
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,140
Where did you run off to?

83
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,350
It's no use running! Come on out!

84
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,600
If we leave Kaya-san and run now,
we'll probably survive, right?

85
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,840
Yeah, probably.

86
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,630
Plus our captain always said to run
with your tail between your legs

87
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,070
if you think you're gonna lose...

88
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,640
Damn brats think they can mock me!

89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,050
Our captain is a liar!

90
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,590
Even he went and fought!

91
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,900
He tried so hard to protect us!

92
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,470
I won't let Kaya-san die!

93
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,240
Alright, then! Prepare
yourselves, Usopp Pirates!

94
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,070
Alright!

95
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,400
Let's fight him!

96
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,810
No! You're still just children!

97
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,370
You mustn't die for my sake!

98
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,330
We're not gonna die.
We're gonna fight to live!

99
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,990
As our captain always said.

100
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,950
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

101
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,850
You brats...

102
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,090
T-That guy...

103
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,380
He broke Captain Kuro's "Cat Claw"!

104
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,650
That leaves only five more
of those weird swords!

105
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,900
It's okay! He can still fight plenty!

106
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,910
Yeah! He still has the other claw!

107
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,570
Scratch him up and
kill 'im, Captain Kuro!

108
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,500
Hey! That name is taboo now!

109
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,640
I think his name in this
village is Klaha... something.

110
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
Kla-san, then!

111
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,600
--Kla-san! Get 'im!
--Kla-san! Get 'im!

112
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,940
Be quiet, you!

113
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,240
I'll come exterminate
every one of you later...

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,740
Jango too, of course!

115
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,390
W-Why us?!

116
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,750
Please stop joking around, Captain Kuro!

117
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,610
It's still not too late for us
to attack the village, right?!

118
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,720
And if Captain Jango gets her to
write her will, the plan should work!

119
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,950
You need not worry about this plan;

120
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,020
your corpses will be enough for
me to place the blame on you...

121
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,730
I never intended to let you
leave this village from the start...

122
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,890
I can't have people who
know I exist stay alive...

123
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,750
You can't be serious!

124
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,690
Then you planned to kill
us from the very start?!

125
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,280
That's right...

126
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,180
Since three years ago, when I
was still known as Captain Kuro...

127
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,180
It was all...

128
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,460
...all part of my plan!

129
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,470
Man, you guys're dumb.

130
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,000
You're such an uncool pirate group!

131
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,670
"Uncool"?

132
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,100
Pirate groups are nothing more
than a collection of social outcasts!

133
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,640
Without plans, what
can they possibly do?!

134
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,820
Every last one should just
shut up and follow my plans!

135
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,120
Crew members are loyal
pawns of the captain!

136
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,100
Whether my men live or die is all
up to my orders as their leader!

137
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,270
No matter how powerful the obstacle,

138
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,290
they simply need to stand up
to it and die for my plan...

139
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,840
This is how pirates are!

140
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,060
Don't you talk down to me, traveler boy!

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,730
No matter how many hundreds

142
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,490
or thousands of men follow
you as their captain...

143
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,110
...you'll never be better than Usopp!

144
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
What?!

145
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,080
You're saying I'm inferior to a kid
pretending to be a pirate captain?

146
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,920
That's right!

147
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,480
You're hilarious!

148
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't get cocky just because
you snapped one of my claws!

149
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
How exactly is he better than me?!

150
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,850
Let's hear it!

151
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,820
Character.

152
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,170
What?!

153
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,940
You don't know what a true pirate is!

154
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,280
H-He...

155
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,650
He kept up with the Pussy
Foot Maneuver's speed!

156
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,340
How insulting...

157
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,470
If you want to know about
real pirates that much,

158
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,020
then I'll show you that terror...

159
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,930
The terror of a pirate who's been
face-to-face with death many times!

160
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,940
Hey! That stance! Is he--

161
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,070
He's gonna use that technique?!

162
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,530
But he's only fighting one guy!

163
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,290
But that's definitely it!

164
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,750
He's planning to use the
Out of the Back Attack!

165
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,290
Isn't it bad for us to be
here?! He'll get us, too!

166
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,720
He plans to kill us, too!
He even said so earlier!

167
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,370
Please stop, Captain Kuro!
Anything but that technique!

168
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,240
We'll do anything you want!

169
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,540
Please, Captain Kuro!

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,190
What's the big deal?

171
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,640
He's only wobbling back and forth...

172
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,880
Don't do it!

173
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,550
Captain Kuro!

174
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,790
Please stop, Captain Kuro!

175
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,580
Out of the Back Attack!

176
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,850
What a small haul...

177
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,390
I thought they'd have a
little more treasure than that...

178
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,420
Let's see, is the fight over by now?

179
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,700
Huh? Everyone's stopped...

180
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,460
Is it over?

181
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,330
T-There it is!

182
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,490
Why over there?!

183
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,210
Not again!

184
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,400
Now it's the wall!

185
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,860
Please stop, Captain Kuro!

186
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,760
It's no use! He attacks at random
using his Pussy Foot Maneuver!

187
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,420
Because of his speed, not even
he knows what he's cutting!

188
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,770
So many crew members
have fallen victim to--

189
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,820
Hey!

190
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,780
W-What's happening?!

191
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,240
People are suddenly being cut!

192
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,640
Show yourself, butler...

193
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,490
Who do you take your friends for?!

194
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,070
Luffy...

195
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,600
Found you!

196
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,570
Bastard! You should've let
yourself be cut like a good boy!

197
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,970
Look! Thanks to you, my adorable
men are left alive and in agony.

198
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,760
It would've been better for
them to die in that attack!

199
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,400
Now what? You look like
you have something to say...

200
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,260
Yeah...

201
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,250
I will never be...

202
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,260
...a man like you.

203
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,060
Not "will."

204
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,840
Someone like you can't be like me!

205
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,690
Especially since
you're going to die here,

206
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,780
while you writhe in agony as
I hack you up like raw fish...

207
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,550
I'm going to painstakingly
carve you up as a special treat!

208
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,780
Oh, no, you don't!

209
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,950
Out of the Back Attack!

210
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,430
Come out, you brats!

211
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,600
I know you're hiding there!
Give yourself up!

212
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,950
We surrender!
We'll give you Kaya-san!

213
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,000
Come over here!
We'll take you to her!

214
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,930
Like I'll really fall for that!

215
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,360
I can't trust what a bunch of brats say!

216
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,230
Huh?!

217
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,310
We got him! Now!

218
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,940
Take this! Pepper Attack!

219
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,170
I knew it! They were...
they were lying from the very start!

220
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,590
--Push...
--Push...

221
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,550
--Hyaaah!
--Hyaaah!

222
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,260
Oww! Oww! Oww!

223
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,930
End of the line, hypnotist!

224
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,470
Don't get cocky!

225
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,780
Darn it! We failed!

226
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,530
You made a mockery of me.

227
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,030
But I am a pirate...

228
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,690
--Onion!
--Onion!

229
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,420
You pretend pirates have
interfered a bit too much...

230
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,390
Where are you hiding, Miss?!

231
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,090
I'll start by executing these three.

232
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,970
You can reflect on your foolishness
to meddle in a real pirate fight

233
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,680
in the next life.

234
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,640
There you are.

235
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,390
No!

236
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,150
Run, Kaya-san!

237
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,740
Run!

238
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,970
Hey!

239
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,830
Yeah! That's them!

240
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,450
They're the other way?!

241
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,480
Please stop this!

242
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,790
Leave them alone!

243
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,480
I'll write my will!

244
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,750
N-No!

245
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,570
You'll be killed if you write it, Kaya-san!

246
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,210
I'm sorry...

247
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,660
Fool. Don't try to make a deal with me.

248
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,230
Captain Kuro told me
to get rid of everyone.

249
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,610
You can't be serious!

250
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,620
If you don't do as I say,
then you won't get to kill me!

251
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,000
I won't write my will, either!

252
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,960
H-Hold on! Don't act hasty!

253
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,880
I absolutely must get
you to write that will!

254
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,300
K-Kaya-san!

255
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,010
Alright! I'll let the brats go!

256
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,800
Though they're really
in no condition to run...

257
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,220
Here!

258
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,320
Don't forget to sign your name!

259
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,640
I know...

260
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,830
D-Darn it...

261
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,160
"I leave my entire fortune
to Klahadore, my butler..."

262
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,100
Excellent! This is your will, all right!

263
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,970
That saved me the trouble
of hypnotizing you!

264
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,920
You promise not to kill them, right?

265
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,340
Don't worry.

266
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,560
I may not look like it, but I'm
known for being an honest man.

267
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,810
--Kaya-san!
--Kaya-san!

268
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,530
There they are!

269
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,030
There they are! There they are! Stop!

270
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,520
Ouch, ouch!
I've been cut there, you know!

271
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,810
Over there!

272
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,950
--Alright, I'll be back!
--Hey!

273
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,210
That's far enough, hypno-freak!

274
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,960
He followed me here?!

275
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,190
Looks like I better finish this quickly!

276
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:24,370
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

277
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:31,310
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

278
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:38,030
before someone else could
beat me to it

279
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:52,630
If the world is going to change

280
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:59,640
before I can even attain my dream

281
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,710
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

282
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:20,100
so that my memories won't fade

283
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,240
All finished here! The rest is up to you!

284
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,400
I won't lose to someone who ditches
his name and runs from the sea!

285
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,220
Remember my name for
the rest of your life!

286
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,410
What're you so mad about?

287
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,620
I hate him! He's wrong!

288
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,160
That's how pirates are.

289
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,700
That's not what friends are like!

290
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,140
On the next episode of One Piece!

291
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,730
"Anger Explosion!
Kuro vs. Luffy, How it Ends!"

292
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
