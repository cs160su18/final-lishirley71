2
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,750
So, you guys stay and wait
on the sea for five minutes

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,210
and charge in to the main island in
Rocketman through the main gate.

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,460
We'll go in first and break open the
main gate and the main island front gate

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,670
so that the train can pass through.

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,050
We'd like you guys to go after only CP9,
avoiding unnecessary battles.

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,760
Okay, got it.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,810
Oof!

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,270
What?!

10
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,110
Why the hell is he doing things on his own?!

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,490
That man doesn't have a
clue about the plan at all!

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,900
How dare you, pirate?!

13
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm in a hurry.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,930
More people are coming later, so... See ya!

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,490
Don't let them open it! Defend it at all costs!

16
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,080
Move! You're in our way!

17
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,080
Rush in!

18
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,290
We broke through the first gate, the main gate!

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,350
Hey, Sogeking.

20
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,520
Hey!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,890
Hey, that hurt!

22
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,190
About how to use this takt for chilled air...

23
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,900
Hm? Let me see...

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,900
Do not ask me!

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,740
I wonder... if everyone is okay.

26
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,160
Just sit and wait patiently, Chopper.

27
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,080
It's bad enough our captain has no patience.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:56,440
"Kashii
'Main Island Front Gate'
Gatekeeper, Enies Lobby"

29
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:56,440
"Oimo
'Main Island Front Gate'
Gatekeeper, Enies Lobby"

30
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,350
I didn't get enough sleep.

31
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm gonna get rid of them
quickly and go back to bed.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,440
Me, too.

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,150
G-G-Giants!

34
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,660
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,780
How many friends did you bring?

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,580
There are 10,000 soldiers in Enies Lobby!

37
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,880
Yeah, I'm by myself.

38
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,970
Get out of my way!

39
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,390
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,780
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

41
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,780
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

42
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,700
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

43
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,420
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

44
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,380
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

45
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,640
we will be able to make it through

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,850
Always!

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,600
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,570
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

49
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,660
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

50
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,200
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,500
We can't stop here

52
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Around the world

53
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,710
Start me up!

54
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,380
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

55
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,600
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

56
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,560
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

58
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,320
Brand New World

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,860
Start me up!

60
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,580
"Main Island Front Gate"
"Main Gate"

61
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,170
"Courthouse" "Tower of Law"

62
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,430
"Battle against Giants!
Open the Second Gate!"

63
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,270
We're not gonna let you through this gate!

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,450
If you don't give up and go back,

65
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,950
we're gonna stomp on you!

66
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,300
Don't flinch! Big Bro Franky is
on the other side of that gate!

67
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,070
Show them a fight worthy of
Bro's name, Franky Family!

68
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,280
Don't give in! Open the path for Rocketman!

69
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,750
Break open the doors!

70
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,970
We're not gonna let even
an ant pass through this gate!

71
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,770
--Destroyers!
--Everyone...!

72
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,810
Dammit! How dare you bring down
some of our strongest forces?!

73
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,190
Go!

74
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,870
What the...?!

75
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,450
--Zambai!
--Kiwi! Mozu!

76
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,330
Galley-La!

77
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,330
Sorry that we're late!

78
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,920
It took longer than I thought to switch
Sodom and Gomorrah to land mode!

79
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,340
Zambai! The Destroyers are...

80
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,840
I know.

81
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,760
We have no time to patch them up right now.

82
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,970
In order to get to where Bro is,

83
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,520
we have to open this gate at any cost!

84
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,990
Let's go!

85
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,620
Yeah!

86
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,540
Let's make him lose his balance, Mozu!

87
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,210
Roger, Kiwi!

88
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,170
Hull... Dismantler Slash!

89
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,100
Rope Action...

90
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,270
...Timber Hitch Tug!

91
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,060
Ow...! Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

92
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,700
Kashii!

93
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,870
Tilestone!

94
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,500
Yeah!

95
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,680
Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

96
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,090
Trunnel Lock!

97
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,760
Work completed!

98
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,070
You bastards...!

99
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm gonna crush you!

100
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,290
Ahhh! Kashii!

101
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,710
All right!

102
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,840
How dare you...?!

103
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,140
Guys! Let's take the other one down!

104
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,310
Yeah!

105
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,150
So what's the current status?

106
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,490
Sir. Kashii and Oimo should be
dealing with them right now

107
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,860
in front of the main island front gate.

108
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,620
So I don't think there'll be any issues.

109
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,990
I see. So did you capture Straw Hat,
the one who infiltrated the main island?

110
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,580
Well... Er...

111
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,960
...this is just an estimate,
but it's about four hundred...

112
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,130
Four hundred? What're you talking about?

113
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,090
Our casualties, sir!

114
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,270
Huh?! Our casualties?!

115
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,810
Are you saying that four hundred
guards have been taken out?!

116
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,850
It looks like there are a hundred more down...

117
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,820
Well, I'm sorry. I need to correct the number.

118
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,190
Obviously! Our guards
are not trash or anything.

119
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,360
I'll be damned if that
many have been taken out!

120
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,740
If there are casualties,
make sure you get the details right!

121
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,500
Er... well then, here is the report.

122
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,170
The current casualties we
have here are five... Gahh!

123
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,680
Five are down?! So it was
actually just five guards?!

124
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,060
Geez... You can't even make a report properly?

125
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,140
Five... hundred guards...

126
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,610
Looks like Straw Hat Luffy isn't fighting;
he's just running around the island.

127
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,400
Well, that's just natural. No one is
stupid enough to fight that many guards.

128
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,910
It's just a matter of time before he's captured.

129
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,080
Welcome back, sirs and madam.

130
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,460
Chief, Mr. Lucci and the others are here.

131
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,880
So they're back?

132
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,130
Show them in here.

133
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,250
It's been a while, Chief.

134
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,710
Yeah...

135
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,470
Cutty Flam, the criminal who is responsible

136
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,560
for assaulting Government officials
in Water Seven eight years ago...

137
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,230
Nico Robin, the criminal who
was involved in the incident

138
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,610
where Navy battleships were
attacked in Ohara in the West Blue...

139
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,730
We've completed the escort
of these two without a hitch.

140
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,530
They're both behind those doors.

141
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,160
Welcome back! Lucci, Kaku, Blueno, and Kalifa!

142
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,450
That's sexual harassment.

143
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,370
Just calling your name is?!

144
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,250
Long time no see, Lucci.

145
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,170
It appears that your audacity
has increased considerably.

146
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,550
It appears that your stupidity has as well, Jabra.

147
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,010
What'd you say?

148
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Stop it, both of you. We just got back.

149
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,400
Yoyoi! He's right. Stop it, you two.

150
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,410
We have been reunited after five years!

151
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,210
Chapapa...

152
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,710
Chapa...

153
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,130
Cha... pa...

154
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,180
Ow...

155
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,720
I thought you'd get on it right away, Fukurou.

156
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,190
Six Powers Skill, Competition!

157
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,820
Suppose an armed guard's
strength is Power Level 10.

158
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,650
"Power Level 10"

159
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,650
Your power levels are...

160
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,490
I'm gonna reveal them.
I'm gonna reveal your strength.

161
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,120
First, Kalifa. She is Power Level 630.

162
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,370
Blueno is Power Level 820.

163
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,580
Kaku is Power Level 2,200.

164
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,880
Lucci is...

165
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,750
...Power Level 4,000!

166
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,920
4,000?! Hey, did you measure it properly?!

167
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,220
I've never heard of such a high Power Level!

168
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,140
That was accurate! They've all
gotten stronger! Chapapa!

169
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,150
Since I measured Jabra and
Kumadori's too, I know who's stronger!

170
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,110
Hey! Objection, Fukurou!

171
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,280
Setting Lucci aside, what's the deal
with me being weaker than even Kaku?!

172
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,780
Chapapa!

173
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,500
Kaku has gotten stronger, too!

174
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,250
Hey, don't be so sure of yourself, Kaku!

175
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,460
"Competition" is a technique that just
measures one's martial arts ability.

176
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,300
In real battles, my Devil Fruit
powers are added to my abilities.

177
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,130
Just don't forget that you can't defeat me.

178
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,850
Think whatever you like. I'm not
interested in things like that.

179
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,940
That's right. Don't listen to a stray dog.

180
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,360
A stray dog, Lucci?! You damn goblin cat!

181
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,410
Hey, stop it, both of you!

182
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,000
At any rate, Jabra is lashing
out at us quite a bit, isn't he?

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,460
All the guards on the island

184
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,970
are talking about Jabra getting rejected
by the waitress Gatherine yesterday.

185
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,260
Oh, that's why.

186
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,350
H-Hey, hold on a sec! Why does
everyone know about that?!

187
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,480
I told the guards on the
main island about it. Chapapa!

188
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,350
So you're the one?!

189
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,310
"Gatherine"

190
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,150
Geez...

191
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,570
This is all because you started
right in on that stupid ranking stuff.

192
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,110
Having mastered the Six Powers,

193
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,330
you all have far surpassed average people.

194
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,540
Power Level 500 would be enough for
you to be called superhuman, right?

195
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,630
Chief is Power Level 9,
less than one guard. Chapapa.

196
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,590
Don't say that! It's okay because
I'm your Commander in Chief!

197
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,670
Besides, I have a highly valued sword, right?!

198
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,640
I've always known that you're weak, Chief.

199
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,850
H-H-Hey, you shouldn't be so blunt, Kalifa.

200
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,890
That's sexual harassment.

201
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,270
What?! Because I responded to your comment?!

202
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,400
Chief...

203
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,730
Wh... What is it?

204
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,900
That's sexual harassment!

205
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
You mean my existence?!

206
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,910
Yoyoi! Kalifa! How rude of you!

207
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:07,420
Chief! I will... I will take
responsibility by committing hara-kiri!

208
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,250
Hara-kiri! Iron Body!

209
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,970
How regrettable...! I can't die.

210
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,260
I said just die already, you jerk!

211
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:24,020
Could it be that it was you, Mom,
up in heaven, who made me stay alive?!

212
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,730
Is that right?

213
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,190
I see... So your mother was...

214
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,650
Jabra, so you understand how I feel?

215
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,360
Yeah, especially since I got rejected recently,

216
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,250
I understand well how someone
who lost their loved one feels.

217
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,290
Mom!

218
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,710
Gatherine! Am I not good enough for you?!

219
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,550
Mom!

220
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,630
Chief.

221
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,720
What? Wh-What is it?

222
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,470
Looks like the short play is... over.

223
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,480
O-Oh, okay.

224
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,740
Anyway, you've done a great
job over the past five years.

225
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,860
To think that you caught not only Nico Robin,

226
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,580
but you were even able to capture
that annoying Cutty Flam...

227
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,830
Well done!

228
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,710
Once the good news gets out,
the entire world will praise your efforts.

229
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,680
Can you guys tell how proud I am
as your Commander in Chief?

230
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,310
Oh, that's right... This isn't really a
reward for your efforts or anything,

231
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,430
but I do have something I wanna give you.

232
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,900
Well, I'll do that later.

233
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,270
So, in any case, let me meet...

234
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,030
...the "hope" of the entire world!

235
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,380
Now, guys! It's time!

236
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,800
Let's go, shall we?

237
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,180
They should've opened those two gates by now.

238
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,640
Charge ahead! Charge ahead!

239
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,730
Samurai-man! Take care of the iron fence!

240
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,350
Leave it to me.

241
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,610
Ouch!

242
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,030
Hurry up! We don't have much time left!
Hurry up and open the gate!

243
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,450
Don't flinch! Go!

244
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,170
Where am I?!

245
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,420
This street is hard to walk on!

246
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,930
Whoa! Ow!

247
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Just wait, you darn Robin!

248
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,150
Don't think that you can leave
the Straw Hats so easily!

249
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,650
He came out!

250
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,650
Gum-Gum...

251
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,360
Capture him!

252
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,570
...Yo-Yo!

253
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,550
The Commander in Chief wants
to see you. Both of you, go inside.

254
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,180
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

255
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

256
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,220
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

257
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,230
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

258
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,520
We'll become No. 1

259
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

260
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,570
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

261
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,740
an era created by risking everything

262
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,860
We always try our best, let's go!

263
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,870
If we want to achieve glory,

264
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,280
now is the time--don't be afraid

265
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

266
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,170
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

267
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,130
We can take off with unknown powers

268
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,380
We don't fear, and we don't waver

269
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,180
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

270
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

271
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

272
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,350
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

273
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,360
Charge ahead

274
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,270
Let's start running towards tomorrow

275
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,240
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

276
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,250
Are you guys all ready?!
We're gonna charge into Enies Lobby!

277
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,580
We're changing our plan.
They closed the main gate.

278
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,080
What?! What're we gonna do?!

279
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,090
Unless we do something,
we're gonna crash into the gate!

280
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,590
Hey, do something!

281
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,510
No need to worry. There's a way.

282
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,920
--That's our Zoro!
--Just leave it to... luck.

283
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,470
So it's up to luck?!

284
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,840
On the next episode of One Piece!

285
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,180
"Find A Way Out! Rocketman Takes Flight!"

286
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,770
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
