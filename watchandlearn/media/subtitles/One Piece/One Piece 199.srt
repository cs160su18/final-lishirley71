00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesometreasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be Kingof
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyonedreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seenthrough
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destinyis
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieveyour
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

17
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,310
The Straw Hat Pirates have fallen rightinto
the middle of the fortress Navarone.

18
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,850
Zoro was captured.

19
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,680
In addition, Luffy and theothers
infiltrated the base,

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,190
and an impending crisis
drewnearer to them each minute.

21
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,580
"The Navy's Dragnet Closes
In!The Second Member Captured!"

22
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,560
Navy Command Branch 8...

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,820
That's the official name of Navarone.

24
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,490
People also call it the Navy'sstrongest,
an impregnable fortress.

25
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,260
Its headquarters should bein
that island in the center.

26
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,870
But that's about all we know.

27
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,510
We don't have to know things like that.

28
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,210
You want to investigate a fortress now?

29
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,440
Aren't ancient ruins enough for you, Robin?

30
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,240
Of course! We're in the enemy's midst.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,870
Even so, we don't have the
luxuryof looking around forever!

32
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,920
What I wanna know is whetherthe
Going Merry is okay or not.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,140
Where the heck did you go, Merry?!

34
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,420
It's probably reasonable to thinkthat
it was seized by the Navy.

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,090
Geez...! How can you saysuch
a thing so calmly?!

36
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,090
Even if we find the ship, how
arewe going to get out of here?

37
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,500
Are you saying that the
Navywill show us the way out?

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,520
W-Well...

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,620
That's why we should
thoroughlyinvestigate first. Right?

40
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,680
I wouldn't be a pirate if
Iwere scared of the Navy!!

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,110
I can't take this anymore. I'll leavethe
thorough investigation to you.

42
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,390
My leg!

43
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,200
Robin! What the hell are you...?

44
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,850
Found them?!

45
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,660
No, sir!

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,150
Some of the Straw Hats'rehiding
around here for sure!

47
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,400
Leave no stone unturned!

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,130
Yes, sir!

49
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,690
There's no way they can escape wheneven
that Roronoa Zoro was captured.

50
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,360
Z-Zoro was?!

51
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,810
Are you all right, Long-nose?

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,530
D-Did you hear that?

53
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,570
This means they now know that it'sthe
Straw Hat Pirates, not a ghost ship.

54
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,210
Our enemy's in a frenzy. Why don't youworry
about yourself instead of the ship?

55
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,860
I don't care! Sorry, but that shipis
more important than my own life!

56
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,990
I'm going! I've decided! So
don'tget in my way anymore! Later!

57
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,600
He's impossible...

58
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,980
I've come all the way in
astorm to such a remote base,

59
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,470
and they send no oneto escort me?! How rude!

60
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,690
Hm? Hey, you over there!

61
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,350
Yes, sir!

62
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm supposed to meet
thecommander of this base.

63
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,170
Inform them to send someoneto
escort me immediately!

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,510
"Justice"

65
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,510
Yes, sir! Before that, please tell me
whatbusiness brought you to our fortress.

66
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,880
I don't have to explain it to a mere private!

67
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,560
Excuse me, but may I
haveyour division and rank?

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm saying I don't need to explain it to you!

69
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Contact your headquarters immediately!

70
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,980
Even if I did, I don't
think it'd do any good.

71
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,350
What do you mean by that?!

72
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,890
Since Commander Jonathan is eatingright
now, I think he's in the dining hall.

73
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,320
Then all you have to do is go tothe
dining hall to talk to him, right?!

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,910
Um... don't you know the motto of Branch 8?

75
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,450
Motto, you say?

76
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,240
One! Wash your hands before eating!

77
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,780
Two! Never leave food on your plate!

78
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,500
Three! Never mention work while eating!

79
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,730
Four! After eating, make sure to brush...

80
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,310
That's enough! So to
thecommander at this base,

81
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,870
eating is more important than
aVIP sent by Navy Headquarters...

82
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,300
Is that what you're saying?

83
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,230
Yes, sir! That's correct!

84
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,340
All right, I get it. I'll go
toyour headquarters on my own.

85
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,420
Before I go, I'll give you a piece of advice.

86
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,990
Find another job while you can.

87
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Huh?

88
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,680
The hedgehog that has now becomeuseless
in this area of sea...

89
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,880
The odd commander who stays inside,never
setting even a foot outside of it...

90
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,340
The Navy doesn't need
either of them at all now.

91
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,810
I'll probably report them
toHeadquarters at some point.

92
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,550
Hmph! That darn badger! He'll nolonger
be a commander in a few weeks.

93
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,380
Go ahead and enjoy the fewNavarone
meals that you have left.

94
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,940
Guess it was just my imagination.

95
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,490
Navy Headquarters Inspection Division...

96
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,700
What a good person to bump into.

97
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,250
Whoa! Yum!

98
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,130
The new cook is pretty good!

99
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,250
It's just like what those guys whoate
first thing in the morning said!

100
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,900
Everyone! The next 100 soldiers're waiting.

101
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,210
Hurry up and finish eating!

102
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,390
Aye aye, sir!

103
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,100
Here you go.

104
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,110
Hey, Jessica...

105
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,610
This is your usual dish, right?

106
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,490
Any problem, Commander?

107
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,940
Well, my men are carrying on
aboutthe incredibly delicious food

108
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,650
prepared by the cooks from Marie Jois.

109
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,130
So I came here looking forward to it.

110
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,740
You don't like it? When I, the
executivechief chef, cooked it for you myself?

111
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,080
You can't continue to eat the same
kindof food as the younger ones, right?

112
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,040
It's a healthy dish filled
withlots of love. Bon appetit!

113
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,140
But it has lots of vegetables as well...I
don't like broccoli and carrots.

114
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,060
Branch 8's Motto 2!

115
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,790
Ah, um... A-All right... Here!

116
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,280
See? I'm eating it.

117
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,660
Whoa! This is yummy! This one's yummy, too!

118
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,760
Guys! Keep up the good work!

119
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,340
What's that newbie doing?!He's
been sampling food all this time!

120
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,780
Don't worry about him. He only does tasting.

121
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,070
No matter how I look at him,he
doesn't look like a cook

122
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,090
who was in charge of thekitchen
at Navy Headquarters.

123
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,980
In contrast, look at you!
You're very skilled!

124
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,590
You're quite popular among the soldiers, too.

125
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,580
Thanks. I'll write downmy
recipes for you, then.

126
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,360
Prepare food for table 8! Please hurry up!

127
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,880
Aye aye... sir!!

128
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,560
For a beautiful lady, I'd go
throughhell and high water! There!

129
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,260
Wh-Whoa!

130
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,790
Oh! That looks yummy! Okay!I'll
take it to the table for you.

131
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,900
Hold it! If you touch that food,you
won't be eating meals. Got that?!

132
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,440
Aye aye, sir!

133
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
I wonder if he really gets it...

134
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,010
In any case, the guy at
table 8 sure is lucky.

135
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,750
She may not look it, but
shecherishes her husband, so...

136
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh? Jessica-san has a husband?

137
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,950
If you have time for
chit-chatting, get to work!

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,040
Who the heck is this"luckiest
guy in Navarone"?!

139
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,910
It's the Commander of this place, Branch 8.

140
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,090
What?! The Commander, you say?!

141
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,140
Crap! Luffy...!

142
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,630
Here you go!

143
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,930
Thanks. You can go now.

144
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,130
Aye, aye, sir!

145
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,630
This tastes just like theysaid
it did. It's amazing!

146
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,050
This dish lives up to my expectations!

147
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,830
Yeah, you're right!

148
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,330
Let me have some, you cheapskate!

149
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,070
You certainly live up to my expectations!

150
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,710
Oops! Dammit! Looks like I was late!

151
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,530
Welcome, Straw Hat Luffy.

152
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,590
I'm Jonathan, the Commanderof
Navarone, Branch G8.

153
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,620
Straw Hat, I don't wannaget
violent in the dining hall.

154
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,910
But could you answer me one question?

155
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,250
If I answer, can I eat half of that stuff?

156
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,760
Hm? Not just half, you can eat it all.

157
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,840
Really? Then I'll take it.Sorry
that I called you a cheapskate.

158
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,840
Idiot! Hurry up and get out!

159
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,230
No matter how hard I think,I
can't figure out your purpose.

160
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,640
Right. It is said that Captain Smokeris
the one who defeated Crocodile.

161
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,780
It's not as if you gained reputationin
Alabasta, or even money.

162
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,590
What would someone like that want from us?

163
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,940
What did you come to this fortress base for?

164
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,890
What for? Well, when we fell fromthe
sky, we happened to land here.

165
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,530
Hm?

166
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,150
The Grand Line really
is an interesting place.

167
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,370
I've come to like this fortressquite
a bit as well, you know!

168
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,870
You have good food here.I
guess I'm just lucky.

169
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,450
Listen, Straw Hat. Even if you'vegot
the power of a Devil Fruit,

170
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,090
it's impossible to escape Navaronewithout
some sort of miracle.

171
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,960
I'll leave when I want to.

172
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,470
Even after you hear thatRoronoa
Zoro was captured?

173
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,400
Zoro?

174
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,760
That idiot...!

175
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,440
Fortress guy, where's Zoro?

176
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,800
And if I tell you?

177
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,700
What else? I'm gonnago rescue him right away!

178
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,450
You don't have to be so hasty.We'll
take you to the same place soon.

179
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,450
There's no point stayinghere
any longer! Let's go!

180
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,460
Ahh!

181
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,320
Jessica-san...

182
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,450
Little did I know you were Straw Hats!

183
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,130
Your skills are too good for a pirate.

184
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,390
Give it up! Cooks in Navarone
aretougher than your average marine!

185
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,540
Hmph! I come from a
placewith many such cooks!

186
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,900
That said, I can't attack Jessica-san...

187
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,560
Now what should we do?

188
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm starving!

189
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,290
Give us food!

190
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,640
Give us the new cook's
famousridiculously tasty food!

191
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,990
Bring it already!

192
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,820
Wait! We're in the middle of something!

193
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,420
Now! Let's go!

194
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,340
Straw Hat!

195
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,040
See ya, fortress guy!

196
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,860
Our enemy is the Straw Hat Pirates!

197
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,440
Be ready to engage in battle at any time!

198
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,960
To uphold the honor of Navarone,we
must capture them without fail!

199
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,030
Yeah!

200
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,140
Yipes! Those marines're too fired up!

201
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,940
It's really dangerous to keep playinghide
and seek in our enemy's midst!

202
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,160
I'd better do something
aboutmy appearance, at least.

203
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,920
Hm? Yeah... Hm... All right!

204
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,670
Transformation complete!Now
I should be able to openly...

205
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,170
Hold it!

206
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,750
Ahh!

207
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,440
If you're a Navarone marine,you
should dress neatly.

208
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,760
Huh?

209
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,760
This is why I say new recruits are trouble.

210
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,820
Yes, sir! I'll be careful, sir!

211
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,240
Um, by the way, I'd liketo
ask you something, sir.

212
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,640
Do you know how to get to the
dockwhere the Straw Hats' ship is?

213
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,110
It'll be six blocks down from over there.

214
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,110
Thank you very much... sir!

215
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,320
Hey! But the dock is...

216
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,440
That was all I needed to know, sir!

217
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,070
M-Merry! You're okay! Thank God!

218
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,800
A carvel-built caravel that uses a
lateensail with a stern rudder in the center...

219
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,430
The model's a bit old,but
it's really a good ship.

220
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,790
Huh?! Who are you?!

221
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,780
If you don't know me,then
you must be a newbie.

222
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,760
Y-Yeah, sort of...

223
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,590
This ship must've hadquite
a few wild journeys.

224
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,670
Though it's covered with patches,the
repairs were done appropriately.

225
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,170
It's a happy ship filled with lots of love.

226
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,990
You can tell that much?!

227
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,180
It doesn't matter if it's
aNavy ship or a pirate ship.

228
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,620
I can tell for the most
part at the first glance.

229
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,890
That's quite a compliment! Thanks!

230
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,150
Idiot! I'm not praising you!

231
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,550
Well, don't get so upset! I like you!

232
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,380
You sure are perky for a newbie.

233
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,300
You haven't changed, putting pirate
shipsin the same league as navy ships...

234
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,500
Hm?

235
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,850
Lt. Commander Drake, you need to waitat
least a week to have the ship repaired.

236
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,230
It seems that marines these days

237
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,570
are under the mistaken impressionthat
damaging ships is their job.

238
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,200
Thanks to that, docks are kept very busy.

239
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,050
Quietly...

240
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,670
Don't worry. I didn't come here tobother
our veteran maintenance soldier.

241
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,610
Quietly...

242
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,460
Quietly...

243
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,460
I came for the other guy. Hey, you!

244
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,280
Y-Yes, sir!

245
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,750
Which unit are you with?!

246
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,090
Ugh! Wh-Wh-Which unit...?

247
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,870
You can't even tell me
which unit you're with?!

248
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,560
Um, let me see... I think it's Unit 18, sir.

249
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,030
Unit 18 is a sniper unit, isn't it?

250
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,290
Don't you know that this dock is
off-limitsexcept for the maintenance soldiers?

251
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,750
Um... I'd forgotten that, sir! I'm goingback
to the sniper unit right away, sir!

252
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,780
There's no need for that!

253
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,200
No need?!

254
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,460
Take him!

255
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,360
Yes, sir!

256
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,040
What did I do?!

257
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,040
It was reported to me that
asuspicious new recruit was seen.

258
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,270
By the way, Unit 18 isn't asniper
unit, it's a supply unit.

259
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,040
Ah, my bad! That's right! It's a supply unit!

260
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,440
Stop it, you idiots!Where
do you think you are?!

261
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,510
To us, the maintenance
soldiers,this is a sanctuary!

262
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,190
If you shed even one drop of
blood,you won't get away with it!

263
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,610
Pull back your swords.Take
him to headquarters.

264
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,520
Yes, sir!

265
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,850
Hmm, so this is the man...

266
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,340
Commander, he insists that he's a marine,

267
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,110
but the circumstantial evidence
clearlyindicates that he's one of the Straw Hats.

268
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,670
You!

269
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,390
Yes, sir!

270
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,560
What's your name?

271
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,410
What's your name?

272
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,420
It's a secret.

273
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,530
Which unit are you with?

274
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,800
It's a secret.

275
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,910
Why did you take the trouble to goto
the dock where the pirate ship is?

276
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,190
It's a secret.

277
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,550
Secret, huh?

278
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,240
Yes...

279
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,220
Let's imprison him right
awayand put the screws to him!

280
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,720
Now, hold on, Lt. Commander.

281
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,600
Come to think of it, I hear that a
specialinspector from Navy Headquarters

282
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,900
was on board the Stan Mareythat
arrived this morning.

283
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,160
Yes?

284
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,800
A special inspector?

285
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
C-Commander...!

286
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,330
It's natural that an inspector would
hidehis name and division to investigate.

287
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,040
Th-That's ridiculous!An idiot
like him wouldn't be...

288
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,880
I'm surprised that you figured it out.

289
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,670
That's what you'd expect fromthe
Commander. You're right.

290
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,320
I'm a special inspector fromNavy
Headquarters, Captain Usopp!

291
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,220
Is there any illegal activity in Branch 8?!

292
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,920
Are military laws and regulationsbeing
properly followed?!

293
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,800
Are the marines full of enthusiasm?!

294
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,900
So, I disguised myself as a
mereprivate to get the inside scoop.

295
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,360
That's the story!

296
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,820
We apologize, Captain!

297
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,450
Don't be ridiculous!

298
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,660
A special inspector has higherauthority
than a branch commander!

299
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,740
There's no way an idiot
like you could be one!!

300
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,890
Idiot? Idiot?!

301
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,870
What're you saying, Drake whoever,when
you're a mere Lt. Commander?!

302
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,430
What?!

303
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,340
I can have you court-martialed forinsulting
a senior officer, you know...

304
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,170
But...!

305
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,520
Do you wanna experiencethe Navy prison? Huh?

306
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,090
I'm sorry, Captain. I was thinkingabout
sending someone to greet you,

307
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,480
but I got delayed. Please forgive me.

308
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,100
Well, so long as you understand...!

309
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,920
Commander! Special inspector Major Shepherd

310
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,770

312
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,460
The real one showed up?!

313
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,510
See, I was right!!

314
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,530
You son of a bitch! Acting so impertinent!

315
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,510
Ahh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

316
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,690
What's the matter?! What happenedto
the spunk you had earlier?! Huh?!

317
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,070
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,950
What was that about the Navy prison?! Huh?!

319
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,950
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,080
What?! Are you apologizing?! I can't hear it!

321
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

322
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,680
Do you think such a ridiculousspecial
inspector exists?!

323
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,830
I'm really sorry. I'm sorr...

324
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,080
Hm?

325
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,510
Nice to meet you, Commander Jonathan.

326
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,940
You'd better be prepared! Huh?You
stopped apologizing?! Huh?!

327
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,790
R-Robin!

328
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,130
What is it?! Huh?! Where'sthe
spunk you had earlier?!

329
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,380
Oh, I get it! She's disguising herself, too!

330
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,350
What was that about the Navyprison?!
Huh?! Say that again!

331
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,350
All right, then...!

332
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,580
Hey, Major! I didn't knowyou
were in Navarone as well!

333
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,200
H-Hey! It's me! Captain Usopp,also
from the Inspection Division!

334
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
Did you forget me since
you'vebeen traveling so much?!

335
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,020
Major Shepherd, do you know the Captain?

336
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,260
No, I don't know him.

337
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,630
Ahhhhhh!!

338
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,740
See?!

339
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,140
H-Hey! It's me! It's me! Hey!

340
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,360
Hey!!

341
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,740
Imprison him!

342
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,710
Now I'll start investigating Navarone, okay?

343
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,260
Please be my guest!We welcome
you, Major Shepherd.

344
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,290
Thank you very much.

345
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,050
That darn Robin! Does she have
agrudge against me or something?!

346
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,660
That's a betrayal!

347
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,910
You agree, don't you, Zoro?!

348
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,250
Dammit! If Robin had onlygone
along with what I said,

349
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,980
I would've taken Merry back by now!

350
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,570
You should thank Robin.

351
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,920
Why should I?! Why should I?!

352
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,110
You've got me with you.

353
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,870
O-Oh... I see... She thought thatit'd
be safer for me to be with you...

354
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,560
Robin was concerned about me...

355
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,040
But...

356
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,470
...is this place... safe...?

357
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,020
It might've been better if Ididn't
check into it, because...

358
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,800
...that way I would've
stillhad hope for the escape.

359
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,630
To think that there's
only one escape route...

360
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,630
Zoro!!

361
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,040
Where are you, Zoro?! Zoro!!

362
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,780
Shut up! Be quiet!

363
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,220
Oh?!

364
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,590
Hey, this way!

365
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,250
In addition to Zoro, we've also captureda
crew member with a long nose!

366
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,270
Straw Hat and the other members
aredefinitely close by as well! Find them!

367
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,340
Yes, sir!

368
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,250
Hey, what should we do now, Captain?

369
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,110
Straw Hat and a very skilled cook...

370
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,920
A swordsman and a man with a long nose...

371
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,880
A doctor and nurse we've never seen before...

372
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,590
And one more...

373
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,570
...who calls herself Major Shepherd...

374
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,510
That makes seven people...Now it makes sense.

375
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,120
We've already capturedthe
ship and two of them.

376
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,740
The rest of the Straw
Hats are within my hands.

377
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,100
So, what will you do now, Monkey D. Luffy?

378
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,360
I'll just sit back and see what you can do...

379
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

380
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

381
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

382
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

383
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

384
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

385
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

386
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,790
Luffy, we're right here!!

387
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,280
Luffy, don't come!! No,
Ichanged my mind! Come get us!

388
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,030
Hey, Zoro! What should I say?!

389
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,280
How should I know?! Tell them
tocome if they want or something.

390
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,170
Well, that's...

391
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,550
Hang in there! I'll rescue
you right a... waay...

392
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,460
What the..?! Oh, I see! This
isthe Sea Prism Stone's doing!

393
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,280
Dammit! This is a trap!

394
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

395
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,640
"Daring Luffy and Sanji!Their
Great Rescue Operation!"

396
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,740
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
