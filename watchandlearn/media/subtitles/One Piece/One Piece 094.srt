00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,750
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,430
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,550
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,180
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,280
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,620
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,580
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,170
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:21,100
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,430
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,310
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:39,490
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,670
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,420
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,970
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:13,970
"Yuba"              "Nanohana"   "Katorea"

22
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,580
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,290
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,010
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,180
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,430
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,580
Having returned to the
Alabasta Kingdom at long last,

28
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,910
Princess Vivi and Luffy's party
landed at the port town of Nanohana.

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,420
While hiding from
Baroque Works' assassins,

30
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,410
the group prepares for a trek across
the desert to stop the rebel army.

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,200
However, Luffy had rushed
ahead of everyone else

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,540
and found himself
lost outside of town.

33
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,070
"The Heroes' Reunion!
His Name is Fire Fist Ace!"

34
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,070
Oh, youngster!
I haven't seen you before!

35
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,200
Is this your first time in Alabasta?

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,860
Whadya say? Check out
this solid-gold apple!

37
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,320
Hold on!

38
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,660
Don't tell anyone,

39
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,960
but this is an incredible treasure
I found in some ancient ruins!

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,990
It's said one bite of this magic gold
apple will let you live 1000 years!

41
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,090
Sorry. I'm not interested
in living a thousand years.

42
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,760
I just need to live today.

43
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,270
--A solid-gold apple?!
--1000 years of life?!

44
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,900
For real?! For real?! You found
it in some ancient ruins?!

45
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,150
Yep, sure did! It's a legendary
artifact of an ancient civilization!

46
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,930
One bite and we can live 1000 years?!

47
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,660
Yep! It's the truth! I give you my word!

48
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,000
Awesome!

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,330
I see you have very sharp eyes!

50
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,240
In that case, I'll part with it for
the one-time price of 1000 Berries!

51
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,940
1000 Berries?! You got yourself a deal!

52
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,420
Honestly, now! What are you thinking?!

53
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,790
I wouldn't take him seriously if I were you.

54
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,930
Hey! Let go!

55
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,100
I was just about to live 1000
years for only 1000 Berries!

56
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,350
Quit wasting time and look for Luffy!

57
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,360
We're done shopping,
so we leave for the next town

58
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,220
the minute we find him!

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,840
Where did Luffy run off to, anyway?

60
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,200
Shut up, you two!

61
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,040
He's...

62
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,250
Just a quick question.
Have you seen this guy?

63
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:17,700
Huh?

64
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,620
Monkey D. Luffy?

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,080
He might be here in town. I've been
looking for him for a while now.

66
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,790
Hmm. Never seen him.

67
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,270
Oh, but if you're looking for someone,
ask at the restaurant up ahead.

68
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,690
The owner there knows a lot of people.

69
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,770
Much appreciated.

70
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,410
The restaurant, huh? I was
just feeling hungry, anyways.

71
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,450
Who's that? He looks incredibly strong.

72
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,530
Why's he looking for Luffy?

73
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,930
Maybe he's a bounty hunter?

74
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,890
No. He's not.

75
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,110
That mark...

76
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,230
As a former pirate-hunter,
there's no way I wouldn't recognize it.

77
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,910
No... It couldn't be!

78
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,600
It's wrong!

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,150
Selling a sword like this for 200,000
Berries is as good as swindling!

80
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,590
Do you even have a permit?!

81
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
It is her!

82
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,340
I didn't realize you were
Roronoa Zoro, and a pirate.

83
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,240
You... You lied to me!

84
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,280
A rogue like you can't be
allowed to own a renowned sword!

85
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,980
I'll collect your sword,
the legendary Wado Ichimonji!

86
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,360
What is that woman doing here?!

87
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,780
Never try this again!
Do you understand?!

88
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,430
What're you doing, Zoro?

89
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,500
Why're you hiding?

90
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,460
That woman spells nothing
but trouble! Dammit!

91
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,930
Hey. Tashigi.

92
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,560
Captain Smoker!

93
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,340
Small fry pirates.

94
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,120
They thought they could act
like big-shots around me,

95
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,860
so I took care of 'em.

96
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,040
Even in such a distant land, your
distaste for pirates is unfaltering!

97
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,420
If you got time for pointless chit-chat,
have the royal army take 'em!

98
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,580
Y-Yes, sir!

99
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,300
There doesn't seem to be any word yet

100
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,040
of Straw Hat Luffy having
come to this country.

101
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,000
But don't let your guard down.
They will show up. I'm sure of it.

102
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,860
Smoker? That's the Navy
captain from Loguetown!

103
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,780
Are you saying he followed us
all the way here from Loguetown?!

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,230
It would seem so.

105
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,500
And then there's that man...
Things could get ugly quick.

106
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,490
Where is that idiot?!

107
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,690
I'm hungry...

108
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,950
Oh! Thanks for this lunch, old guy!

109
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,550
That wasn't enough at all one bit...

110
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,400
Where's the town?!

111
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,190
Where in the world is the food place?!

112
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,470
Food!

113
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,260
Food!

114
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,980
Hey! What's going on? What happened?

115
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,440
Oh. It seems someone suddenly
died in the restaurant.

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,530
Suddenly died?!

117
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,410
He supposedly died in the middle
of a conversation with the owner!

118
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,200
He's a traveler.

119
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,450
We think he unwittingly ate a
Desert Strawberry while traveling...

120
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,240
A Desert Strawberry?

121
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,170
They're poisonous spiders that
look like red strawberries.

122
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,510
Eat one by accident, and you'll
suddenly keel over a few days later.

123
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,970
Contagious poison spreads through
your corpse a few hours after that,

124
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,720
so nobody can get close.

125
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,900
In the desert, what you
don't know can kill ya.

126
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Just look! The way he's
still stuck holding the meat

127
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,670
is proof of just how powerful
the Desert Strawberry's poison is!

128
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,370
He came back to life!

129
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,000
A-Are you all right?

130
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,840
Oh, whoops.

131
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,600
I fell asleep.

132
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,650
You were asleep?!

133
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,190
Th-That's absurd! You were in the
middle of a conversation and a meal!

134
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,320
And now he's eating again!

135
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,270
What's all this commotion, anyway?

136
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,280
We were worried about you!

137
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,970
Does this restaurant do
comedy skits or something?

138
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,290
No, it's not like that.
But it's good you're alright.

139
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,740
Hey, now! Don't sleep again!

140
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,800
Aw, so he wasn't dead after all?

141
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Just a false alarm...

142
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,360
That hit the spot!

143
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,150
Say, Mister.

144
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,350
Yeah?!

145
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Has this guy been in town?

146
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,380
He's a pirate who wears a straw hat...

147
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm impressed you're bold
enough to eat out in public...

148
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,310
...Second Division Commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates...

149
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,730
...Portgas D. Ace.

150
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,870
Wh-Whitebeard?! The Whitebeard Pirates?!

151
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,470
That dimwit is one of the
Whitebeard Pirates?!

152
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,090
Come to think of it, I have seen
the mark on his back before!

153
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,930
That's the mark of
the Whitebeard Pirates!

154
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,870
What's he doing here?!

155
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,350
What is a famous, big-shot
pirate doing in this country?

156
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,340
I'm searching...

157
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,030
for my little brother!

158
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:13,960
Food place!

159
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,590
What is that?! There's a
weird smell in the way!

160
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,460
Oh! There's one! There's a food place!

161
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,200
So? What do you want from me?

162
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,940
To let me capture you quietly.

163
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,880
Nope. I think I'll pass.

164
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,940
Yeah, I figured.

165
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm busy trying to find
another pirate at the moment.

166
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,500
To be honest, I have no
interest in taking you in.

167
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,270
Then just look the other way.

168
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,420
Can't.

169
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,040
Not as long as I'm a marine...

170
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,230
and you're a pirate.

171
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,270
That's a bland reason.

172
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,380
Let's have some fun.

173
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,860
Gum-Gum...

174
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,420
Rocket!

175
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,930
A food place! I finally found one!

176
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,590
Now I can eat! I'm starving!

177
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,380
Old guy! Food! Food! Food!
On the double!

178
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,490
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Food! Food! Food!

179
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,060
Yum! This is such a yum food place!

180
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,260
Y-Yeah. Thanks. But...

181
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,880
Uhh, you should probably
run away while you can...

182
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,140
How come?

183
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,220
That guy that got sent flying
just now... Do you know who he is?

184
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,890
Huh? Who sent someone flying?

185
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,390
You did!

186
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,510
I did? Who went flying?

187
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,010
What's with these holes?

188
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,280
What a weird shop!
Is this your hobby, old guy?

189
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,070
You caused it!

190
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,790
I did? When?

191
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,410
Why, you--!

192
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,500
Who the hell did this?!

193
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,450
What the hell?!

194
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,450
What's the big idea?!

195
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,630
Oh! Sorry for disturbing your meal!

196
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,590
What idiot would do
something this crazy?!

197
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:30,860
Lu--!

198
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,440
Hey! Luf--!

199
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,970
Straw Hat!

200
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,500
I've been looking for you, Straw Hat!

201
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,650
So you did come to Alabasta!

202
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,710
Quit eating!

203
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,290
Isn't he...

204
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,520
You're finally here, Straw Hat Luffy...

205
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,350
Didn't I tell you you can't enter
the Grand Line unless you beat me?

206
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,010
What?! What?! What's going on?!

207
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,310
I ate the Plume-Plume Fruit.
So my body becomes smoke at will.

208
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,390
Gum-Gum Pistol!

209
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,950
You get it? You can't even
enter the Grand Line.

210
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,470
Didn't I tell you that?!

211
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,500
You're that smoke!
What're you doing here?!

212
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,220
Bastard...

213
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,360
Hold it!

214
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,310
Thank you for the meal!

215
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,270
Huh?

216
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,230
Halt!

217
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,400
Wait, Luffy! It's me!

218
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,380
Hey! Wait up! Hey! Luffy!

219
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,380
They ran off without paying...

220
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,430
This is bad! My Gum-Gum moves
don't work on that guy at all!

221
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,330
All I can do for now is run!

222
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,410
Tashigi!

223
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,810
Y-Yes, Captain Smoker?!
Do you want a towel?

224
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,600
This kingdom certainly is hot!

225
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,770
Catch that guy! It's Straw Hat!

226
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,460
Straw Hat?!

227
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,240
I'll stop him!

228
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,990
Tashigi! Gather the marines at once!

229
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,870
Search every square inch of
this town for Straw Hat's crew!

230
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,030
Yes, sir!

231
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,790
People with powers are fighting!

232
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,780
Whoa!

233
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,490
Straw Hat's crew! That means...

234
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,920
Roronoa Zoro is in this city!

235
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,050
White Snake!

236
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,560
Straw Hat! Why did you
come to this kingdom?!

237
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,060
What are you after?!

238
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,280
What am I after? I'm here to
beat up a guy named Crocodile!

239
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,010
What?! Crocodile?!

240
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,220
How are you and Crocodile connected?!

241
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,040
He disappeared!

242
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,030
Bastard thinks he's crafty!

243
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,030
Straw Hat!

244
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,340
Where could Luffy-san have gone?

245
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,210
Geez! He's always such
a high-maintenance captain!

246
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,830
Oh! Nami-san!

247
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,020
Hey, now! This is bad!

248
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,810
It feels like we'll be in big trouble
if we don't get moving quick!

249
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,050
Big trouble?

250
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,650
The Navy is here.

251
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,520
The Navy?!

252
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,900
And a strange man!

253
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,610
Let's just find Luffy as quickly
as possible and leave town!

254
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,520
Hey! Hide!

255
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,290
What for?!

256
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,150
What is it?!

257
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,450
Get back here!

258
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,470
The Navy!

259
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,640
There seems to be a big commotion!

260
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,530
Don't let him escape! After him!

261
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,250
Some idiot pirate must be
running around town or something.

262
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,320
Idiot pirate?!

263
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,760
Get back here, Straw Hat!

264
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,700
It's you?!

265
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,620
Heya! Zoro!

266
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,640
Oh! Is that where you guys are?!

267
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,910
You idiot! Go get rid of them first!

268
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,630
There's the Straw Hat crew! Over there!

269
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,150
So, what should we do now?!

270
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,380
We have to run, obviously!

271
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,100
Hurry! To the ship!

272
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,150
What're you doing?! Let's get back!

273
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,060
Hey, you!

274
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,220
Stop!

275
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,360
Don't let them escape!

276
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,870
Fall back!

277
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,770
Captain!

278
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,720
Straw Hat is mine!

279
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,330
Yikes! Yikes! Here he comes!

280
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,700
White Blow!

281
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,540
Uh oh!

282
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,610
There's no escape!

283
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,610
Heat Haze!

284
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,350
You, huh?

285
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,790
Give it up.

286
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,490
You may be smoke, but I'm fire.

287
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,260
A fight between your power
and mine would never end.

288
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,540
He had Devil Fruit powers?!

289
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,280
Who is he, anyways?!
Why is he helping us?!

290
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,740
Ace?!

291
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,070
You haven't changed a bit, Luffy.

292
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,420
Ace?! Is that you, Ace?!
You ate a Devil Fruit?!

293
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,540
Yep! The Flare-Flare Fruit!

294
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,010
Captain Smoker!
We're securing the perimeter!

295
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,360
Anyways, we can't chat like this!
I'll catch up! You guys run!

296
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,960
I'll hold these guys off!

297
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,070
Go!

298
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,980
Let's go!

299
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,920
Yeah!

300
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,820
But, Luffy!

301
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,380
Who is that guy?!

302
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,890
I don't get it.
Why are you helping Straw Hat?

303
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,130
It's natural for a big brother to
worry about his bungling kid brother.

304
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,570
What? Brother? You mean to say--?

305
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,430
Move, Portgas D. Ace!

306
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,190
I'm afraid that's a no-can-do.

307
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,780
Wait, Luffy! Who is he?!

308
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,730
Is he an acquaintance of yours?!

309
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,790
Yeah!

310
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,690
He's my brother!

311
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,530
Brother?!

312
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,820
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

313
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:36,960
From today forth,
something's going to change

314
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:47,220
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

315
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:57,640
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

316
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:08,110
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

317
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:16,500
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

318
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,170
Before dawn

319
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,800
Guys! This is my brother, Ace! Say hi!

320
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,260
This sensible man can't
possibly be your brother!

321
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,050
I would've expected him to
be as reckless as Luffy!

322
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,260
He's a nice guy who
cares about his brother!

323
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,640
