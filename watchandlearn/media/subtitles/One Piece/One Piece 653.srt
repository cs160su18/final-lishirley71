The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980
Running at full speed

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

Keep on advancing

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,260
The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

Go along with your curiosity

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,310
and go wherever you want to
go - that's the adventure

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,340
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,550
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,870
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,450
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

77
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,730
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

78
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,060
he decided to enter and fight
fierce battles against other tough

79
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,910
contenders from the New World.

80
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,250
Fujitora?

81
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,610
Excuse me.

82
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,460
Why did you help him?

83
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,210
I have to stop you right there,
Heavenly Demon.

84
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,790
I'm here to...

85
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,600
...arrest him, not to kill him.

86
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,180
By the way,

87
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,350
you seem quite curious about
that "complication" that I mentioned.

88
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,650
Do you wanna hear about it?

89
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,310
"A Decisive Battle!
Giolla vs. the Straw Hats!"

90
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,590
A long time ago...

91
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,000
It goes back 800 years, Law.

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,560
20 kings from 20 countries came together

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,780
at the center of the world

94
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,910
and formed one giant organization.

95
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,370
That's what we call
the World Government now.

96
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,080
The kings who created it...

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,270
...decided to move to the
Holy land of Marie Jois

98
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,730
and live there with their families.

99
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,230
The Nefeltari Family of Alabasta refused,

100
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,570
so there were 19 families to be exact.

101
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,710
The descendents of those
creators who still live there

102
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,570
and reign over the world
are the Celestial Dragons.

103
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,430
It means, however, that those

104
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,050
19 countries lost their royal
families 800 years ago.

105
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,150
Are you following?

106
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,500
In those countries, they elected
new kings out of necessity

107
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,320
and new royal families rose.

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,800
In the case of my country - Dressrosa,

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,840
the new royalty was the Riku Family.

110
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,880
And the old royalty who moved to the

111
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,310
Holyland of Marie Jois as the
creators of the world were

112
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,850
...the Don Quixote Family!

113
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,930
That means you're...

114
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,210
It's so fun!

115
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,070
The great music and the art of the sea, yeah!

116
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,970
You sure know art, don't you?!

117
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,650
Stop the ship!

118
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,770
Don't tell me you're going to Green Bit!

119
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,130
Law would be stunned!

120
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,120
If I come to pick up Caesar,
not you guys!

121
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,150
Brook is acting strange!
Are you gonna turn around on us?!

122
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,510
Bone-kichi!

123
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,020
You call yourself a swordsman
but betray your friends?!

124
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,670
I just realized something!

125
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm an artist after all!
I'm living to create!

126
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm dead though!

127
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,360
Boy!

128
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,310
These ordinary people can't
understand, Soul King!

129
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,450
More than anything, we
want to express ourselves!

130
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,140
They don't understand that kind of passion!

131
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,830
This is an art of life! Dying Art!

132
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,030
That's amazing, Giolla-san!

133
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,220
No!

134
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,690
Help!

135
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,790
I'm fine...

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,490
I couldn't be more excited!

137
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,880
I represented the tragedy of
Dressrosa quite exquisitely!

138
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,730
In 10 minutes or so,
these annoying kids will

139
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,630
become part of the art completely

140
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,000
and choke to death!

141
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,670
--What?!
--Brook!

142
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,310
Bone-kichi!

143
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,480
I can't tell you how impressed I am!

144
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,940
Let me play a song to celebrate!

145
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,500
Would you mind doing so, Soul King?!

146
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,450
Yes, I'd love to!

147
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,390
So could you turn my violin
and bow back, Giolla-san?

148
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,640
Alright! Take it away, brother!

149
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,860
Wow, thank you!

150
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,960
No!

151
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm not... suffering...

152
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,890
I'm almost unconscious...

153
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,640
I don't wanna die!

154
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,200
Take a look at this, Giolla-san,
this bow is actually a cane sword.

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,640
Uh-huh, uh-huh, play nice music for me!

156
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,870
Okay! I cut you already.

157
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,390
Cut me?!

158
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,900

I'm sorry but I don't understand
art after all because...

162
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,890
...my eyes

163
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,890
KNOTHOLE

164
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
are like knotholes!

165
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,690
Brook!

166
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,660
Bone-kichi!

167
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,140
I started to worry
about Nami-san before you did!

168
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,640
And I know she wants me
to come instead of you!

169
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,500
So I'm going!

170
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Alright! Go!

171
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,330
Kin'emon, this is a map to the
Toy House where your friend is.

172
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Oh, thank you!

173
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,290
When you get to see Luffy,
contact the Sunny with this.

174
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,500
Let's check to see what everybody is doing.

175
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,810
I'll stay on the Sunny.

176
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,990
Now, how can we reach Luffy?

177
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,870
If I knew how,
we wouldn't be standing here.

178
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,700
The place is all closed up

179
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,740
and I don't see anybody to ask.

180
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,430
We should not make a bold move.
I almost got caught earlier.

181
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,740
Then should I just chop up the wall?

182
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,160
That's what I call a bold move!

183
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,530
I can slice it gently instead?

184
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,440
That's not the point! Boy!

185
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,370
--We have to be careful!
--How do you want me to cut it then?!

186
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,860
That's "Pirate Hunter" Zoro-senpai!

187
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,050
They say he chopped up 100 men
in Whisky Peak

188
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,170
and rampaged through Enies Lobby!

189
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,570
The Three-Sword Style swordsman!

190
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,120
He's always supporting the Straw Hats
as Luffy-senpai's right-hand man

191
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,930
and is considered vice captain!

192
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,210
He's so cool!

193
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,480
Oh? Why am I crying? Why?

194
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,090
Zoro-senpai!!

195
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,620
Do you know that man?

196
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,030
Who the hell is he?

197
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,900
Yeah! Go, Rebecca!

198
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,020
You did it! Way to go!
She made another guy drop!

199
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,410
Go, go! Whew! Awesome!

200
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,820
He's getting really excited.

201
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,550
Go, Rebecca!

202
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,170
I'm so glad to be back to myself!

203
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,310
Thanks, Brook!

204
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,800
You did great, Bone-kichi.
You made me happy.

205
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,230
Yeah, I thought I was
gonna die at that moment.

206
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,390
You saved us, Brook.

207
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,940
Well, it's not that big a deal...

208
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,730
I mean, it is a very big deal! Yes!

209
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,540
Let's have a sleep-in-your-lap party!

210
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,360
What kind of party is that?!

211
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,820
That hurts, Nami-san.

212
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,300
Now,

213
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,230
handcuff her, Brook.

214
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,710
What?! Me?!

215
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,600
I don't wanna touch those.
They drain my energy.

216
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,860
Stop complaining and just do it!

217
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,940
You're the only one who hasn't
eaten a Devil Fruit here

218
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,230
so why don't you...

219
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,360
I said "Do it"!

220
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,140
Oh boy, oh boy!

221
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,330
Soul King! How dare you!

222
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,410
I got fooled completely!

223
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,130
I thought we were connected
to each other because we're

224
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,850
both artists and I dropped my guard!

225
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,040
You guys are such imprudent people!

226
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,250
I'm gonna imprint my
ultimate art on your mind

227
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,400
and send you off to heaven!

228
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
G-Giolla-san... R-Relax...

229
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,330
Heaven's Door Art!

230
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,010
--What the hell?!
--What happened?

231
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,640
What?!

232
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,150
This is the pinnacle of artistry -
Heaven's Door Art!

233
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,730
Oh, how beautiful this world of art is!

234
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,930
You guys should be happy!

235
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,690
Because you can die
seeing the most

236
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,820
beautiful thing in the world!

237
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,500
DRESSROSA - THE PALACE

238
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,700
Gladius, why don't you cool down
a little bit?

239
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,230
Baby 5.

240
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,910
Can't you see how badly

241
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,170
that woman's betrayal
upsets our plan?

242
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,200
The plan was simple: that woman, Violet,
captures "Black Foot" Sanji

243
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,320
and looks into his mind
to see all of their strategies.

244
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,330
With that, we could foil all of their plans
and kill them all one by one.

245
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,240
But what did she do instead?!

246
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,400
She beat up her own men and ran!

247
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,500
No, calm down!

248
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,880
You're not gonna explode here, are you?!

249
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,310
I despise and wish death
upon people who aren't

250
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,250
punctual and who can't follow a plan!

251
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,400
GLADIUS
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY (THE PICA ARMY)

252
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,150
What's worse, she betrayed us - I mean,

253
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,340
the Young Master. I'm not gonna
let her get away with that!

254
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,660
Violet was acting strange from last night.

255
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Think about it.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,660
With her Clairvoyance, she could've found
the Straw Hat's ship yesterday.

257
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,430
NORTHEAST DRESSROSA
IN THE DIRECTION OF GREEN BIT

258
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,950
Hey, you're not supposed
to be here, Violet-chan!

259
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,800
I told you to wait at the harbor!

260
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,560
The Navy soldiers are
everywhere at the harbor.

261
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,050
You and your friends may want to
change your rendezvous point.

262
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,880
I see. The Navy...

263
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,930
There are four Navy ships.

264
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,820
At least three thousand Navy soldiers
are here now.

265
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,470
You found out all of that alone
in that short amount of time?

266
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,920
It's one of my abilities.

267
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,100
Clairvoyance.

268
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,480
With this power, I can see
things within a 4000km

269
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,020
diameter as from a bird's point of view.

270
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,150
I can see everything that's
going in this country from here.

271
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,060
So you don't have to worry about me.

272
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,010
They can't catch me.

273
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,610
Then, are you gonna stay in this country?

274
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,740
No. Don't worry.

275
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,800
What I'm gonna do is...

276
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,230
Violet-chan?

277
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,680
It's odd.

278
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,750
I can't find your ship anywhere!

279
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,120
What?!

280
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,140
What should we do?! Hey!
What should we do?!

281
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,600
What can we do?!

282
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,040
We've no choice but to fight!

283
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,550
Weather Egg!

284
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,390
Come hatch, thunder-chan!

285
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,760
Take it!

286
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,320
What the hell is this?

287
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,670
What?!

288
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,440
Your technique is not very beautiful.

289
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,780
For these kinds of things, I would do this...

290
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
...and this...

291
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,660
...and this, to accentuate its beauty!

292
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,600
Brook!

293
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,170
Will you excuse me
for cutting you, Giolla-san?!

294
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,620
This Heaven's Door Art is imbued with my soul

295
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,930
for pursuing ultimate beauty!

296
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,830
The greatest beauty is the strongest!

297
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,130
Cola barrels have been set!

298
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,070
Nice, Chopper!

299
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,560
What is this?

300
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,970
It's the Sunny's source of power.

301
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,410
With that, we can fire the Gaon Cannon!

302
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,780
The Gaon Cannon?!

303
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,660
If I remember correctly,
I put a target in the circle with this.

304
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,000
I wish Usopp were here
but the target is big so I can do it!

305
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,020
Brook! It's ready!
Get out of the way!

306
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,170
I got it!

307
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,510
Okay!

308
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,050
Alright! Here we go!

309
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,350
The Gaon Cannon!

310
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,420
Fire!

311
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,130
What is that?

312
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,530
Yes!

313
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,010
How dare you!
I'm not gonna let you get away with it!

314
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,080
--Just how tough is she?!
--She just won't go away!

315
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,190
I'm gonna go all out now!
You pissed me off!

316
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,260
Alright, who wants to die first?!

317
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,830
Head blow!

318
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,840
You damn brat!

319
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,770
Momo-chan, move aside!

320
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,460
--What's wrong?
--It's bad.

321
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,480
Your ship emerged out of nowhere

Lightning?!

00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,470
Oh, lightning...

Wh-Who did you call Ms. Mermaid...

325
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,670
--You did it, Momonosuke!
--Yes, I did!

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,060
No problem!
