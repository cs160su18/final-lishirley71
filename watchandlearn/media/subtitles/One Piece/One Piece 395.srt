2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,820
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,750
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,000
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,640
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,440
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,910
drove people around
the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,210
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,800
Find it!

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,880
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,950
In search of a coating craftsman
to help them reach Fish-Man Island,

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,700
the Straw Hat crew
visited the Sabaody Archipelago

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,390
along with Hachi and Camie's group.

52
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,350
However, Camie was abducted,

53
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,410
and is about to be sold
as a slave at a human auction!

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,570
"Time Limit
-- The Human Auction Begins"

55
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,210
"Navy Headquarters"

56
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,760
"Dark King" Silvers Rayleigh, huh...

57
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,730
Apparently, no one around him
recognizes him,

58
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,600
so he's being sold
as a regular old man...

59
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,480
The Dark King,
being sold at a human auction?

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
It is hard to believe something like this
would happen to the real one.

61
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,640
My men aren't 100% sure
it's really him, either...

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,230
Tea!

63
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,280
Oh, thank you.

64
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,920
What should we do, Vice-Admiral?

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Shall we report this
to Fleet Admiral Sengoku?

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,480
No, I'll handle this myself.

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,060
Don't tell anyone about it, now.

68
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,040
Not even Sengoku!

69
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,120
Give your men a convenient story!

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,260
But, what if it really is him?

71
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,810
It's him, all right.

72
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,390
I'm sure of it.

73
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,740
I hear reports of him
being seen on occasion.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,940
If I had to guess,

75
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,950
I'd say he probably lost
while gambling and sold himself.

76
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,380
He may be an old soldier,

77
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,300
but if we take Rayleigh on foolishly,

78
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,320
our forces will lose an
unthinkable number of men.

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,370
Now is an especially bad time.

80
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,330
Are you suggesting the navy
take on two "legends" at once?!

81
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,220
Okay, ladies and gentlemen!

82
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,430
It's the moment you've been waiting for!

83
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,890
Grove #1's monthly

84
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,480
Great Human Auction is about to begin!

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,210
And your emcee, of course, is this man!

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,240
Sometimes known as the
Walking Super Bazaar...

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,790
...Mr. Disco!

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,210
Hello, everyone!

89
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,490
I have some great-quality
slaves again for you today!

90
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,970
You're lucky!

91
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,640
We even have a super-great
showcase item for sale today!

92
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,190
I pray from the bottom of my heart

93
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,640
that you'll get to take home
the slaves of your choice!

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,960
What are you planning to purchase today?

95
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,980
The last human slave I bought

96
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,400
didn't even last 10 days
before it broke down.

97
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,360
So I'm hoping to procure a young
and durable male giant today.

98
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,020
I'm considering buying two
or three young girls for eye candy.

99
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,710
Oh, you certainly do love those!

100
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,850
I can't wait to see what
cuties they'll have today!

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,380
Oh, you!

102
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,920
Well, then!
Let's get this auction started!

103
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,200
Get #2 and #3 ready.

104
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,010
Right!

105
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,870
Entry #1!

106
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,930
From Troa in West Blue!

107
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,380
A proud pirate from a
long line of musicians

108
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,310
and versatile with musical instruments!

109
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,560
Give him an instrument, and he'll play
any background music you request!

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,890
He's a human music box!

111
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,140
He's also a great cleaner!

112
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,900
Give him a mop, and he won't
miss a single speck of dust!

113
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,530
In addition,
he's skilled at making wine!

114
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,370
A hard-working 25 year old male human!

115
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
192 centimeters and 130 kilograms!

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,250
Goes by the name of Byron!

117
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,210
Bidding will start at the special
offer price of 480,000 Berries!

118
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,050
Okay! Raise your bidding paddles
and name your price!

119
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,890
Well, 480,000 is a steal!

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,640
#7 bids 480,000!

121
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,020
Any other bidders?!

122
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,610
Any other bidders?!

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,590
500,000!

124
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,900
#82 has just bid 500,000 Berries!

125
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,160
520,000!

126
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,570
Yes! #105 bids 520,000 Berries!

127
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,230
I have 520,000!

128
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,330
This is a great value, you know!

129
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,900
He can play music, perform housework,

130
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,310
and as a pirate,
he'll make a great guard-dog!

131
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,670
Are there any other bidders?!

132
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,840
Any other bidders?!

133
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,340
530,000!

134
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,730
550,000!

135
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,590
600,000!

136
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,070
#7 bids 600,000!

137
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,890
Any other bids?!

138
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,740
Sold, for 600,000 Berries!

139
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,040
Using by-bidders to enliven the place
and raise prices to their limits...

140
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,050
This is the pro technique and skill

141
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,640
of Mr. Disco-sama,
the Walking Super Bazaar!

142
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,690
Okay! There are many more
great deals to come!

143
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,880
Be sure not to miss your chance,
ladies and gentlemen!

144
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,930
Now, then!
Let's move on to the next item!

145
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,400
"Human Buying and Selling"

146
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,700
What is this disgusting list, Duval?!

147
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,370
They're market prices!

148
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,290
Market prices?

149
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,700
The general minimum value
of humans is 500,000 Berries...

150
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,290
Male giants are worth
50 million Berries...

151
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,660
What?!

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,680
Female mermaids are worth
70 million Berries?!

153
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,550
Now do you see why everyone
wants to catch mermaids?

154
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,200
They're in a class of their own!

155
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,900
Once you buy one,
you're free to have it do whatever you want,

156
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,580
but most are used by rich people
as decorations.

157
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,320
They spend the rest of their lives
in cramped fish tanks as eye candy.

158
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,990
What the hell are you trying to say?!

159
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,720
Oh, it's just that when I think about it,
that's not living at all.

160
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,700
If you feel that way,
then find her already!

161
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,960
This is Fish #20!
I've checked all the kidnapping groups here!

162
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,840
There's no word in this area
about a mermaid being abducted!

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
No mermaid info here, either!

164
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,020
Damn!

165
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,480
No leads at all here, either!

166
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,710
Hurry up already!

167
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,420
Gimme a break!

168
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,850
It ain't a bird!
It needs a running start!

169
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,660
Camie! Where are you?!

170
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,290
It pisses me off!

171
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,900
I mean seriously, it's a giant!

172
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,400
Catching one that was asleep
was nice and all,

173
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,830
but it took so much work
just to haul the thing here!

174
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,420
You'd normally think our item
would be the main event, right?!

175
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,830
But then some guy brought in a mermaid
just before the auctions started!

176
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,100
So how can I not drink now?!

177
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,170
H-Hold on! Who was this guy?!

178
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,330
This is Fish #5!

179
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,110
Attention, all Rosy Life Riders!

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,190
Do you read me?

181
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,870
It was Peterman who
kidnapped the mermaid!

182
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,280
He sold her to the
auction house on Grove #1!

183
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,120
Peterman?!

184
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,330
Do you know where that is?!

185
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,540
Yeah! Let's step on it!

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,670
This is a bit fast!
It's frightening!

187
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,630
Don't tell me she's been
sold to someone already?!

188
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,810
Hurry!

189
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,760
Grove #1 is right nearby!

190
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,590
Leave it to me!

191
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,340
Our destination is the auction house!

192
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,360
We know where she is?!

193
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,390
Thank goodness!

194
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,140
Camie!

195
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,810
Hurry!

196
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,180
I'm tryin' to get back to my ship.

197
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,200
Do you know where the #1 trees are?

198
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,570
Sure, I'll tell you!

199
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,580
Oh? I appreciate it.

200
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,670
Listen!

201
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,420
You ain't going back anywhere now...

202
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,750
...Pirate Hunter Zoro-san!

203
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,840
Your 120 million Berry bounty is mine!

204
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,800
U-Uhh, let me think! Grove #1 is...!

205
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,980
Okay! Let's move on!

206
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,190
Next up is Entry #6!

207
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,610
A 10-pack of male human laborers!

208
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,110
Head here!

209
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,660
Attention all units!

210
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,950
Check today's auction schedule!

211
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,910
It starts at 4:00,

212
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,580
so it's been going for 30 minutes now!

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,790
Hey, are we gonna make it?!

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,760
Don't worry.

215
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,340
Mermaids are always the
big showcase items,

216
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,130
so they won't auction her off
until the last half!

217
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,400
We'll make it in time!

218
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,270
Just take the shortest distance!

219
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,880
You're slower than the flying fish!

220
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,220
Just stay calm, Young Master Black Leg!

221
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,000
I am the head of the team!

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,040
Have I changed course
after hearing where the mermaid is?!

223
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,540
No...

224
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,970
That's because

225
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,570
I've been heading for Grove #1
from the very start!

226
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,660
Look ahead! That's Grove #1!

227
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,080
Crashing the place first goes to show
why I'm head of the team!

228
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,700
Seriously?!

229
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,200
Was it "colleague's intuition"
or something?!

230
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,580
We're here, Mr. Reindeer!

231
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,050
Yes! Thanks!

232
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,380
Oh, Sanji!

233
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,530
You didn't make it here first!

234
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,490
Sanji-kun! Chopper!

235
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,420
Nami-swan!

236
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,500
Hey! Everyone!

237
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,090
Camie!

238
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,740
Be careful!

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,150
Yeah! Thanks!

240
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,500
Who's this guy?!

241
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,690
Two million berries!

242
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,260
Any other bids?

243
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,580
Sold!

244
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,920
This the place?!

245
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,330
Why can't you give her back?!

246
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,590
You have no business selling Camie-chan!

247
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,260
You're the one who has no business here!

248
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,970
If you keep pestering us,
we'll take legal action against you

249
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,350
for obstruction of business!

250
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,350
Damn them...!

251
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,940
Business my ass, you damn bastard!

252
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,940
A business like this has
no place in this world!

253
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,900
An outlaw pirate has no business
lecturing me about being humane!

254
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,460
Buying and selling people
is taboo throughout the world!

255
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,060
How much are you paying the government?!

256
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,180
That's not a very nice thing to say.

257
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,540
But, yes...!

258
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,950
Even when people from the government
or navy talk with us,

259
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,170
they apparently have a hard time
hearing the phrase "human trafficking"

260
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,220
so it's as if they don't know
about the existence of this industry at all!

261
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,430
What a load of crap!
You're all in this together!

262
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,960
I can't believe the
government quietly allows this!

263
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,240
How can this be happening?!

264
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,470
This is horrible!

265
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,900
That's just the way it is.

266
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,320
There's nothing you can do about it.

267
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,260
Which is why you're also--

268
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,360
This is annoying!

269
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,320
If we're sure the mermaid's here,
then this is all we need to do!

270
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,370
Weapons...!

271
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,090
No!

272
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,770
There are Celestial Dragons inside,

273
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,090
and if Camie is being held here,

274
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,080
then she must have a collar on by now!

275
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,680
Eh?!

276
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,250
Those ones that explode?!

277
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,050
We can't just go
and take her out of there then!

278
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,490
Please, feel free to leave!

279
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,290
Damn you!

280
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,560
No, we can't do that, Sanji!

281
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,950
Let go, Chopper!

282
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,200
No, Sanji!

283
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,190
Dammit...!

284
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,980
There's no getting through to you!

285
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,190
Hey, girl!
Where are you going?!

286
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,800
Calm down, Sanji!

287
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,710
Nami-san?!

288
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,780
If we can't use force,

289
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,160
then we'll get Camie back
using their rules!

290
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,840
Bring out #15 and #16.

291
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,510
Right!

292
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,180
No!

293
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,270
Stop!

294
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,370
I don't want this!

295
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,280
I'd much rather stay locked up!

296
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,150
I don't want to be a slave!

297
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,650
Help me! Help me!

298
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,490
Sedate him!

299
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,950
Call the navy! Please!

300
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,350
Please don't sell me to someone!

301
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,160
Hatchin... Save me...

302
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,520
Boss.

303
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,720
Isn't that the Straw Hat crew?

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,360
The Straw Hat captain ain't with 'em.

305
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,440
I was hoping to see just how much
of a crazy bastard he is, but...

306
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,530
Now, then! Next up is Entry #14!

307
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,420
This item is a female human!

308
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,850
Aside from housekeeping,

309
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,600
she's also an expert in games,
ranging from cards to chess!

310
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,450
She'll be great to have
when you want to pass the time!

311
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,660
Let's start the bidding
at 600,000 Berries!

312
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,520
Oh, this could be an excellent bargain!

313
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,350
Drat!

314
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,150
I used up my entire budget
on the female human I just bid on!

315
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,330
This one is clearly much better, too!

316
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,780
That's a shame!

317
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,220
But I do believe I'll bid on this one!

318
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,690
700,000 Berries!

319
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,220
900,000 Berries!

320
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,310
1 million 200 thousand!

321
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,940
1 million 500 thousand!

322
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,940
2 million!

323
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,320
Bastards...

324
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,780
3 million!

325
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,880
#51 has bid 3 million Berries!

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,160
Are there any other bids?!

327
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,000
Any other bids?!

328
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,210
Sold to #51 for 3 million Berries!

329
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,710
Is Camie going to wind up
like this, too?

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,430
We will get her back! Just you watch!

331
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,890
But, in this situation, how...?!

332
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,190
We have quite a lot of treasure
on our ship right now.

333
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,270
Altogether, I think it's
worth at least 200 million.

334
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,570
What's the market price for mermaids?

335
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,240
That should be more than enough,
but I can't pay you back!

336
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,320
What're you talking about, Hachi?

337
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,620
Are you Camie's guardian or something?

338
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,080
It's not like that!

339
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,340
If it's to get our friend back,

340
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,090
then I don't care how much it costs!

341
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,290
You guys okay with that?!

342
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,380
Of course we are!

343
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,750
This isn't about money!

344
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,320
Guys... Thank you!

345
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,530
I'll never forget this
for the rest of my life!

346
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,760
I love Nami-san when she's like that!

347
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,190
Shut up. Come on.

348
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,810
Extra! Extra!

349
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,190
Is the World Government crazy?!

350
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,650
Is this for real?! If they do that...!

351
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,820
Captain! This is bad!

352
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,620
So that's why?

353
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,950
What is it, Captain Drake?!

354
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,020
It finally makes sense.

355
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,420
I wondered why there were
so few marines on these islands,

356
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,910
despite being so close
to Navy Headquarters...

357
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,090
What's happened?!

358
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,700
Whitebeard's second division commander,

359
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,730
Fire Fist Ace, is being
given a public execution!

360
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,930
But won't Whitebeard
take action if they do that?!

361
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,770
There's going to be a war!

362
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,770
Okay!

363
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,380
Things are really picking up
here at the Great Human Auction!

364
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,570
Next up is another
highly-recommended item!

365
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,860
Entry #15 is an unbelievably
beautiful female slave!

366
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,800
Just look at these
miraculous proportions!

367
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,050
This is Pashia, a 20 year old dancer!

368
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,980
The sight of Pashia--

369
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,240
one of our showcase items today--

370
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,460
is guaranteed to beguile
and lead you to heaven!

371
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,800
800,000!

372
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,700
Already, bidding for the beautiful
dancer Pashia is at 800,000!

373
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,480
1 million!

374
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,890
1 million 500 thousand!

375
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,010
3 million!

376
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,420
Bidding has jumped straight
to 3 million Berries!

377
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,720
Are there any other bids?!

378
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,620
What the hell?!

379
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,070
What do all these people
take ladies for?!

380
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,320
We will save her!

381
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,720
I refuse to let Camie
get sold to the likes of them!

382
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,620
Hurry!

383
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,080
Hurry!

384
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,370
I know!

385
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,240
Hurry to Grove #1!

386
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,300
This is Grove #2...

387
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,980
The next one must be it.

388
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,890
And you call yourself
a member of the Straw Hats?!

389
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,930
You've been doing nothing
but scream this whole time!

390
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,000
I can't help it;

391
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,360
it's even more frightening
than the rides at Sabaody Park!

392
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
It's like my heart
is about to fly out...

393
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,770
I don't have a heart, though!

394
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,820
Geez!

395
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,780
Your face is a whole lot scarier,
if you ask me!

396
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,540
I wonder if everyone's already there?!

397
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,880
We will save you!

398
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,640
Hang on, Camie!

399
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,430
Get #17 ready!

400
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,320
Camie's auction has started!

401
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,310
It's ok!

402
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,500
We've got 200 million berries, after all!

403
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,550
The Celestial Dragons!

404
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,780
Are they planning to buy Camie, too?

405
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,370
My friend's about to be bought and taken away.

406
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,510
I can't let that happen!

407
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm not gonna lose!

408
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,930
I'll get Camie back, no matter what!

409
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,360
On the next episode of One Piece!

410
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,230
The Fist Explodes! Destroy the Auction

411
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
