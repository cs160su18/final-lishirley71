2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,670
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:11,170
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

20
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,690
Laki!

21
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,560
What are you doing?

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,320
Though I guess there's nothing
you can do, hanging there like that...

23
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,910
This is that important to you, huh?

24
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,590
Laki!

25
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,720
Kamakiri!

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,050
Yeah, just thought I'd start hauling
the wood for the ship's repairs...

27
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,510
--You planning to swim across?
--Huh? Yeah.

28
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,330
Those big sharks are in there.

29
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,450
See! This is how Jaya looked 400 years ago!

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,160
--Whoa! It's a skull!
--It looks like a skull!

31
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,580
Well?

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,910
Kamakiri... Your wounds...

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,290
I can still fight!

34
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,380
I can still fight.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,130
You're right-- now is the time
to take down Upper Yard.

36
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,390
With Satori gone, we put up a
good fight during today's battle...

37
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,600
So let's attack again tomorrow, Wyper!

38
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,440
"Enter God Eneru!! Farewell to the Survivors"

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,030
C'mon, Zoro! Just for a second...!

40
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm not goin' with you!

41
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,980
You're such a whiner! If you're scared,
then hold it until morning!

42
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,000
I would if I could!

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,820
Just go pee by yourself.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,220
You're so cold-hearted, Zoro...!

45
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,400
Urgh...

46
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,150
What's that sound?!

47
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,210
There shouldn't be anyone with the ship...

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,140
It's hard to see through all this fog...

49
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,400
What's his deal?

50
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,740
He goes to take a piss, then falls
asleep out here. He's hopeless...

51
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,080
G-Ghost... G-G-Ghost...

52
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,620
Quit dreamin'!

53
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,380
Ghost! A ghost...!

54
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,350
We are...

55
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,760
Hey.

56
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,400
Must be hard to talk while
you're biting your lower lip!

57
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,080
How careless of me.

58
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,420
I'm telling you, Eneru-sama summoned
us because you let Wyper go!

59
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,100
There's no need to get worked up.

60
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:49,050
However much they struggle,
mere Shandians cannot escape us.

61
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,760
Such is their fate!

62
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,180
That's nothing but an excuse!

63
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,820
Had Eneru-sama left it all
to me from the very start,

64
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,980
everything would have
been taken care of today,

65
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,490
and his mood wouldn't have been spoiled!

66
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,660
Gedatsu. It would be
impossible for a fool like you.

67
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,340
What?!

68
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,980
I'll warn you two now.

69
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,290
Know your place,

70
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,960
or else you'll lose control of your
Mantra and end up just like Satori.

71
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,430
You're the one who needs
to know his place, Ohm!

72
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,730
Don't start acting haughty just
'cause you beat ol' Gan Fall, Shura!

73
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,980
Amusing!

74
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,680
God. The priests have arrived.

75
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,720
Open the door.

76
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,500
Not again...

77
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,510
What are you doing?! You're so hopeless...

78
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,560
Quiet! It's only because
these guys drag me down

79
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,890
that I can't use my powers to their fullest!

80
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,270
I would fare much better if you let
me handle the entire island alone!

81
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,050
That's some mighty big talk there!

82
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,620
I'll show you just how "skilled" you really are!

83
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,170
On the sorrowful path of
enlightenment... The Iron Ordeal!

84
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,380
Your worthless ordeal is nothing but pathetic!

85
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,010
My swamp is the supreme ordeal!
Want to give it a try?

86
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,080
Gedatsu-sama. That must be tiring.

87
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,860
To cross your arms, you need to
put your hands under your elbows.

88
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,440
--How careless of me!
--Come! That is enough!

89
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,110
You are in God's presence!

90
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,120
Presence? I don't see him anywhere!

91
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,870
I thought he called us here?!

92
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,620
Where is Eneru-sama?!

93
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Got you!

94
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,440
I am God.

95
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,150
See, I'm right here.

96
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,070
Train some more. You're all too weak.

97
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,410
Surely you don't wish to wind
up as pathetic as Satori did?

98
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,870
What is this?!

99
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,000
What a horrible prank!

100
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,840
You called us here just to tell us that?!

101
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,340
I was bored.

102
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,050
Have a seat.

103
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,160
You don't seem to have taken much
notice of those Blue Sea people...

104
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,920
Eneru-sama. If you're referring to Satori...

105
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,540
He was simply too inexperienced.

106
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,540
With his lousy "Ball Ordeal" and all...

107
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,260
As I said, you're weak, Shura.

108
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,320
Gan Fall is still alive.

109
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,790
Impossible! I finished him off myself!

110
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,380
He's not in tip-top shape...

111
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,600
But he seems to be friends with the
Blue Sea people for some reason...

112
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,440
He's such a stubborn old man!

113
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,550
What exactly are the Blue Sea people after?

114
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,970
Their aim is gold.

115
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Gold...

116
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,900
How do they know about that?

117
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,290
This island was originally part of the Blue Sea.

118
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,780
It's not strange for Blue Sea
people to know about it.

119
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,320
Naturally, they will make their move tomorrow.

120
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,870
And the Shandians will attack again.

121
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,440
The rules are that you each
run an area of Upper Yard,

122
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,890
but you're not allowed to
interfere with one another.

123
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,420
Tomorrow, I will let you enter all areas.

124
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,200
You can set up your ordeals wherever you like.

125
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,220
You can also ignore the rules
and go as wild as you want.

126
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,310
Why this, all of a sudden?

127
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,060
Actually, I've almost completed the Maxim.

128
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,490
So let's put an end to this island
and set forth for the world of dreams!

129
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,620
To think that these people defeated Satori...

130
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,930
They've made themselves
complete enemies of Eneru...

131
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,860
And the Shandians won't
overlook this chance, either...

132
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,720
Damn you, Eneru... Just what is it you desire?!

133
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,940
We did put up a good fight...

134
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,880
Today, we will break into God's shrine!

135
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,540
And then, Eneru will be--

136
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,990
See! It's just like I said! Someone was here!

137
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,710
The Going Merry's been repaired!

138
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,250
I saw it! It wasn't a dream, after all!

139
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,300
The mast was completely
snapped off, but now it's all fixed!

140
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,860
Yes. Just standing this heavy thing
up must be hard work by itself!

141
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,150
Still, I hate to say it, but...

142
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,610
...it sucks.

143
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,740
There sure are nice people out there!

144
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,330
There was someone here! I saw him!

145
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,040
But who'd fix our ship for us out here?

146
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,840
The only people besides us in
Upper Yard are our enemies...

147
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,260
But it's not the flying model anymore, Usopp.

148
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,060
Yeah. That's got me wondering...

149
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,030
How did the person know what
the Merry originally looked like?

150
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,780
How'd they know it didn't have
a crest or wings or a tail?

151
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,700
Who did you see, Usopp?

152
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,100
It really sounds like it could
only happen in a dream...

153
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,420
What're you loafing around for?!

154
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,550
We have lots to do, you know!

155
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,350
You're not curious, Nami?

156
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,930
About what?

157
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,770
About who fixed the Going Merry...

158
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,750
Maybe if someone wrecked it, but
since it's fixed, what does it matter?

159
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,320
Or do you wanna find the
person and thank them?

160
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,400
No, but...

161
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,200
How did they know?

162
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,040
Tell me, Merry. Who was that?

163
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,310
Okay! Watch as I, President of
the Lowering-the-Merry Company,

164
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,400
use my greatness to get the ship off the altar!

165
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm Vice President of the
Lowering-the-Merry Company!

166
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,310
I'm being relied on!

167
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,240
What're you planning to do, Usopp?

168
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,870
Alright!

169
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,600
--Chopper!
--Right!

170
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,340
Fire!

171
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,250
Go!

172
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,480
Yes! Alright!

173
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,230
Chopper! Full speed!

174
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,610
Awesome! You're awesome, Usopp!

175
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,420
That didn't really work, Usopp...

176
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,210
Don't worry, Chopper!

177
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,670
I figured this might happen,
so I devised a secret backup plan!

178
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,760
Really?! What is it?!

179
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,720
There are huge skysharks here, right?

180
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,730
There sure are! Swarms of them!

181
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,060
There is a way we can utilize their power...

182
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,180
The skysharks' power?

183
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,450
Yeah! They got lots of power!
I can guarantee that!

184
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,030
So, Chopper... I got a little job for you...

185
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,160
Anything you say! I'm being relied on!
I'll do anything at all!

186
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,750
Great!

187
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,130
Well said!

188
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,470
U-Usopp! Don't tell me I'm being used as...

189
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,600
Hungry skysharks are gonna try to bite you!

190
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,400
I'm bait?!

191
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,180
No! No! No bait! I don't wanna be eaten!

192
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,620
Now, Sanji!

193
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,010
Alright!

194
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,270
Come on, skyshark!

195
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,280
No!

196
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,120
Don't move!

197
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,660
Move!

198
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,480
All right!

199
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,440
--Hurray! We did it!
--Way to go, Usopp!

200
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,240
Piece o' cake!

201
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,660
No!

202
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,370
Now, then. Here's the map.

203
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,010
The search team will go
this way, straight south...

204
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,890
This "right eye" should
have some sort of ruins,

205
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,200
so watch out for enemies
and bring some gold back!

206
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,110
You make it sound so simple...

207
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,440
I'd love to investigate the ruins!

208
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,560
Huh? You keep talking about
the gold, but you're not coming?

209
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,910
No way! It's scary!

210
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,080
You want the gold, but without any danger!

211
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,440
You're so weird, Nami! Weirdo!

212
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,620
You saying something?

213
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,660
Meanwhile, we'll leave the island in the Merry.

214
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,210
We'll be in danger, too, you know.

215
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,010
We'll head for the beach ruins
area as fast as possible.

216
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,140
Let's meet up there, and then
escape from this sky island!

217
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,720
Then we'll be super-rich pirates!
We can buy whatever we want!

218
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,050
Hurray! I can eat all the meat I want!

219
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,060
Escape, huh? Sounds good to me!

220
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,820
No bait!

221
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,130
Look! It's nice weather today!

222
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,620
We are above the clouds.

223
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,450
Okay! Let's meet safely on the eastern shore!

224
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,710
--Alright!
--Let's get going!

225
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,830
Yeah!

226
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,540
Will it be the Shandians who are
welcomed by my String Ordeal,

227
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,710
or the Blue Sea people?

228
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:01,200
This is perfect weather for
the festival about to begin...

229
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,190
Even if we're far apart

230
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,650
I don't want you to forget

231
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:38,080
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

232
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,480
You have a friend here to share the pain

233
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:52,120
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

234
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:58,670
I won't let it just be a dream

235
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:05,650
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

236
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:13,310
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

237
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,200
Alright! Let's set out for the gold!

238
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm counting on you! Once we get
the gold, we'll be rich pirates!

239
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,840
Things're finally getting interesting!

240
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,470
Bring God and the guerrillas
and everything else on!

241
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,140
I feel reassured with you guys around!
All right! I'll try hard, too!

242
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

243
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,010
"A Giant Snake Bares Its Fangs!
The Survival Game Begins"

244
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,250
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
