2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,550
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,610
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,770
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,390
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,910
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,520
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,030
T-There it is!

25
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,740
What the...?

26
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,290
Who do you take your friends for?!

27
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,620
There they are!

28
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,240
"Anger Explosion!
Kuro vs. Luffy, How it Ends!"

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,820
Tired?

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,040
The Out of the Back Attack does
have lots of unnecessary movement.

31
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,410
Don't get cocky.

32
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,660
Everything so far has been playtime.

33
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,200
You get the special treatment.

34
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,330
I'm going to let you taste plenty
of fear, then slowly cook you!

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,170
Out of the Back Attack!

36
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,600
Just try your foot technique now!

37
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,860
Damn you! Get away from me!

38
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,460
Now your plan of three
years is a complete failure!

39
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,730
What?!

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,890
He caught Captain Kuro!

41
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,500
Hey, if he wins, that means
we won't get killed, right?!

42
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,530
Now you die!

43
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,170
Oh, no, you don't!

44
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,130
You damn kids!

45
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,440
Looks like you're one
step too late, Haramaki!

46
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,520
I wouldn't say so!

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,570
Yes! That branch was in the way!

48
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,070
What?!

49
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,980
Usopp-san...

50
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,550
Get 'im, Rubber Guy!

51
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,330
Kick Captain Kuro's ass!

52
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Get away!

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,990
You guys have no right to cheer me on!

54
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,300
Eat this, hypnotist!

55
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,680
Usopp-san!

56
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,460
--Captain!
--Captain!

57
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,010
Let go!

58
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,840
Gum-Gum...

59
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,520
Special Attack: Exploding Star!

60
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:03,550
--My plan will not be disrupted!
--...Bell...

61
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,650
H-He beat him...

62
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,400
H-He beat Captain Kuro!

63
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,590
Not even the navy was a match
for Kuro, Man of a Thousand Plans!

64
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,330
But he really beat him!

65
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,430
Just who are you?!

66
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Monkey D. Luffy.

67
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,570
I'd never lose to a pirate who ditches
his name and runs from the sea.

68
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,770
The only time a pirate should
abandon his name is when he dies!

69
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,600
L-Luffy?! Yeah, I never
heard that name before!

70
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,710
Remember my name for
the rest of your lives!

71
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,910
I'm the man who's gonna
be King of the Pirates!

72
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,410
This guy's...

73
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,160
Take him and leave!

74
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,910
Never come here again!

75
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,130
Run!

76
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,420
Well done...

77
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,890
--Hurry!
--Raise the anchor!

78
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,340
I'd expect even you to collapse
after all you just went through...

79
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,630
Say.

80
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,150
What were you mad about earlier?

81
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,120
I hate them.

82
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,870
They're wrong.

83
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,720
That's not how friends should act.

84
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,640
What're you talking about?
Of course it's not.

85
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,760
Pirates aren't the lovely things
you make them out to be.

86
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,210
I'd say Captain Kuro's
more standard than you.

87
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,040
I want some meat.

88
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,540
You're unbelievable!

89
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,750
Can you keep everything that's
just happened here a secret?

90
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,640
Eh?! A secret?! How come?!

91
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,580
Yeah! After we just fought
for the village's sake!

92
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,000
Everyone'll change their
opinion of you, too!

93
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,680
You could be the village hero!

94
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,080
--Yeah! Yeah!
--Yeah! Yeah!

95
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,040
Usopp-san. You need to clear up
everyone's misunderstanding...

96
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,960
Misunderstanding? I was only
called an exaggerator, like always.

97
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,490
There's no need to scare everyone
with something that's already over.

98
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,820
Aside from things like this,

99
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,900
no pirates will show up to attack
a remote village like this one.

100
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,110
I'm just going to pretend
that nothing ever happened.

101
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,890
It was all a lie.

102
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,030
I won't force you to, but...

103
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,120
No, I can do it! If it's for
the best of the village!

104
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
Me, too!

105
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,710
Me, too! I'll never say a word, ever!

106
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,030
Kaya...

107
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,880
Will it be hard for you?

108
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,130
No.

109
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,090
Where is Usopp-kun this morning?

110
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,860
It throws everything off for some reason...

111
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,550
I can't get motivated...

112
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,100
Mommy...

113
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,360
Is the liar guy not coming today?

114
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,740
That damn exaggeration-spewing kid...

115
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,780
Where is he today?!

116
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,560
Do you think maybe I was
too harsh yesterday?

117
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,200
He'll be back to his
old tricks come tomorrow!

118
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
I'm sure of it...

119
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,550
Thanks!

120
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,850
I wouldn't have been able to protect
the village without you guys!

121
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,090
What're you talkin' about?

122
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,640
If you hadn't done anything,
I would've done nothing!

123
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,300
Me, too!

124
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,620
Who cares about that?

125
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,020
I got me some treasure!

126
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,290
This incident has helped me
finally come to a decision.

127
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,060
Captain Usopp! What did you
want to talk to us about?!

128
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,920
You guys fought well against
those Black Cat Pirates!

129
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,030
As captain, I feel very proud!

130
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,770
Y-You're too kind...

131
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,080
We're nothing compared to you...

132
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,540
You're embarrassing us!

133
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,440
No, you really did great!

134
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,970
You were scared to death,
but you managed to keep Kaya safe!

135
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,760
We overcame our biggest and
greatest battle since we formed

136
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,300
the Usopp Pirates five years ago,
when you guys were just four!

137
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,200
--Yes!
--Yes!

138
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,730
So, I know this is sudden,

139
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,730
but I've decided to
set out to sea by myself!

140
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm gonna be a real pirate!

141
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,850
I had always been unsure if I
wanted to stay here forever or not...

142
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,540
But, once I saw them,
I finally made up my mind!

143
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,010
I feel that, as a man, I must
set out onto the vast ocean!

144
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,970
So I'm leaving this village!

145
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,140
There's but one reason:

146
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,530
the pirate flag is calling me!

147
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,180
Captain! You're lying, right?!

148
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,010
You're lying again, right?!

149
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,990
It's way too hasty to do that!

150
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,820
Don't you love this village, Captain?!

151
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,740
What'll happen to the Usopp Pirates?!

152
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,200
You've been great to me, guys...

153
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,700
I plan to leave without
telling the villagers.

154
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,730
Give them my regards.

155
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,010
No...

156
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,140
I don't want to!

157
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't go, Captain!

158
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,970
Do you remember this place?

159
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,440
This is where we first met.

160
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,270
All done!

161
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,900
Liar guy!

162
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,570
Who're you guys?!
Don't treat me all buddy-like!

163
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,410
But you're famous!

164
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,320
Yeah, you're a famous person...

165
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,320
I see!

166
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,580
So, people've finally started to
respectfully call me Captain Usopp!

167
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,180
Everyone calls you Liar Usopp!

168
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,590
Alright! From this day forth,
you're members of the Usopp Pirates!

169
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,970
--Eh?!
--Eh?!

170
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,010
Don't give me that!

171
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,830
A lot's happened, huh?

172
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,850
A Cerberus! Scare it away!

173
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,940
A dragon! Capture it!

174
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,140
Flour Star!

175
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,970
You're amazing, Captain!

176
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,740
But of course!
I am a brave warrior of the sea!

177
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,370
We don't wanna hear
about the old days!

178
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,990
Yeah! We don't wanna hear about that!

179
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,160
This isn't like you, Captain!

180
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,120
Why are you saying this stuff now?!

181
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,090
It's almost like you're...

182
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,220
You're so stupid, Captain! Stupid!

183
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,350
What are your ambitions in life?!

184
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,450
To run a pub!

185
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,280
To be a master carpenter!

186
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,440
To be a novel writer!

187
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,730
T-Then swear here that you'll
continue on each of your paths

188
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,980
and never let the fires
of your ambitions go out!

189
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,040
As of today...

190
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,400
...the Usopp Pirates...

191
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,570
...are disbanded!

192
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,760
"Food"

193
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,550
Well, we've eaten.
We should get going now.

194
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,850
Yeah...

195
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,170
Here you are!

196
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,530
Hey, Miss!

197
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,130
Are you alright, being out of bed?

198
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,860
Yes...

199
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,150
My sickness this past year

200
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,240
was caused by the mental dismay
from having lost my parents...

201
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,790
And Usopp-san really
cheered me up, too...

202
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,430
I can't stay coddled forever!

203
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,500
You've done so much for me. Thank you.

204
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,470
I've prepared a present for you
from the bottom of my heart!

205
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,440
Please accept it!

206
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,860
All packed...

207
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,530
Guess it's farewell to this house, too!

208
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,170
Alright...

209
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,920
What?!

210
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,050
What the...? I can't get out!

211
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,690
Darn it!

212
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,920
A caravel!

213
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,330
Can we really have this?!

214
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,420
Yes, please use it!

215
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,800
It's a slightly older model,
but I personally designed it!

216
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,240
A carvel-make caravel, with lateen
sails and a central stern rudder...

217
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,820
...the Going Merry!

218
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,120
Let me explain the running rigging!

219
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,320
First, about the Kruger
net yard adjustment--

220
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,570
No, no! You can explain
the ship stuff to me!

221
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,460
What a good ship!

222
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,920
Especially this front-- it's so cool!

223
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,800
We've loaded it with everything
you might need on a voyage.

224
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,810
Thanks! It leaves nothing to beat tired!

225
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,880
That's "leaves nothing
to be desired," you idiot.

226
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,800
Stop this thing!

227
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,100
Usopp-san!

228
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,950
What's he doing?

229
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,650
Let's just stop him for now.

230
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,940
He's on a collision course with the ship.

231
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,740
T-Thanks...

232
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,030
Sure thing.

233
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,990
So you are taking to
the ocean, Usopp-san?

234
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,390
Yeah. I've decided to get going
before I start to change my mind.

235
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,810
Don't stop me, now.

236
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,590
I won't. I could just tell somehow.

237
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,860
That's kind of sad, too!

238
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,920
The next time I come to this village,

239
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,460
I'll tell you adventure stories that
seem even more lie-like than lies!

240
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,270
Okay! I look forward to it!

241
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,460
You guys take care, too!
Let's meet again sometime!

242
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,640
How come?

243
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,010
Huh? "How come?"

244
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,400
Man, you're antisocial...

245
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,560
I'm gonna be a pirate too, so we'll
meet on the high seas eventually!

246
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,530
What're you talkin' about?
Get on already.

247
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,490
Eh?!

248
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,920
We're friends now, aren't we?

249
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I...

250
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,490
I get to be captain, right?!

251
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,220
Don't be dumb! I'm the captain!

252
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,950
There goes the captain...

253
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,170
Yeah. But he's with those guys,
so I feel less worried now.

254
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,800
Yeah. I've never seen anyone
as strong as them before.

255
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,530
Guess it can't be helped.

256
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,360
He always talked about
how he wanted to be a pirate.

257
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,210
The villagers'll probably be
sad when we tell them, though...

258
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,460
It's all so sudden, plus he
livened things up all by himself...

259
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,670
I just had an idea!

260
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,820
--What is it?!
--What is it?!

261
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,770
They were certainly pleasant people...

262
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,470
Merry...

263
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,460
Yes?

264
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,010
Lying hurts...

265
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,380
Are you referring to Klahadore?

266
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,790
No...

267
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,960
You mean how you really wanted
to stop Usopp-kun from going?

268
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:58,710
Miss, the villagers once told
me a story from his childhood.

269
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,250
Shortly after Usopp-kun's
father left the village,

270
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,260
his mother passed away.

271
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,860
Pirates are here!!

272
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Pirates are here!

273
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,940
Dad's pirates are here!

274
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,070
H-Hold on, Usopp!
You mustn't shout!

275
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,790
Dad came back for us!

276
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,960
D-Don't be silly... Usopp...

277
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,420
But he said he'd take us with
him when you get better, Mom!

278
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,810
Your father won't be coming back...

279
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,650
But... I'm proud I married him...

280
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,860
T-There's a legendary medicine!
It can cure any sickness!

281
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,980
You're so silly... You dream too much...

282
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,850
I don't care if I'm silly! I do dream!

283
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,600
I am the son of a pirate!

284
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,700
Grow up to be a brave
man like your father...

285
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,670
Pirates are here!

286
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,830
Perhaps out of his loneliness,

287
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,930
he continued to shout it out
after his mother's death.

288
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,240
In the hopes that one day his father's
pirate ship would be at the shore,

289
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
in the hopes that one day
he would come back for him...

290
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,240
The villagers say that lie
of his also contains his wish.

291
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,280
Pirates!

292
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,150
As someone who lost his
own parents in this village,

293
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,900
he probably couldn't ignore you,
seeing as the same happened to you.

294
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,480
You will need to grow
stronger now, too!

295
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,790
To live up to everything
he's done until today!

296
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,990
Yes!

297
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,020
Cheers to our new ship and crewmate!

298
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,780
They said they were
fighting to live, not die.

299
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,020
Usopp-san's lies always
spoke about the joy of living.

300
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,620
They cheered me up
and told me to live!

301
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,310
Indeed.

302
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,380
Here we go!

303
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,240
Are we really gonna do this?!

304
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,840
You bet! We're following
in our captain's footsteps!

305
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,800
--Ready...
--Ready...

306
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,250
--Pirates are here!
--Pirates are here!

307
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,980
You know what, Merry?

308
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,570
I'm going to be a doctor!

309
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,970
That's a wonderful goal to have!

310
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

311
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

312
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,020
before someone else could
beat me to it

313
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:52,580
If the world is going to change

314
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:59,590
before I can even attain my dream

315
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:06,660
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

316
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:20,010
so that my memories won't fade

317
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,140
Hey! This island gives me
the creeps! Let's go back!

318
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,740
Treasure-hunting, huh?!
That sounds exciting!

319
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,120
Watch out! There's something here!

320
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,390
What's with this guy?!
He's totally suspicious!

321
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,390
Says he's the protective
god of the island!

322
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,700
Neat! A scrub brush!

323
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,480
