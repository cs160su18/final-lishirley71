00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,010
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,800
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,250
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,390
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,480
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,350
Finger Pistol!

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,240
After all, your ridiculous attacks wouldn't...

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,200
I-I got stuck!

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,780
This is bad!

38
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,690
Sorry, but die in that stupid state, Straw Hat!

39
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,940
Finger Pistol! Spots!

40
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,030
Go back to normal, body!
Hurry! Hurry! I'm gonna be killed!

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,400
The damage I took earlier is affecting my legs!

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,370
Oh? I'm going back...!
I'm going back to normal!

43
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,050
See? My attacks...

44
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,890
...did a number on you after all.

45
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,660
We have to do something...! Or we'll all drown!

46
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,530
When we still haven't really
gotten Robin-chan back yet...!

47
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,700
I can't breathe...! Everything's going dark!

48
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,490
Help!

49
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,450
You'll be fine. Get ahold of yourselves!
I'm not gonna let you die!

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
What?! What's going on?!

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,040
My body is being pulled by something!

52
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,450
Oh... Am I dreaming?

53
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,480
I must be...!

54
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,380
Several sailors are drowning in the sea...

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,490
As their consciousness fades away,
they see an elegant tail fin...

56
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,450
When they look up, they see
long hair swaying in the sea...

57
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,820
She's so beautiful.

58
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the mermaid legend...
It's like we're seeing a fantasy...

59
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,800
If I'm dreaming... please don't let me...

60
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,760
...wake...

61
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,930
I'm gonna go super express!
Make sure you hold your breath tight!

62
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,350
Du...

63
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,270
--Du...
--Du...

64
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,850
Du... A dugong?!

65
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,750
"Cannon Fire Sinks the Island!
Franky's Lamentation"

66
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:13,440
Sorry, marines! We're gonna
use this ship to escape.

67
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,190
Now, we've finished cleaning out our
escape ship, the former escort ship.

68
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,650
Yes.

69
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,490
All we have to do now is wait
for Straw Hat and the others.

70
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,580
What's that?

71
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,420
Don't...

72
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,380
...die!

73
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,840
Battleships 6, 7, and 8 identified
pirates in front of the main gate.

74
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,490
Okay.

75
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,790
Hey, you guys! Wake up!

76
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,040
Hey!

77
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,090
This can only be described as a miracle.

78
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,930
They must've... They must've
received a tremendous shock.

79
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,760
They all stopped breathing,
so they didn't swallow much water.

80
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,900
Good thing they're all okay... but...

81
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,090
...what on earth could have shocked them
enough to make them stop breathing?

82
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,810
It was you.

83
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,080
Hm?

84
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,840
You must be the friend that
pirate king kid came to rescue.

85
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,760
I saw you at the Shift
Station, right? I remember.

86
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,590
Back then...

87
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,820
...I never thought that you guys
would pull something like this.

88
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,420
Put some clothes on, you damn old hag!

89
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,360
I laughed when I heard him say he
was gonna be King of the Pirates...

90
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,570
Our friends are waiting!

91
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,160
Don't stand in our way!

92
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,310
...but who knows? It might actually happen.

93
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,800
Is Nami-san okay?

94
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,840
You guys are as tough as ever.

95
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,130
I'm glad you're alive!

96
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,470
Ahhh! So it was real!
Mermaids really don't exist!

97
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,000
So the tales were true about
people seeing a mermaid

98
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,980
then realizing it was actually a dugong!

99
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,340
You morons! She still hasn't
said she's a mermaid yet!

100
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,570
Don't give up on the dream yet!

101
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,900
I'm an icefish mermaid.

102
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,490
Stop it! Don't say "icefish"!

103
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,950
But I've never heard of a mermaid with legs.

104
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,040
I have an objection, too!

105
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,720
Mermaids should be more...
Mermaids should be more like...

106
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,820
A well-proportioned sexy body...

107
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,420
Smooth white skin and flowing hair
that's beaming and beautiful...!

108
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,020
Stop it!

109
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,960
When mermaids are around 30,
their tail fins fork into two

110
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,670
and they become able to live on land.
They're a mysterious species.

111
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,990
If you go to the Fishman
Island one day, you'll see.

112
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,590
Hm? Fork into two...? Oh, I see!

113
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,470
They say when a cat lives 100 years, its tail
splits into two and it becomes a monster.

114
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,810
Oh, a goblin cat, huh?!

115
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,610
Don't lump me in with monsters!

116
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,480
Couldn't you at least say
thank you for what I did?!

117
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,420
Thank you very much, Kokoro-san!

118
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,410
No problem.

119
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,930
Robin-chaaan!

120
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,430
Huh? Where am I?

121
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,230
Robin!

122
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,430
I'm so glad we made it in time,
Robin! So you're okay!

123
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,170
Robin!

124
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,010
Yes, all thanks to you guys.

125
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,030
Thank you.

126
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,880
Don't worry about it!

127
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,380
Grandma! That's amazing!
So you were a mermaid all this time?!

128
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,690
I was thinking you were different,
since you have fins and scales!

129
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,090
You should've noticed, grandkid!

130
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,200
Chopper?!

131
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,510
Are you okay?

132
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,130
Oh...?

133
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,230
I can't move my body.

134
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,940
It's not surprising. We'll tell you
what happened when this is all over.

135
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,860
Zoro!

136
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,750
Zoro! I mean, Zoro-kun!

137
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,470
Hey, look at that.

138
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,520
It's hard to believe that's the island
we were on up until just a bit ago.

139
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,150
What's with this attack?
It's already a sea of flames!

140
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,620
It seems like they've been ordered
not to kill Nico Robin in their attacks.

141
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,040
So that's why this bridge
isn't being targeted right now.

142
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,110
Their trying not to kill her must mean
they still intend to get her back.

143
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,080
After completely destroying Enies Lobby,

144
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,200
they'll probably engage in some
close combat to get her back.

145
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,560
H-Hey, isn't that bad?
We're all physically wrecked,

146
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,140
and on top of that, there are lots of crazy
powerful guys on those battleships, right?

147
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,600
Where's Luffy right now?

148
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,900
I see the dust of combat still coming up
from the top of this bridge's first column.

149
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,790
His opponent is, of course,
that pigeon guy, Rob Lucci.

150
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,460
It's not far from here! If we give him a hand...

151
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,630
Don't bother.

152
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,000
The pigeon guy is no ordinary man.

153
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,470
What's the point if we get dragged
into the fight and get separated again?

154
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,430
To make sure we still have an escape route

155
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,600
regardless of when that group
of battleships turns this way,

156
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,370
we'll wait for Luffy right here.

157
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,230
That's all we need to do.

158
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
The storm is just beginning.

159
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,040
Understood.

160
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,730
Your legs are being affected after all.

161
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,490
I see. Looks like your ridiculous way
of fighting isn't just playing around.

162
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,960
But don't underestimate the inner
strength of a Six Powers Master.

163
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,920
In order to master the ultimate techniques,

164
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,070
you need the ultimate inner strength!

165
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,880
So what?!

166
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,550
Tempest Kick! Victory Bird!

167
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,540
Franky... your guys are...

168
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,000
You damn idiot!
They've got the luck of the devil!

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,220
They're fine. I'm sure they've escaped okay!

170
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,590
Dammit!

171
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,340
Prepare to fire cannons.

172
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,020
Hm? That's...

173
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,650
Hey, Paulie! Come back!

174
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,740
You're picking up a transponder snail?!
What're you gonna do with that?!

175
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,870
We can find out how the Straw Hats are doing!

176
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,670
Dammit! It's a cannon attack!

177
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,630
Bro!

178
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,490
We can depart anytime!

179
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,450
Once Luffy gets here,
we can set sail right away!

180
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,710
Okay.

181
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,950
But, simply put, there are about as
many battleships as there are of us.

182
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,390
Even if we could set sail, it's virtually
impossible to get through here.

183
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,160
This is a report from the
front gate in the northwest.

184
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,500
We've completed retrieval of
Enies Lobby's marines and officials.

185
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,320
Also, at the front gate,

186
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,820
we identified about fifty pirates,
including the giants, escaping the main island.

187
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,500
Those guys...!

188
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,310
That's Zambai and the others!
See, I told you! They escaped the island okay!

189
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,450
I wasn't worried about them at all!

190
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,850
Really, they wouldn't die
even if you killed them!

191
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,660
The other day, too...

192
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,470
We have finished eliminating them
with a barrage of cannon fire.

193
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,010
All are dead.

194
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,850
Under the circumstances, no one could
possibly survive on the main island.

195
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,600
Hence, the number of survivors on
Enies Lobby's main island is zero!

196
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,980
This is a report from Battleship 2.

197
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,900
The courthouse and the Tower of Law
in the southeast of the island...

198
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,310
...as well as the underground passage
connected to the bridge...

199
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,490
...have all been destroyed.

200
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,500
The only target left to attack
is the Bridge of Hesitation.

201
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,460
Franky...

202
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,040
Those guys have been...

203
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,440
All right, you guys go straight to
the courthouse and join Straw Hat.

204
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,390
We're gonna split into two
and bring the drawbridge down.

205
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,820
Galley-La's shipwrights, too...

206
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,290
When you see... those guys, tell them...

207
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,040
"You guys're fired."

208
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,790
Oimo... Kashii...!

209
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,460
How...

210
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,630
...dare you...

211
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,680
...deceive us?!

212
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,920
I guess Yokozuna was with them, too.

213
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,190
Do you wanna come along?

214
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,060
Ribbit... Ribbit!

215
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,570
Sodom and Gomorrah, too...! They all...

216
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,540
He says, "I'll be faithful to
Big Bro Franky for the rest of my life!"

217
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,150
His pectoral muscle got hurt by a trench mortar!

218
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,680
Move over now before he falls!

219
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,470
No one's gonna be saved
unless you guys move forward!

220
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,390
Is it really okay...

221
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,270
...for people to die so easily like this?

222
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,520
You can't see people on the map.

223
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:08,200
They just erase a small island from the
world map, without a shred of emotion.

224
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,490
That's what Buster Call is.

225
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,800
Bro! We came to rescue you!

226
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,620
Bro! Let's go back together!

227
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,750
Hurry up! Straw Hat!

228
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,310
Your friends are waiting for you here!

229
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,770
Don't you dare die on us!

230
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,660
Franky...

231
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,770
This will be the last time!

232
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,690
Until I bring you down, I won't stop it.

233
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,570
Are you gonna try to use up
all your power and die?

234
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,310
I don't know what's gonna happen.

235
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,950
Second... Gear!

236
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,720
Two hundred Captains
from Navy Headquarters?!

237
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,980
Just how many strong guys
do they have to send in?!

238
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,010
That proves just how scared they are of us.

239
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,970
Listen up! Hold strong until Luffy comes!

240
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,890
We'll all make it through this
and leave this place!

241
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

242
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,150
"Wait for Luffy! Mortal Combat
on the Bridge of Hesitation!"

243
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,200
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
