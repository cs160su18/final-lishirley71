2
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,420
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,720
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,930
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,320
the Straw Hats finally entered the New
World, the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

11
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,030
After landing on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen,

12
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,280
they learned about the hideous experiments
performed by Caesar Clown, the Master,

13
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,860
and headed off to investigate
but as things got going,

14
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,290
they came to form an alliance with the
Heart Pirates led by Trafalgar Law.

15
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,670
And Luffy finally encountered Caesar!

16
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,970
You shouldn't underestimate me.

17
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,100
Who is there?!

18
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,920
Why are you...

19
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,280
...here?!

20
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,260
It's been years.

21
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,570
You've grown up.

22
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,620
Law.

23
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,700
"A Samurai Who Can Cut
Fire! Foxfire Kin'emon!"

24
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,040
Do you really think that he had no idea?

25
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,400
We don't trust Caesar, either.

26
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,720
That's why he was being careful
and sent an undercover agent.

27
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,270
Monet is that agent.

28
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,050
You're a Warlord-sama now, aren't you?

29
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,410
You've done so well.

30
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,440
When did you come here?

31
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,520
Vergo!

32
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,670
Just arrived. Luckily, I was at Dressrosa.

33
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,490
I got a ride in an SAD tanker
that was about to leave.

34
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,820
It was the right move.

35
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,160
The right move?!

36
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Did I cause any harm to you guys?!

37
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,260
No but if you did, you'd be dead by now.

38
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,640
You can't fool grown-ups, Law.

39
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,130
In that case, I should just finish you!

40
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,850
Oh, I forgot to mention.

41
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,910
You've got to say it properly.

42
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,470
It's Vergo-san to you.

43
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,010
IN FRONT OF THE LABORATORY LUFFY'S GROUP

44
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,360
What just happened?

45
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,800
I have no idea.

46
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,360
What should we do?

47
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,430
Tashigi-chan!

48
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,830
It's Vice Admiral Smoker!

49
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,090
I can't believe I saw him
get taken down twice a day.

50
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,740
Three of the Straw Hats got beaten, too!

51
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,240
Was it Conqueror's Haki?!

52
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,660
No way! There can't be that much
difference in their strength!

53
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,060
Then what was it?! He beat all of
them without even touching them!

54
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
That serves you right, Navy!

55
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,990
That was what our savior
- Master is capable of!

56
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,430
Master! Master! Master! Master!

57
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,760
Master! Master! Master!

58
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,230
My strong soldiers!

59
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,840
Tie these five up!

60
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,140
Use Sea Prism Stone chains
for the Devil Fruit eaters!

61
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,740
Leave the Navy soldiers here
and get inside the laboratory.

62
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,510
It's dangerous out here.

63
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,340
Something strange is raining
down but don't worry.

64
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,070
I'll protect this place where you belong!

65
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,070
Yes, Master!

66
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,730
Looks like the Cool Brothers blew it.

67
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,420
But it can't be helped.

68
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,090
Fighting against Straw Hat and Law
must've been too much for them.

69
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,130
THE MIDDLE LAKE - ZORO'S GROUP

70
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,030
Gross!

71
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,850
Alright, Brook. Convince them.

72
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,820
That's impossible!

73
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,950
What kind of negotiation skill is
going to work for these monsters?!

74
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,540
They're merging into one another!

75
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,750
Boy, they're merging into one
another and getting bigger.

76
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,190
I-I-It got bigger!

77
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,980
Do I have a choice? It's my personal mission!

78
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,070
I'm Sanji, I'm a man! I've got to do it!

79
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,610
Sanji-san!

80
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,570
Do something about the Slimes behind you.

81
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,620
Please be careful!

82
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,670
What a pain in the ass! That worthless chef!

83
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,760
Oh, it's coming!

84
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,500
Don't... Don't... Don't attack me!

85
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,160
It's big, it's big!

86
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,020
Oh no, you better not do that!

87
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,310
Whoa, don't! Help me!

88
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,960
You did it!

89
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,560
I knew you could do it, Zoro-san!

90
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,270
It's gas! Run!

91
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,520
I've had enough!

92
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,900
I-I-It's poison gas!

93
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,870
My eyes, my eyes!

94
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,910
Oh, I don't have eyes.

95
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,500
Hey, what's your problem?!

96
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,790
You jelly-ish body entity!

97
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,710
Poison gas, again!

98
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,020
What should we do, Zoro-san?!
It's poison gas!

99
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,290
I did the same thing before!

100
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,950
Learn from observation, skeleton!

101
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,170
I thought you were just unlucky.

102
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,950
We're surrounded.

103
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,540
This is not good.

104
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,690
It's cold!

105
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,760
Where is the samurai's torso?

106
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,780
Alright. Let's use it!

107
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,520
Observation Haki!

108
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,200
We have nowhere to go now!

109
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,640
Oh yeah, they're jellies!

110
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
Why don't you eat and digest them?

111
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,010
No way!

112
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,200
Could you stop talking to me like a bully?!

113
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,660
I'm like 70 years older than you!

114
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,210
I'm sorry, grandpa!

115
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,630
Who did you call "grandpa"?!

116
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,850
I'm still a lively skeleton...

117
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,680
What's the matter?!

118
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,430
Samurai-san?! T-T-Take it easy!

119
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,140
So cold!

120
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,640
Sorry, Nami-san.

121
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,460
Could this be the Slime's toxin?!

122
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,490
Whoa-whoa, I hope his torso
is not engulfed by it!

123
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,400
I've been using Observation
Haki for quite a while

124
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,280
but maybe the torso's getting weaker.

125
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,910
I can't distinguish its life
force from that of the fish!

126
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,590
A shark?

127
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,680
No way!

128
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,520
A-Are you alright?

129
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,110
Hey, what's the matter?! What's going on?!

130
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,740
Wait, you shithead! Don't mess with me!

131
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,920
Stop chewing on it, shark!

132
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,300
I-I-It doesn't hurt at all! It itches!

133
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,880
What's wrong with him?!

134
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,810
Is he bluffing?

135
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,480
That hurts... Not really!

136
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,270
Maybe something happened to Sanji-san?!

137
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,860
You fool, let it go!

138
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,320
Now!

139
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,160
Joue Shoot!

140
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,950
Alright, I got the last piece safely!

141
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,090
The samurai puzzle will be complete!

142
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,420
I gotta go back now!

143
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,540
It's gonna close up!

144
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,180
Dammit!

145
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,940
The poison got this far!

146
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,370
Shit! It's all around me now!

147
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,660
Can I do it with Nami-san's strength?

148
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,520
It's gonna put a strain on her body again...

149
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,880
This is not good!

150
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,610
The whole lake is turning
to the color of the poison!

151
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,220
Sanji-san, hurry up!

152
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,600
Blue Walk!

153
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,890
Don't close up! Don't
close up! Don't close up!

154
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,270
Don't close up!

155
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,070
Sanji-san!

156
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,190
Oh, he got it!

157
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,880
He really did it!

158
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,180
What can I say?!

159
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,100
I have never felt so happy
to just have my own body!

160
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,570
THE SAMURAI FROM THE WANO
KINGDOM FOXFIRE KIN'EMON

161
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,820
Oh, I didn't know you were so tall!

162
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,690
You're as tall as I am.

163
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,990
Oh yes! Excuse me for not
introducing myself sooner!

164
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,620
My name is Kin'emon!

165
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,170
I was born in Kuri, Wano Kingdom!

166
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,500
Just do it already! I'm
gonna freeze to death!

167
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,880
Yes! I'm sorry!

168
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,630
Poof!

169
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,120
It's still cold.

170
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,050
The coat will disappear once
he takes it off, right?

171
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,150
Funny-eyebrow man, what is
your honorable name, sir?

172
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm Sanji!

173
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,390
Cut the "sir" crap!

174
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,700
Now you have your whole body back
so you've changed your attitude!

175
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,730
But you were insulting me so much earlier

176
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,160
hiding behind the fact you were disabled!

177
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,170
I hope you're not forgetting what you said!

178
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,170
You people are pirates?!

179
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,980
No wonder you people are barbaric!

180
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,260
I don't like pirates! You make me sick!

181
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,650
Don't irritate me!

182
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,640
Why don't you just ask me to find your body?!

183
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,510
I don't wanna owe anything to pirates!

184
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,070
I wouldn't ask you even if it kills me!

185
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,480
Now, I'm not even capable of
fighting back if someone hits me

186
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,910
so you can carry me if you want to.

187
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,100
I will never forget!

188
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,630
Ever!

189
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,670
I will never forget your kindness
for the rest of my life!

190
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,970
I appreciate everything!

191
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,980
And please forgive me for
having doubts about you all...

192
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,200
...until I got my torso back!

193
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,990
I'm begging you! I'm begging you!

194
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,980
I'm begging you!

195
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,410
I'm begging you...

196
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,070
Stop it, fool! Lift your head up!

197
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,540
Men shouldn't kneel on
the ground that easily!

198
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,910
But if you, sir, weren't there, I probably...

199
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,630
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt
you but, Sanji-san...

200
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,460
Looks like we're in big trouble.

201
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,300
Look. You see?

202
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,190
THE THIRD LABORATORY

203
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,280
The drug...

204
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,900
If only I could find out
how he made the drug...

205
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,410
Is that...

206
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,780
Great! It's a book about drugs!

207
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,030
Now I gotta look for sedatives.

208
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,430
Master, the airship is ready.

209
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,520
Okay.

210
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,330
Then let's go pick them up.

211
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,360
It's about time for them to have these.

212
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,660
Put Straw Hat and the others in a
cage and carry it to my chambers.

213
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,460
Yes, Master!

214
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,370
We have nowhere to run now!

215
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,260
Hey, guys! Didn't I tell you
to do something about them?!

216
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,070
It can't be helped because
we couldn't do anything.

217
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,800
That's right.

218
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,420
Don't be such children, you idiots!

219
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,880
I can't cause any damage to Nami-san's body!

220
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,490
This body...

221
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,170
Th-This body, I have to...

222
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,760
You're not gonna return it, are you?

223
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,440
Of course not!

224
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Why don't we burn them down?

225
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,740
What?

226
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,240
People call me Foxfire Kin'emon.

227
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,350
I can burn and slice an enemy with my sword.

228
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,750
Let me burn them down and
clear the way to escape!

229
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,120
You can burn and slice an enemy?

230
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,010
It sounds like magic!

231
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,640
He cut the fire!

232
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,360
Now I cleared the way.

233
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,380
I'm coming for you, Momonosuke!

234
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,100
Huh?! I'm still alive!

235
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,610
I thought we were engulfed by
the fire from the explosion!

236
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,540
K-K-Kin'emon-san? What just happened?

237
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,460
I just cut the explosion.

238
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,410
The explosion?!

239
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,230
My Foxfire Style

240
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,300
allows me to cut something
with fire and then cut flames.

241
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,110
There is no flame that I can't cut!

242
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,930
Now I'm going to go to the
laboratory to save Momonosuke!

243
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,870
If you'll excuse me!

244
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,870
Wait!

245
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,700
I'm intrigued by a samurai's fight.

246
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,570
I'll go with you to rescue your son!

247
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,630
A mysterious man suddenly appears
and hurts Law with his immense power.

248
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,840
His identity causes quite the shock,

249
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,510
and the identity of the powerful
enemy that stands behind

250
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,060
Caesar and the mysterious
man finally comes to light!

251
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

252
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,730
"Shocking! The True Identity
of the Mystery Man Vergo!"

253
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,890
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
