2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,660
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,050
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,770
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,970
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,750
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,340
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,730
What's the terrifying
difference between you and me?

25
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,950
Nose.

26
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,680
Jaw?

27
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,180
Webs!

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,340
Species!!

29
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,770
Such a fool! He hurt
himself by biting on a rock!

30
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,040
Now his teeth're brok...

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,080
He crushed the stone
pillar with his teeth!!

32
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,450
Ahh! That's scary!

33
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,550
"Explosion! Fishman Arlong's
Fierce Assault From the Sea!"

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,660
Did you see...

35
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,510
...the inherent power of a fishman?

36
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,870
Heaven created you humans as
creatures that bow before fishmen.

37
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,960
You humans are inferior creatures.

38
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,620
We were on a different level
from the moment we were born.

39
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,260
I'll show you... the real
difference between you and me...

40
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah, why don't you?

41
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,330
No way I'll lose
against someone like you.

42
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,300
I am the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

43
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,460
King of the Pirates?

44
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,440
Don't make me laugh.

45
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,410
Can you inferior humans do something

46
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,800
like crush a pillar with your teeth?

47
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,340
It's true that humans can't crush
that thick pillar using their teeth.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,770
If that jaw gets you,

49
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,560
it won't just give you bite marks...

50
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,510
It'll bite clear through your bones!

51
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,190
So what?!

52
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,310
Stop...

53
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,950
...bragging over stuff like that!!

54
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,220
It's not like biting is the
only way to break stone.

55
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,210
All right, Big Bro Luffy!
You sure told him!

56
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,180
That's right!
The outcome is the same!

57
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,580
Th-That's besides the point!

58
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,680
A stupid and weak species...
That's what humans are.

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,190
What can you do when you can't
even pull yourself out of the water?!

60
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,900
Nothing! That's why I need help!

61
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,600
Hm? He can also use swords?

62
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,720
Take that... and that... and that!

63
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,970
What're you doing?

64
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,180
It looks like you're just
swinging swords around.

65
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,590
If you're just playing around,
I'm not going to join your little game.

66
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,150
Enough of this nonsense...

67
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,000
Clench your teeth!!

68
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,180
Wha?! He shattered
Arlong's teeth!!

69
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,700
I don't know how to use
swords, you bastard!!

70
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,150
Huh? What's he saying that now for?

71
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,790
I don't know how to sail the oceans.

72
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,320
I can't cook...

73
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,970
I can't lie, either...

74
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,160
Hey...

75
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,020
I'm confident that
I can't live without help!

76
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,270
Fully admitting how pathetic you are...

77
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,720
You sure are honest.

78
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,000
I bet your crew is bothered by having

79
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,770
such an incompetent captain like you.

80
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,480
I wonder why your crew tried
so desperately to save you...

81
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,530
Someone like you without any pride
has the caliber to be a captain?

82
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,170
What on earth can you do?

83
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,710
I can defeat you!

84
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,970
Of course, you damn idiot!

85
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,720
If he dies, I'm gonna kill him!

86
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,630
I've got your back!

87
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,320
All right, Gum-Gum!!

88
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Get him, Big Bro Luffy!

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,640
Go for it by a hair!

90
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,590
Go ahead and babble,
you inferior species!

91
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,290
Ugh! He's got new teeth!

92
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,330
I'm a shark. New teeth
grow one after another.

93
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,770
And they're stronger
than the previous ones.

94
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,260
As many times as needed...

95
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,160
Whoa!

96
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,900
As many times...

97
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,980
This is a distinctive
quality that heaven gave us.

98
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,230
Amazing!!

99
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,180
Are you starting to realize what a
superior species the fishmen are?

100
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,610
Tooth Attack!

101
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,960
Huh?

102
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,910
Stop!

103
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,680
Big Bro Luffy!!

104
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,230
A-Arlong-san...

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,070
That hurt...

106
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,310
Wha! B-Brother!

107
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,770
Phew...

108
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,080
You damn rubber man!

109
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,770
How dare you use
my brother as a shield!

110
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,260
What're you saying?
You're the one who attacked me.

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,220
Phew... Was I scared...

112
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,180
Don't move...

113
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,960
...you damn rubber man!

114
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,590
Oh, yeah! I've got an interesting idea.

115
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,200
An interesting idea?

116
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,300
What on earth will he...?

117
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,060
Did he come up with a
secret scheme or something?

118
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,350
Tooth Attack!

119
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,040
There we go!

120
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,290
You...

121
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,440
There's no point in crushing
my teeth repeatedly...

122
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,030
You still don't get it?!

123
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,830
B-Big Bro Luffy...

124
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,490
You surely don't mean
your interesting idea is...

125
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,300
Look! I've got fangs, too!

126
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,240
S... So there wasn't any secret scheme?

127
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,890
I thought as much...

128
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,820
How long are you going to...

129
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,840
...keep fooling around?!

130
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,690
I got bitten by a shark!!

131
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,530
That's because
you're playing around!!

132
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,990
It's not like I'm playing around.

133
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,920
Tooth Attack!

134
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,070
He got bit!!

135
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,560
How do you like your own teeth?!

136
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,640
Even if it's my teeth that you used,

137
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,580
it's your weak jaw after all.

138
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,170
Listen up.

139
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,550
Shark teeth become useful
when they come with a strong jaw

140
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,770
that can bite off the meat!

141
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,800
Ahh!! Big Bro's arm's
gonna get bitten off!!

142
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,040
Luffy!!

143
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,710
Is his arm okay?

144
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,000
If he backed off even a step,
it would've been bitten off!

145
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,100
In his case, it's not that he thought
about how animal's fangs work, though.

146
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,810
Is Big Bro's arm okay?

147
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,150
Oh...?

148
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,420
Where'd he go?

149
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,800
Luffy! The sea!

150
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,710
The sea?

151
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,660
There's a shark!

152
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,870
That's Arlong!

153
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,180
Huh? Did he dive in?

154
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,080
This isn't good!
His ability doubles in the water.

155
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,340
No one can stop me once my
speed accelerates in the water.

156
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,220
This is precisely an ability
that is given only to fishmen.

157
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,520
Did he run away?

158
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,600
Shark... Darts!!

159
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,150
What was that?!

160
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,000
A torpedo?!

161
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,080
Something flew out from the sea!

162
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,610
Ow... Ow, ow, ow, ow...

163
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,010
Wow, I'm impressed you dodged it.

164
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,590
But the more you dodge it,
the longer your hell continues.

165
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,760
Shark... Darts!!

166
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,940
Wha...! What kind of bones
does that damn shark have?!

167
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,410
His nose crushed the ground...!

168
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,180
Shark... Darts!!

169
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,630
Hey, Luffy, hide!
Arlong went into the sea again!

170
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,980
Big Bro! Please hurry up and hide!

171
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,050
He'll target you again!

172
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,070
Get out of there!!

173
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,940
N... No...

174
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,070
Don't be stupid! Are you knowingly
going to become a target?! Hide!

175
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,740
I don't want to!
I'll catch him and break his nose!

176
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,200
Come on! Shark!

177
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,410
You've got some nerve.

178
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,200
Or have you realized that
it's useless to run away?

179
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,820
Didn't you hear us saying
you should hide, Luffy?!

180
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,870
You barely dodged his attacks
and they all grazed you!

181
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,670
If you take a direct hit,
you'll die instantly!!

182
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:41,680
Gum-Gum... Shield!!

183
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,640
What's that position?

184
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,660
Surely he isn't going to
stop the attack like that?

185
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,310
This is double the acceleration
distance from earlier.

186
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,810
I'll pierce your heart!

187
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,370
Shark Darts!!

188
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,190
He got hit!!

189
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,890
What?! Did he get hit?!

190
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,850
No! He flung himself off!

191
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,620
You lose.
That attack won't work any more.

192
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,990
Shark Darts!!

193
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,750
You bastard!
That was by instinct, wasn't it?!

194
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,090
This is the final blow!

195
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,180
You won't hit me!

196
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,930
Gum-Gum... Finger Net!!

197
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,000
Fishing! Fishing!

198
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,310
And...!

199
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,390
Spear!!

200
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,230
Whoa!!

201
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,090
Hm...? Did he die?

202
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,850
The look in Arlong's eyes changed!

203
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,420
They look the same as the eyes
that Sea Kings show when they snap.

204
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,350
He must've snapped
with Luffy's last attack!

205
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,310
I've never seen
Arlong's eyes like that...

206
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,760
You inferior human!

207
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,470
What did you do...

208
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,420
...to me, a fishman?!

209
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,250
Boy, was I stunned!

210
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,230
It doesn't hurt, but I can
see he's really mad.

211
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,350
What the heck is that?

212
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,030
Shark Saw!!

213
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,230
It's a giant saw!!

214
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,870
Big Bro Luffy!!

215
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,330
Hang in there, Luffy!

216
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,290
Run!! Watch out!!

217
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,290
The attack won't stop...
He's getting cornered...!

218
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,850
He escaped into the building!

219
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,520
The left window on the top floor...

220
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,350
That room is...

221
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,730
That was close...

222
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,910
You can no longer escape.

223
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,680
This is the top floor of Arlong Park.

224
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,610
Looks like your final
moment is finally here.

225
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,300
What's this room?

226
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,520
Full of papers...

227
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,790
These're not just ordinary papers.

228
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,990
This is a room where I make that
woman continue to draw sea charts.

229
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,860
The survey room!!

230
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,770
Nami's room...

231
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,560
These're all sea charts that Nami drew.

232
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,000
Aren't they great?

233
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,030
They're my treasure, one that I
made her draw for eight years.

234
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,160
To us, getting data about
the oceans is very simple,

235
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,840
but it's a different story when we
have to create sea charts based on it.

236
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,880
We need a talented surveyor.

237
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,370
That's why I had my eye on that woman.

238
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,660
She's good. She draws
quite accurate sea charts.

239
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,860
She's too good for
you inferior humans.

240
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,030
In the past as well as in the future,

241
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,810
her talent should be
used for us fishmen!

242
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,450
Hm?

243
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,200
Nami is our friend.

244
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,840
Friend?

245
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,570
So don't interfere any more...

246
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,040
...you damn rubber man!

247
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,500
What's that look in your eyes?!

248
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,080
She is...

249
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,650
Nami is...

250
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,560
Hm?

251
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,560
...our navigator!!

252
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

253
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

254
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

255
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

256
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

257
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

258
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

259
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

260
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

261
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

262
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

263
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,310
Amazing! What a fierce battle this is!

264
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,650
I finally figured out how to save her!

265
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,650
Show us your determination,
you damn rubber man!

266
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,320
I'll completely destroy the room
that she wants to be free of!

267
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,650
Go! Get Arlong!

268
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,320
Luffy... Thank you...

269
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,530
On the next episode of One Piece!

270
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,160
"End of the Fishmen Empire!
Nami's My Friend!"

271
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,510
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
