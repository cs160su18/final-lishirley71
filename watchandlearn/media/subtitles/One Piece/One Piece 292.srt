2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,670
"A Big Rice Cake Tossing Race
at the Castle! Red Nose's Plot"

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,580
A joyous new year has arrived
in the country of Grand Jipang.

27
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,340
Well, what a blessing that is.

28
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,710
We wrapped up the restless days at the end
of the last year. Why don't we take it easy?

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,920
The new year has just started.

30
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,770
What's going on?

31
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,580
I just said we should take it easy,
and now things already seem restless!

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,340
Who the heck is causing it?!

33
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,340
Outta our way! Outta our way!
Outta our way! Make way for us!

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,720
Well, you don't have to
shout like that, Onami-san.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,310
Huh?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,980
There's no one around here.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,690
Oh... you're right.

38
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,100
The sun is already high, and yet
this town is like a ghost town.

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,510
I wonder if everyone's still in bed.

40
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,390
Oh, come on, Doctor, wake up!

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,070
They've already gone to the castle.

42
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,630
In any event, today is the day they
hold Grand Jipang's popular event,

43
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,140
the New Year's Big Rice Cake Tossing!

44
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,850
If you were a resident of this town,
you'd rush straight to the castle.

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,590
Oh? Is that right?

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,790
Anyway, it's a rice cake tossing event.
They can't start it without rice cakes.

47
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:32,730
"Purveying to the Castle"

48
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,540
It can affect our business reputation, too.
Please rush to the castle!

49
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,600
Okay!

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,990
But don't they usually do the rice
cake tossing at temples and shrines?

51
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,550
Here, our lord tosses them at the castle.

52
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,810
Every year the scramble for them is
so crazy that there are even casualties.

53
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,200
What?!

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,740
Oh, he's just joking, Doctor.
There're no casualties.

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,080
But when it comes to that Boss
Straw Hat, he might go that far.

56
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,420
I wonder if someone's talking about me.

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,700
Setting aside Boss, I didn't know that
people in this town were so gluttonous.

58
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,220
It's not like that, Doctor.

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,680
What they're after are not regular
rice cakes, but a jackpot rice cake.

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,130
Huh? Jackpot?

61
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,090
That's right.

62
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,880
Tens of thousands of rice cakes will be
tossed from the top of the castle tower.

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,650
And among them is a single jackpot rice cake.

64
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,510
In this rice cake, there's a
treasure called a diamond.

65
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,110
And believe it or not, it's worth
more than 10 million Ryo-Berries!

66
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,620
That sure is magnificent, don't you think?

67
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,670
I'd definitely like to get it.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,550
"New Year
Big Rice Cake Tossing Event Held Here"

69
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,140
But how do I figure out
which one contains the jackpot?

70
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,030
Beats me. I've never seen one before, so...

71
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,010
Hey, do you know?!

72
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,470
Ah... No, I don't.

73
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,970
In any case, I think you just have to grab

74
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,530
whatever you can lay your hands on
and break them to see inside.

75
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,310
It kind of sounds like a wild goose chase.

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,440
If I get the jackpot one, I'll buy lots of books!

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,530
I wanna take a trip to a health spa
with everyone at the row house.

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,050
Hey! You're open for business
already this morning?

79
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,480
Yes. Since today is the 7th, I'm selling rice
porridge mixed with seven spring herbs.

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,300
Would you like a bowl, too?

81
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,840
Yeah, sounds good.

82
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,800
Hey, Usopp! It's not fair that you're
eating by yourself! I'll have some, too!

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,920
You can't, Boss! You have to
stay there and stand watch!

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,600
This is rice porridge, so I can't
throw it to you. So just give up!

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,060
Whoa! Wh-Wh-What the hell is this?!

86
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,770
All right, here it comes! Thanks!

87
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,440
Boss! Once you finish eating it, please go
to the front and stand watch, okay?!

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,980
Geez...

89
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,580
Your duty must be tough.

90
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,500
Well, the jackpot is worth
10 million Ryo-Berries, right?

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,040
Someone blinded by greed
could be up to no good, so...

92
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,460
Sitting around and waiting for the jackpot
when you don't know where it's gonna fall

93
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,830
is just a pain in the neck! I can't do that!

94
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,970
There's a way to get it for sure.

95
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,390
In short...

96
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,720
...we'll get all the rice cakes
before they toss them at the castle.

97
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,980
Then, we'll get the jackpot one
for sure. Yeah, that's my plan!

98
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,110
You're right!

99
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,400
Men! Get them flashily!

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,650
There's nowhere to escape on the bridge!

101
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,040
Geez... When we're almost to the castle...

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,000
We don't have time to turn back, guys!

103
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,920
Let's go, Doctor!

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,630
Yeah!

105
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,510
That was close!

106
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,390
Not bad.

107
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,390
Onami...

108
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,310
That was cruel.

109
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,110
Take this, too!

110
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,480
Doctor! Watch your back!

111
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,280
Mellorine! Mellorine!

112
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,240
Richie!

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,660
You son of a bitch!

114
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,460
Stop, you bastards!

115
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,670
If you don't wanna die,
leave all the stuff on the cart here!

116
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,840
Boss! They got away!

117
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,500
It's not gonna work anymore!

118
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,990
They'll enter the castle
before we catch up with them!

119
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,010
Don't be ridiculous! It's 10 million
Ryo-Berries we're talking about!

120
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,670
I'm not gonna give up!

121
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,670
But...

122
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,400
...I'm not gonna let them get away...

123
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,980
...as I've already prepared my next move.

124
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,900
If you get it, come back
up already and get ready!

125
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,010
Yes, sir!

126
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,930
Father.

127
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,430
Looks like it's getting lively down there.

128
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,270
Yes. They seem like they can't wait.

129
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,990
Yeah... By the way, looks like we still
haven't received the rice cakes yet.

130
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,190
Right...

131
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,990
I'm having someone stand watch,
but I haven't received any report yet.

132
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,290
I'm a little worried that something
might've happened on their way here.

133
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh, that's right.

134
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,510
You know the people we're
getting the rice cakes from well.

135
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,960
I wonder if we should send someone for them.

136
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,610
Ahh... Since she said, "We don't
need guards, so pay us generously instead,"

137
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,970
I didn't send any guards. I hope
Onami-san and the others are okay.

138
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,300
Hm? There they are!

139
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,690
What took Onami so long? Rice cakes
taste better right after they're made.

140
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,000
Hm?

141
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,190
What's that kite doing?!

142
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,860
Hey! What's going on?!

143
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,390
Whoa! We're floating in the air!

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,940
Hold on tight!

145
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,320
They're waiting in ambush again?!

146
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,700
Those bastards!

147
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,190
Who are you?! Actually, you're from
the Buggy Family, aren't you?!

148
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,570
You're left... I mean, you're right!

149
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,130
By order of Boss Buggy,
I came to take all the rice cakes.

150
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,090
My name is Hachi. Nice to meet you.

151
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,850
"And there's one more person right here!"

152
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,850
"I, the martial artist Gedatsu
of the Buggy Family!!"

153
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:51,380
Well, don't worry. Once I get the
rice cakes, I won't even touch you guys.

154
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,340
I'll make sure to put you
back on the ground safely.

155
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,840
Don't be ridiculous!

156
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,030
If we can't deliver them after coming this far,

157
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,640
our business reputation will be
totally ruined! Do something, Sanji-kun!

158
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,540
Well, I can't do anything like this.

159
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,150
--Argh!
--Ahh! Help!

160
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,540
Hey, hey. Don't move around.
Don't blame me if you fall.

161
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,340
You rice cake thief! Surrender peacefully!

162
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,090
Gum-Gum...

163
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,140
Idiot! Don't cling to me!

164
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,120
Hmm... Why am I falling too?

165
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:46,080
Oh, that's right! I should've let the
kite string go! How careless of me!

166
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,910
--Ow, ow, ow...
--Well, we're okay now.

167
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,800
No, we aren't! The cart is...!

168
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,220
Those guys...!

169
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,680
Look at that, guys! The rice
cakes are coming our way!

170
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,290
The jackpot's gonna be mine!

171
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,590
Igaram-san!

172
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,850
Chaka! Pell! Get the cart!

173
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,780
Yes, sir!

174
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,120
How dare you get in my way?!

175
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,870
It doesn't matter who they are!
Take them down!

176
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,580
What're you guys doing?!

177
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,840
But, Boss... We're carrying
this heavy stuff on a slope.

178
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,880
Let's take a little break.

179
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,750
Stop whining! Just go after them!

180
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,840
Onami-dono!

181
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,060
Are you okay?

182
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,880
Yes! Well then, we certainly
delivered what you ordered.

183
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes. Thank you.

184
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,030
What about the payment?
I can get it right here and now, right?

185
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,450
The task was more dangerous than we thought.

186
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,780
Oh, about that...

187
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,370
Hey... This is business with the castle.
You can't put it on a tab.

188
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,200
Princess Vivi said that she
herself will bring it to your place.

189
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,630
So wait until then.

190
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
Well then, goodbye.

191
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,120
Tell Vivi to stop by any time!

192
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,430
They still haven't given up yet?!

193
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,090
Don't worry about them, Sanji-kun!
Let's go to the event site.

194
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,350
Just leave the rest to the
castle people. It'll be fine.

195
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,910
Hey, Boss! If it turns out that they can't
do the rice cake tossing or something,

196
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,320
you'll be forbidden to come to our eatery!

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
So work hard, got that?!

198
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,810
Yeah...

199
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,490
Boss! They're already going into the castle!

200
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,820
Shut up! It doesn't matter!
We'll force our way through!

201
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,890
We'll do it flashily!

202
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,410
They've started the rice
cake tossing? I got a late start!

203
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,110
Intruders!

204
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,380
Don't let them get away!

205
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,280
It's the Buggy Family!

206
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
They're after these rice cakes!

207
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,170
Got it. Please hurry!

208
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,890
Hey! Where's the event site?

209
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,390
Hm? Oh, it's you!

210
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,600
Good timing! Give us a hand.

211
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,930
--Huh?
--A rice cake thief showed up!

212
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,270
I heard that he's going
on a rampage in the castle!

213
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,020
What?! I've been looking forward to
those rice cakes! Where's the thief?!

214
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,740
--Over there!
--All right!

215
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,960
Trying to get them all
to himself?! How despicable!

216
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,390
Those rice cakes are mine!

217
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,620
What? Hey, hey... You too?

218
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,000
Rice cake thief! I'm gonna
capture you at any cost!

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Where are the rice cakes?!

220
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,140
We're not gonna let him
destroy the castle any more!

221
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,810
Well, I have an idea as to where he's headed.

222
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,100
I know a short cut. Leave it to me!
Let's catch up with them quickly, Mr. Monk!

223
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,810
Hey, Usopp. Who have you
been talking to all this time?

224
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,580
Hm? Oh, Boss! Who've I
been talking to? Of course...

225
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,320
Huh?! He's gone! When did that happen?

226
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,260
Anyway, I'm going on ahead, okay?

227
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,690
At any rate, that monk
isn't reliable. Where did he go?

228
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,050
Where are the rice cakes?!

229
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,990
Ahhh!

230
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,470
H-H-Hey...

231
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,220
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

232
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,500
Amazon-dono! Are you okay?!

233
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,480
Someone!

234
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,060
What's going on?!

235
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,020
A deviant is in here!

236
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,780
How rude!

237
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,010
What did I do?!

238
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,250
Hold it!

239
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,550
All right! Just go ahead and charge in!

240
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,510
Boss!

241
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,220
It's all over for you, Buggy Family!

242
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,550
I won't allow any more violence in the castle!

243
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,810
Be prepared!

244
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,780
Oh, my, my... Princess.

245
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,900
Thank you very much for greeting me yourself!

246
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,640
You don't know the Chop-Chop Fruit's powers?

247
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,450
This is your own fault for butting in.

248
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,080
Oh, don't get me wrong.

249
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,670
I didn't come here for her. I came
here to get the jackpot rice cake!

250
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,960
Bring the rice cake cart here right away!

251
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll exchange her for the cart. Move it already!

252
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,600
Don't blame me if the
princess's neck gets broken!

253
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,720
Wait! We get it.

254
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,480
We have no choice but to do what he says.

255
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,810
Oh? So a lackey realizes the situation
faster than the samurais, huh? Okay, then!

256
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,630
You go and bring the cart here.

257
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,360
Well, the jackpot rice cake isn't on that cart.

258
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,190
Then, where is it?

259
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,450
The jackpot rice cake is...

260
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,320
Don't!

261
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,030
...with our lord!

262
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,850
Oh...?

263
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,080
Is that right?

264
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,500
It's over there.

265
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,120
What?! I-Is it okay to take it so easily? Huh?

266
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,990
That's fine.

267
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,820
I-I-It...

268
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,350
It's empty!

269
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,910
Oh? So that's where big nose was?

270
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,980
You son of a bitch! You flashily deceived me!

271
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,780
Yep.

272
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,490
Buggy, was it? Look outside
the window. On the ground are...

273
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,620
Hey! Don't break the castle!

274
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,210
Hey, big nose! We're not gonna let
you have the jackpot, you bastard!

275
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,090
Like I said, it's empty!
I'm gonna beat you till you cry!

276
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,750
Well, listen. On the ground
are this town's residents

277
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,780
who have been looking forward
to this rice cake tossing event.

278
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,000
This event is held for them so that
they can start the new year cheerfully.

279
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,550
This is a gathering in which
they try their luck, so to speak.

280
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,060
It all depends on your luck
whether you get a prize or not,

281
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,920
but the chance of winning
should be equal for everyone.

282
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,490
So I can't give it to you alone now.

283
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,330
If you want the prize, then go down there

284
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,750
and wait with everyone for
the rice cake tossing to start.

285
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,360
Just as we'd expect from you, my lord.
Splendid persuasion. I'm impressed.

286
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,920
Yep.

287
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,760
Say, my lord. Let's start it already.

288
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,720
If we don't hurry up, Onami is gonna beat me.

289
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,600
Hey! You're being rude! To think
that you speak to our lord that way!

290
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,020
I give up!

291
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,770
I won't need such a small thing!
How dare you mock me?!

292
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,490
I found something better, my lord.

293
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,520
Forget the 10 million Ryo-Berry jackpot!

294
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,500
If I kill you, I'll have this
entire country all to myself!

295
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,960
Now that it's come to this,
I'm gonna blow you up flashily!

296
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,510
Men! Prepare the Special Buggy Ball!

297
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,250
Yes, sir!

298
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,220
I'll teach you a lesson for
deceiving me! Be prepared!

299
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,990
It's ready.

300
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,660
There's no need for formality.
Go ahead and fire now!

301
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,620
--Rice cakes!
--The rice cake tossing has started!

302
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,130
Ah! You bastards!

303
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,870
The one with the jackpot might've
been among the ones we just tossed.

304
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,970
Well, he said he didn't want it anymore.

305
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,720
You bastards! It was a slip of the tongue!

306
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,680
You're causing trouble!
Time for you to go flying!

307
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,770
Good job, guys!

308
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,150
You guys got it, right?!
Find the jackpot no matter what!

309
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,160
Alrighty!

310
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,220
This one-thousand-year-old famous
Alabasta Castle now has three big holes

311
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,630
in its castle tower. This is all because of...

312
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,890
Hey, Straw Hat!

313
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,480
Luffy-san has already gone
down to pick up rice cakes.

314
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,690
Yummy! Yummy!

315
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,980
What's the matter, Igaram?
Why don't you toss the rice cake, too?

316
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,940
This is no time for that, my lord!

317
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,900
The castle tower is the stronghold of the castle!

318
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,700
Showing such a pitiful figure is unprecedented!

319
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,970
This'll hurt the country's dignity, too!

320
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,020
Where are you saying the damage is?

321
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,660
Huh?!

322
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,170
Look at them, Igaram.
They all look like they're having fun.

323
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,360
A country is its people.

324
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,210
People's vitality is indeed the
source of the country's dignity.

325
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,910
The country wouldn't decline
for a reason as small

326
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,100
as the appearance of the castle falling apart.

327
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,960
Here you go!

328
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,480
If people are full of energy,
the country will become full of energy,

329
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,350
and that will become our vitality, too.

330
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,420
Although there was some trouble,
everyone is rejoicing.

331
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,440
That's all we ask, right?

332
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,180
A country is its people.

333
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,660
That certainly is true, right, Igaram?

334
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,420
Indeed...

335
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,970
But my lord, how will you come up
with the repair cost for all this?

336
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,950
Do as you see fit.

337
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,140
Yes, sire.

338
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,430
You're too avaricious, Boss.

339
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,060
This isn't the one.

340
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,390
Where's the jackpot?!

341
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,410
Onami... I can't eat anymore.

342
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,790
Thanks for waiting! I gathered more!

343
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,980
No way!

344
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,210
Come to think of it, Father,
where's the one with the jackpot?

345
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,900
Oh, that's right.

346
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,500
--Oh, my...
--I almost forgot.

347
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,210
Let's see who'll get it.

348
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,930
There!

349
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,960
Whoa!

350
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,030
I finally got a rice cake! Thank heavens!

351
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,940
What's this? A rice cake with a seed?

352
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,860
I can't eat something like this!

353
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,230
Oh, boy...

354
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,970
He sure doesn't have any interest in money.

355
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,040
"Happy New Year"

356
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,670
My strength... is ebbing away.
What'd you do to me?!

357
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,970
Can you figure out the mystery of my powers?

358
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,600
I'll let you fully experience them now.

359
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,020
Oh? You thought I'd stay
on the floor without fighting?

360
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,060
Just watch! You're mistaken if
you think I'm just a cute beauty!

361
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

362
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,600
"Bubble Master Kalifa!
The Soap Trap Closes in on Nami"

363
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
