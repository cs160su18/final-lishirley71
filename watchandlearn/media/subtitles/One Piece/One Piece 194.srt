00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome treasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King of
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone dreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen through
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny is
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve your
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,570
Where am I?

18
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,460
Oh, you shouldn't move yet.

19
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,840
Chief! The golden belfry...

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,090
We still have the duty
to protect it to the end!

21
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,120
Don't rush, Wyper.

22
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,400
Vearth, at least, is not refusing anyone.

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,860
Right... Right now, at
least,no one wants to fight.

24
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,160
It's party time!!

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680
The long battle of 400 years had ended,

26
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,060
and all the citizens of Skypiea
continued their joyous party day after day.

27
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,020
"I Made It Here! The Yarn
the Poneglyphs Spin"

28
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,440
I... I... I can't drink any more...

29
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,090
There they are!

30
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,060
Hey!

31
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,010
What is it?

32
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,650
Nami, wake everyone up!

33
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,460
Why?

34
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,130
We're gonna steal the gold and run!

35
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,880
There's gold?!

36
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,550
Idiot! Not so loud!

37
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,170
What do you mean "idiot"?!You're
louder than I am!

38
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,510
Hey! I'm louder, you
say?!You're the louder one!

39
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,480
What?! You're calling me loud when
you're really super loud?!

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,760
Your voice is the one that's really
super-mega-ultra loud!!

41
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,190
There's no way that's true!!I'm
talking loud because you're loud!

42
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,930
You're the one who spoke loud first!

43
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,930
Shut up! I can't sleep!!

44
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,060
What?! You're the loud one!!

45
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,060
It wasn't me! It was you!

46
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,830
I'm a delicate woman! I wouldn't
yell with my mouth wide open, would I?!

47
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,270
What?! There's no way I'd
do something like that!

48
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,270
See? See?! Your mouth is wide open!

49
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,260
Geez, wake up, sleepyhead!

50
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,100
But you did hit me here!
Here! It's really true!!

51
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,670
Nami-san! Good morning!!

52
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,730
That's because you ticked me off!

53
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,680
Oh? It's not morning yet!

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,680
Yeah, yeah... Go ahead and be
feeble-minded like that.

55
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,180
Like I said, you don't have
to shout, you know!!

56
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,560
What do you mean, "feeble-minded"?!

57
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,560
Blue Sea people sure like
to party, don't they?

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,900
This is the fourth day in a
row.Their vitality isn't normal.

59
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,540
So, that's the plan.

60
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,020
Okay, guys! It's not often that we
get to visit a sky island!

61
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,230
Make it so that you'll have no regrets!

62
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,480
He's so cool!

63
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,120
This is getting exciting!

64
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,640
Chief! We found the golden bell!!

65
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,050
What?!

66
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,440
Hey, are you serious?!

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,410
Yeah. It's stuck on the fallen Giant Jack.

68
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,790
We're pulling it out right now.

69
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,110
Those who can help, come to the western
seashore! Hurry! Hurry up!!

70
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,160
Okay, guys! Gather everyone!!

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,080
Hurry to the western seashore!

72
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,610
The belfry was found!

73
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,600
Where?!

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,870
At the western seashore.

75
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,920
Okay!

76
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,630
Are you sure?!

77
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,380
Yeah! Hurry!

78
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,870
They said they found the
bell that fell in the sea!

79
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,340
Yeah. Those who can move,gather
at the western seashore!

80
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,080
The belfry was found!It's
at the western seashore!!

81
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,180
The belfry was?

82
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,520
One more time!!

83
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,820
One, two...!

84
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,650
Pull!!

85
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,010
Dammit! We still need more people.

86
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,560
It's the pride of our ancestors'
city,Shandora. We'll get it at any cost!

87
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,390
That's right!

88
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,300
Give it everything you got!!One
more time!! One, two...!

89
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,840
Pull harder!!

90
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,550
Rubber band?! So you call
this a rubber band?!

91
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,520
Yeah! My Usopp Rubber Band did 90%of
the work of taking Giant Jack down!

92
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,650
Whoa! Incredible!

93
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,650
Whoa!

94
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,070
I'm the only one in the world that has them.

95
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,260
Whoa! Amazing!

96
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,390
Whoa!

97
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,990
But... put that aside for now.I'd
like to show you this iron sheet!

98
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,940
Now, ladies and gentlemen!This
is no ordinary iron sheet!

99
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,550
I tore it off from the Going Merry,our
ship that endured very hard travels

100
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,300
on the Grand Line, as well as
Eneru's attacks! It's the "King of Iron Sheets"!

101
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,220
How about it?! You guys want iron, right?

102
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,560
Would you trade me dials for this?

103
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,310
No! I want this rubber band!I'll
trade you for this rubber band!

104
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,850
I want one, too! Is that okay?!

105
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,700
Me, too!

106
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,830
Whoa... Are they serious?!

107
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,680
Give me one, too!--Me, too!

108
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,860
Water, light, fire...

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,580
Things whose shape is transient...

110
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,740
Things with no form...

111
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,690
I cut them!!

112
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,100
Shells! I got shells! Oh, yeah!

113
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,740
Lucky, lucky! I got so lucky!

114
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,400
You're in a good mood, aren't you, Usopp?

115
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,230
Did the negotiation go well?

116
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,090
Hear that? I got lots of dials!

117
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,050
I press it and...

118
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,620
Just like that!

119
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,840
Good for you.

120
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,950
Good for me! With this many dials,I
can do many different things!

121
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,390
The Usopp factory'll be running full steam!

122
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,060
Hey, Zoro, if you make your
swords Flavor Swords

123
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,610
and store the smell of stuff
like melons in them,

124
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,120
you can enjoy your everyday training!

125
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,850
No thanks.

126
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,770
Oh...

127
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,310
Oh, yeah! I can make Nami's
Clima Takt stronger!

128
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,240
My slingshot will be incredible, too!

129
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,710
So, where are Robin, Luffy and the others?

130
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,810
Luffy and the others are still
inside.Robin went somewhere.

131
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,170
In any case... this snake's
really conked out.

132
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,600
He kept dancing day after day...

133
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,940
...though I don't know what
he was so happy about.

134
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,270
Anyhow, they'd better come out soon,

135
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,460
because if he wakes up,he could
give them a hard time again.

136
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,490
Huh? This good-tempered snake?

137
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,400
Idiot! You just don't knowhow
troublesome he can be!

138
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,380
This good-tempered snake?

139
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,250
Like I said, you can be so optimistic
because you didn't see

140
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,610
what a pain this snake can be.

141
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,570
This good-tempered snake?

142
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,180
Hey, now listen here, Usopp!

143
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,810
This good-tempered snake?

144
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,360
It was a Tone Dial!

145
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,070
Don't do stupid stuff like that!!

146
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,040
Yeah, it's stupid! It's really stupid!

147
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,730
What the heck?! What does this snake eat?

148
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,230
Are we there, yet, Luffy?

149
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,930
Look! There they are!!

150
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,680
Wow! Amazing!

151
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,720
This is the real thing!

152
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,010
It's pretty! It looks just like the
ones that we saw at the monkeys' house!

153
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,760
See? See? See?! There's all this!

154
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,940
Isn't it awesome?!

155
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,490
So this is gold...

156
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,300
How beautiful...

157
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,300
Incredible...

158
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,740
I didn't expect it to be this...

159
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,980
How magnificent.

160
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,530
But one of the side columns has been broken.

161
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,410
Yeah, but there isn't much we can do.

162
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,000
Hey! Look at that.

163
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,220
So this is... the Poneglyph...

164
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,690
The stone that our ancestors risked
the city's life to protect...!

165
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,210
Just what is written on it, Chief?

166
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,580
Something we're better off not knowing...

167
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,400
We just...

168
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,990
"Hold our true motive in
your hearts and speak not of it.

169
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,250
We are the ones who weave history...

170
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,670
...with the sounding of the grand belfry..."

171
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,220
How do you know those words?

172
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,070
They were carved on the Shandoran ruins.

173
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,960
So you were the keepers,entrusted
with this for generations.

174
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,070
Could it be... You can
read those characters?!

175
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,350
Poseidon, the "ancient
weapon"named after a God...

176
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,390
Its whereabouts...

177
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,350
What?! What's that?!

178
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,310
She said "ancient"!

179
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,880
Ancient weapon?

180
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,940
Why is it talking about something like that?!

181
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,460
Yeah...

182
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,840
Another weapon...

183
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,130
...separate from Pluton that
I read about in Alabasta...

184
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:50,340
I hear that one shot from Pluton will
completely destroy an island.

185
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,210
To think that there are such dangerous things
in this world waiting to be found...!

186
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,930
Just as I thought, this was a disappointment.

187
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,690
This isn't what I want to know.

188
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,080
Hey! Aren't those the same kind of characters
on that engraving next to it?!

189
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,040
What?!

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,420
"Gol D. Roger"...!

191
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,120
What?!

192
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,950
I made it here. I will guide
this text to the ends of the earth.

193
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,380
Pirate Gol D. Roger.

194
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,740
King of the Pirates...! Could this mean that
he came to this sky island, too?!

195
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,440
What on earth do these words mean?!

196
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,530
No, more importantly,why can
he use these characters?

197
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,690
So it says Roger?

198
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,100
You know him?!

199
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,320
He's a Blue Sea pirate who came to
this sky more than 20 years ago.

200
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,660
So his name is engraved there?

201
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,890
Yes. I don't know how he reached this bell,

202
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,660
but this sure is indelible proof that he did.

203
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,810
Come to think of it, there're
two kinds of Poneglyph stones.

204
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,680
Ones with information, and others that
indicate their whereabouts.

205
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,170
And this stone is one of the
ones with information.

206
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,240
"I made it here. I will guide
this text to the ends of the earth."

207
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,440
Guide this text... Guide...

208
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,210
It couldn't be...!Could
the Rio Poneglyph be...?!

209
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,190
Chief... This Poneglyphhas
already fulfilled its role!

210
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,680
It has?!

211
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,030
That's right. I bet those Poneglyphs
with information scattered around the world

212
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,240
will, when put together, become one text

213
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,110
that will fill the "Blank
History"for the first time.

214
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,790
In other words, the text completed
by connecting them...

215
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,740
That is the Rio Poneglyph,which
still does not exist.

216
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,230
Gol D. Roger, King of the Pirates,

217
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,640
definitely delivered this
text to its destination.

218
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,650
So it's no longer...

219
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,580
Then...

220
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,140
Hm?

221
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,860
...does that mean that our
duty has been fulfilled as well?

222
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,820
We...

223
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,170
We... don't have to... fight any longer?

224
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,500
I see... Our ancestors'
wish has been fulfilled, then?

225
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,260
Chief!

226
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,970
Chief!

227
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,250
Are you all right?!

228
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,870
Good... Good... So our
duty has been fulfilled!

229
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,540
Yes.

230
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,280
Which means I, too,

231
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,310
have to guide the text on those Poneglyphs
that I read in the past...

232
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,840
...to the end of the Grand
Line... to Raftel...

233
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:48,310
Young lady, the feeling that straw hat
kid gives me is reminiscent of Roger.

234
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,010
Is it my imagination?

235
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,840
His name is Monkey D. Luffy.My
interest in him never fades.

236
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,360
D? I see. He's got the
same letter in his name.

237
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,540
Yes... and I'm sure it's a big issue that
has something to do with history.

238
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,160
By the way, young lady...You
guys wanted gold, right?

239
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,290
You said it's more valuable than
Vearth in the Blue Sea.

240
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,360
Yes.

241
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,540
How about taking the broken belfry column,

242
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,100
though we can't give you the bell...

243
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,880
That's a good idea!

244
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,860
Naturally, we have to show
our appreciation to you guys somehow.

245
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,800
That's right!

246
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,710
Don't hold back!

247
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,670
Are you sure?! They'll be happy to hear that!

248
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,070
Yeah!

249
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,930
Alright, then! Let's bring this
to the Blue Sea people!

250
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,280
Wrap it with cloths! It's hard to carry!

251
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,430
We'll give this to those who saved our land!

252
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,450
Man, this thing's huge...

253
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,640
What's Robin doing? She's late!

254
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,150
Darn! I'm hungry!

255
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,030
In any case, this place is so
empty. What's going on?

256
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,480
Where the heck did
the guerrillas and angels go?

257
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,870
Well, it's better they aren't here.If
they find us, they'll chase us around!

258
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,830
Since we're trying to steal this much gold
and run, they won't just let us go!

259
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,700
Well, Nami and Conis are preparing to
set sail, but we still have to hurry.

260
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,190
Before that, Sanji, do
you have something to eat?

261
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,430
Not until we get to the ship.

262
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,170
But you've gotta have something
to munch on, right?

263
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,470
What a pain!

264
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,470
Give me some!

265
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,280
We don't have to wait for that woman, do we?

266
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,850
I can't give you what
I don't have! Just give up!

267
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,100
I'm gonna go on ahead and get on board.

268
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,300
Idiot! Don't!

269
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,020
Idiot!

270
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,080
Idiot Moss Head!

271
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,240
Moss Head Idiot!

272
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,570
If you go into the forest alone, you
won't make it three steps without getting lost!

273
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,660
Hey, look! It's Robin!

274
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,320
Robin-chan!!

275
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:08,320
Yoo-hoo, Robin!! Hurry! Hurry up!We've
gotta run!! We stole some gold!

276
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,470
Idiot! Don't say that!Take
a good look behind her!!

277
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,440
They're all coming back here together!

278
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,850
There's tons of them!!

279
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,840
This is bad! This is bad! This is super bad!!

280
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,880
And what's that? A huge cannon?!

281
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,500
That's gotta be it!!

282
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,290
They all came back all at once!

283
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,410
Hurry to the ship! We can
no longer stay here!!

284
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,960
Check this out! We got a good
catch!The bag's stuffed! We're rich!

285
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,350
Hm? They all have bags on their back!

286
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,010
Don't tell me... Are they already leaving?!

287
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,800
Hey, stop, you guys!! Stop!!

288
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,960
Hey! Stop! Stop, you guys!

289
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,010
See?! They found us out!

290
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,470
Run!!

291
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,220
I'll strike a pose and say it!

292
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,650
You guys say, "Stop! Stop!" but...

293
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,780
Yeah! Tell them, Usopp!!

294
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
We risked our lives to come all
the way to this sky island!

295
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,980
That's right!

296
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,210
And we've found the legendary city of gold!

297
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,730
Robin-chan! Hurry up! We'll be caught!

298
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,200
How the heck can we, proud pirates,

299
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,610
just go back empty-handed?!

300
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,960
What?! Caught?! What's he talking about?

301
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,490
All we want to do is thank them!

302
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,370
Hey Miss, aren't you
guys gonna take this gold?

303
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,110
Looks like they don't need it!

304
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,800
What?!

305
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, no!

306
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,350
Run!!

307
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,830
Hey! Wait!

308
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,480
They're all after us! It's scary!

309
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,390
How was that?! Wasn't I cool?!

310
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,460
Yeah! Well done!

311
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,290
Robin-chan! Hurry!!

312
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,700
Hey! Come back!!

313
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,930
Guys! Keep running all the way
to the end of the sky!!

314
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,340
Yeah!!

315
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

316
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens as you wander about

317
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,you
keep your gaze constant

318
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection
wanes as you slowly disappear

319
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

320
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who
spend countless nights drifting

321
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

322
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

323
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,300
Listen, everyone! We'll split the
treasure once we get back down, okay?!

324
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,440
I'll keep it safe, so don't worry.

325
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,990
Where?!

326
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,690
It's a secret.

327
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,450
There's no way I'll tell you where I
hide my secret stash, right?!

328
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,040
Hey!

329
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,890
Just kidding!

330
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,380
That's a lie! Her eyes say
she's telling the truth!

331
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,240
Alright, guys! We're going
back to the Blue Sea!!

332
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,180
Yeah!!

333
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,850
"Off to the Blue Sea!!
Finale Woven by Feelings"

335
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
