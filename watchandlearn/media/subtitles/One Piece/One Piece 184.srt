00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,890
God Eneru and Luffy finally
clashed on the Ark Maxim.

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,890
What the hell... are you?!

19
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,060
I'm Luffy.

20
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,270
I'm a pirate and a rubber person.

21
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,380
Rubber?

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,060
Lightning has no effect
whatsoever on a rubber person.

23
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,750
Strong as Eneru is, he
felt threatened by Luffy.

24
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,000
Grom... Puddling!

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,380
Gum-Gum... Battle-Axe!!

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,340
As the battle intensified,
the golden Ark Maxim finally took off.

27
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,160
The circuit to this ark's ultimate feature
is already open and functioning.

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,470
Its name is Deathpiea.
It's despair, the savior of this world.

29
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,900
You think it's okay for a
god to destroy everything?!

30
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,480
Gum-Gum... Bazooka!!

31
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,340
Gum-Gum...

32
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,840
...Rifle!!

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,670
"Luffy Falls!
God's Judgment and Nami's Wish!!"

34
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,550
Ahh! The ship is leaving the Vearth!

35
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,540
It's flying! What should we do?!
The ship's gonna fly away!

36
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,800
You did it! You did it!!

37
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,930
You defeated Eneru!!

38
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,660
B-But the ship is... the ship is flying away!

39
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,820
Don't tell me...! Is he still getting up?!

40
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,040
You fools!

41
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,460
I-Is that all you've got?

42
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,310
Once you're gone, the world will be mine!

43
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,480
Once again, everyone will fear me,
worship me, and revere me.

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,110
My world!!

45
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,240
Vermin like you are no match for me!

46
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,960
To me... nothing is impossible!!

47
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,380
I am the Almighty God!!

48
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,180
Get out of here!

49
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,420
Look! Something is floating
in the sky above Upper Yard!

50
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,420
A... A ship?!

51
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,020
That can't be! A flying ship...
I've never heard of such a thing!

52
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,720
So that ship's what caused
the sky to become dark?!

53
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,790
God is on that ship!

54
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,160
Hey!

55
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,060
Get out of here, now!

56
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,290
Board the ships!

57
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,410
Lots of ships are leaving Angel Island!

58
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,130
What on earth is going on?
Those dark clouds... What happened?!

59
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,260
Hm? Someone is coming this way!

60
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,980
Ahoy! Shandians!!

61
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,340
You should immediately
prepare your ships as well!

62
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,890
This nation is lost!

63
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,760
What?!

64
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,540
Escape!

65
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,620
To the Blue Sea!

66
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,310
T... To the Blue Sea?!

67
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,440
A ship...

68
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,150
God... Eneru...

69
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,290
Feast your eyes, rubber person...

70
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,130
...on the falling island's despair.

71
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,650
This will be the end of the sky island.

72
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,680
The lives of the angels will be terminated.

73
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,580
No one can stop it any longer.

74
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,350
Of course... that includes you!

75
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,740
Stop it!!

76
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,760
Grom...

77
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,700
The golden wall...!

78
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,020
How dare...

79
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,400
...Puddling!!

80
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,030
Ow! Ouch!

81
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,240
He melted it using the electric heat!

82
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,190
Dammit, it burns!! Ahh!!

83
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,420
Luffy!!

84
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,000
It doesn't come off! Dammit!

85
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,420
Rubber person from the Blue Sea...

86
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,210
...I don't have to fight you, you know.

87
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,180
Take this off! You bastard!!

88
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,650
After all, I couldn't stand taking
a hit while fighting you again.

89
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,870
So...

90
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,140
...why don't we part here?

91
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,570
In honor of the good fight
you put up, I'll give you...

92
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,080
...this gold!!

93
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,030
Luffy!!

94
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,950
Once I confine you, the world
will be mine, just as it was before.

95
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,750
There will be no one in
the world who can defeat me.

96
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,160
"In the world"?!

97
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,200
Are you stupid or what?
There are lots who can!

98
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,600
In the Blue Sea, there're
tons of monstrous fighters!

99
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,660
Someone like you is...

100
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,220
You sure are a talkative brat, aren't you?

101
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,990
Fall! Together with the sky island!

102
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,060
Someone like you is...!!

103
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,560
N-No!!

104
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,930
Luffy!!

105
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,910
Luffy...

106
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,570
Damn you!!

107
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,770
That's Luffy, Horsey-Bird! Luffy's falling!

108
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,180
That's... Aisa! Pierre!

109
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,170
So that's who it was...
that sly voice I've been hearing.

110
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,790
Fight me!!

111
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,400
Luffy! We're coming to save you!

112
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,200
How annoying! You're wasting your time!

113
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,010
Aisa! Pierre! Watch out! Dodge it!

114
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,410
Eneru!!

115
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,200
God's Judgment!

116
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,300
El Thor!!

117
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,020
Luffy!!

118
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,530
Aisa!! Pierre!!

119
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,500
"God"

120
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,740
Luffy... Aisa...

121
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,290
As tough as I am, that
still hit me pretty hard.

122
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,380
That rubber thing... was quite annoying.

123
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,390
However... this is the conclusion.

124
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,540
What a large ship...

125
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,260
So that's the ark that the
Divine Squad was forced to build.

126
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,630
Here, the northeast of the island.

127
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,120
After they get the gold, I'm meeting
up with them at this seashore.

128
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,060
Then, as soon as everyone
shows up, you can leave?

129
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,180
If necessary, I can go once
the treasure gets delivered.

130
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
N... Nami-san...

131
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,310
They're coming to the seashore in the
northeast... coming back to their ship.

132
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,730
I'll go there and wait...
for everyone to show.

133
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,530
And I have to guide them to the Blue Sea!

134
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm the only one who can show them
the way to escape the sky island!

135
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,380
I have to hurry to the Going Merry!

136
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,000
I had a long dream...
Yes, it was a dream about you.

137
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:05,910
Oh, Nami-san, you and I ate a forbidden
fruit and wandered in a paradise.

138
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,390
I don't wanna wake up... Let us stay
forever in this beautiful dream.

139
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,670
Oh, Nami-san...

140
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,090
Hmmm... What is it?

141
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,860
No!

142
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,570
I want to stay in the dream with Nami-san.

143
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,080
Hm...? Nami-san?

144
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,110
Where's Nami-san?

145
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,170
Hm?!

146
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,050
Nami-san!

147
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,120
Wh-What the hell is that?!

148
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,830
Mellorine... Mellorine, Mellorine...

149
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,410
Mellorine, Mellorine,
Mellorine, Mellorine, Mello--

150
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,520
Nami-san!!

151
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,120
Oh, no!!

152
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,400
Hey! Wake up, Usopp!
It's no time to be in bed! Idiot!

153
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,890
What is it? Hm? What hap...

154
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,830
Never mind that, just get ready!

155
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,440
Huh? G-Get ready?

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,580
We're gonna rescue Nami-san!

157
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,030
Rescue? Res...

158
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,970
That's right! Now I remember!
God! God appeared!!

159
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,550
Oh, no...

160
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,020
God, God, God, God...

161
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,020
He isn't here anymore! He's long gone!

162
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,760
Tremble, tremble, tremble,
fumble, fumble, fumble...

163
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,200
Nami-san was kidnapped by him!

164
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,230
N-Nami was?!

165
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,550
Dammit! She was kidnapped
because we're so pathetic.

166
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,190
Since she's cute...

167
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,340
Well, she was kidnapped?

168
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,560
Where?

169
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,250
There!

170
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
What?!

171
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,440
What is that?! A forest?! A ship?!

172
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,050
Though it was just for a
second, I saw her for sure!

173
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,150
Nami-san is on that ship.

174
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,700
It doesn't matter what it is!

175
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,870
In any case, she wasn't wearing her T-shirt.

176
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,980
That really doesn't matter!

177
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,660
I don't get the situation at all. Where are
Conis, weird knight and the others?!

178
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,850
I don't know. Anyway, we have to hurry!

179
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,180
Hey, where're we going, Sanji?!

180
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,370
Where else?! That ship!

181
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,970
What?!

182
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,390
If we get any further behind,
we won't be able to board!

183
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,170
Now is our only chance!

184
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,020
Um, am I going, too,
by any chance? To that place?

185
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,190
Of course!! You have that thing, right?!
The rope that you shoot out from your belly!

186
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,290
Oh, you mean "Usopp Aa-aa-aa"?!

187
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,930
Then I'll let you use this,
so I'll wait down here!

188
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,930
Just hurry up!

189
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,900
I don't want to! W-Wait a sec!

190
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,950
Idiot! There's no time to waste!!

191
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,550
I'm coming for you!! Nami-san!!

192
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,870
Now that the Ark Maxim has been activated,

193
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,910
even if they cry or scream, there is
no way for this nation to be saved.

194
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,010
The sky island will fall from the sky

195
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,850
and I, the Almighty God,
will rise up to the land without end,

196
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:44,160
to the Endless Vearth...
on the golden ark, Maxim.

197
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,060
That's right. I shouldn't forget...

198
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,570
...to pick up that treasure
on my way up there.

199
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,380
The huge golden bell that
Shandora took pride in,

200
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,210
and the grand belfry for that bell...

201
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,370
I needed to see the belfry.

202
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,500
A golden bell...

203
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,920
A huge bell that's the most befitting
to me, who rules the heavens!

204
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,990
What's the matter? You're lucky
enough to have made it this far.

205
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,190
Abandon those who are incompetent.

206
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,970
You must have a future you wish for, right?

207
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,810
A future I wish for...

208
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,070
Yes, I do.

209
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,670
But if I just stay here and go with you,
it's the same as being alone.

210
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,120
Let's get this party goin'! It's the
night festival before gold-hunting!

211
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,330
Let's get the treasure!

212
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,090
Gold!

213
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,510
Gold!

214
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,940
Where's the fun in gaining
what you want all by yourself?

215
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,780
There're actually a lot of things
I want and that I'd like to do,

216
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,930
but if I have to abandon those
guys and go with you like this...

217
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,220
...then I don't want anything anymore!!

218
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,240
You don't want anything?

219
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,980
That includes your life, right?

220
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,550
What's going on?! Hey, Suu?

221
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,730
Both Usopp-san and Sanji-san
aren't in shape to be moving around!

222
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,480
What happened?!

223
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,170
Why aren't they here? Where are those two?!

224
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,800
"Um..."

225
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,940
"Oh, yeah!"

226
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,640
"The guy with the cool
eyebrows woke up first..."

227
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,460
Sanji-san woke up...

228
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,480
...and woke Usopp-san up.

229
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,180
"...and he woke up the
dubious guy with a long nose."

230
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,150
"They ran very hard..."

231
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,780
And they both ran,

232
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,450
"...jumped using a weird gadget..."

233
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,870
and jumped... into the sky?

234
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,850
"...and went to that flying ship."

235
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,110
What?! Don't tell me...!
They went to that ship?!

236
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,310
Their bodies still aren't...

237
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,410
How reckless!

238
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,540
A-Are we really going to do it?!

239
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,590
Are we really, seriously, going
to do it in this strong wind?!

240
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,080
Ahh... My "Can't Go to
High Places" disease is...

241
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,530
Like I said, I'll let you use this,
so go by yourse...!

242
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,060
Stop rambling nonsense!!

243
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,580
Now!! Come on!

244
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,780
I won't be responsible for this!

245
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,730
Come on... reach it!!

246
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,180
That's not really a smart thing to say.

247
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,690
Now you've lost the means to survive.

248
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,590
If you don't want to be on this ship,
then there is only one fate for you.

249
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,560
Go to the afterlife.

250
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,030
Ahh! I don't like this! Come off! Come off!

251
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,660
Shut up!

252
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,250
Yes, sir.

253
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,380
Usopp! Don't swing, dummy!

254
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,880
You idiot!!

255
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,390
Usopp Aa... aa...! Hey...!

256
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,410
God or not, if someone
lays a finger on Nami-san...

257
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,930
...I will become a devil of the Blue Sea!!

258
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,000
Nami-san!!

259
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,410
I'll put my all into this. Even if it
takes all my energy and brainpower,

260
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,980
I will survive!

261
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,690
One more time... Yes, to sail out to
sea with everyone one more time!

262
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,780
Luffy... I'm gonna borrow your courage!

263
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

264
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

265
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

266
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

267
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

268
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

269
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

270
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

271
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,330
How dare you kidnap Nami-san?!
Bastard! You won't get away with this!!

272
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,840
If I stay here, I'll die for sure!
I have to escape somehow!

273
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,480
There is no salvation for you at this point!

274
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,200
What are we gonna do against God?!

275
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,540
Go... to the afterlife!

276
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,280
Just hold on! I'll protect you
even if it costs me Usopp's life!

277
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,390
Um, mine?

278
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,680
On the next episode of One Piece!

279
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,650
"The Two Awaken! On the Front Lines
of the Burning Love Rescue!!"

280
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
