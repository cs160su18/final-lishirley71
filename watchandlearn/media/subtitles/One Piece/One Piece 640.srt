We are the one! Go ahead!

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,640
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,120
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,980
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,400
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,800
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

77
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,610
was the Flare-Flare Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,650
Meanwhile, after falling in
love with Violet, Sanji made a

79
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,480
raid on an unknown villain's hide-out

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,880
to grant her wish. However...

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,180
Can I ask you a favor?

82
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,030
Huh?

83
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,650
Then will you...

84
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,420
...die for me, "Black Foot" Sanji?

85
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,790
What? V-Violet-chan?
What are you talking about?

86
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,990
What an idiot.

87
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,770
At the same time, Usopp and the others are

88
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,570
heading to Green Bit to hand Caesar over.

89
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,840
It stopped.

90
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,450
--We caught it!
--Alright, let's pull it in!

91
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,160
A very wild forest?!

92
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,740
"Explore!
Fairies' Island - Green Bit!"

93
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,290
Th-This is...

94
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,700
...Green Bit?!

95
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,570
What are those giant plants?!

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,830
Hey, Joker, it's me! Pick me up!

97
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,830
Don't be in such a rush.

98
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,940
That is the beach on
the southeast side of the island.

99
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,340
We will leave you there
at three in the afternoon.

100
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,750
He will come soon.

101
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,380
Look at the beach on the other side!

102
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,820
Isn't that a Navy ship?!

103
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,480
It got stuck on the island!
It's not just beached!

104
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,260
How is it possible?!

105
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,570
Those cuts on the plants look fresh.

106
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,520
What?

107
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,440
I estimate that ship arrived recently.

108
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,590
Its body is not as damaged as I thought.

109
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,250
Did they make it through
the water filled with the Fighting Fish?!

110
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,890
It's only a matter of time
before the Navy soldiers get here.

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,450
What?!
Do they know about the trade-off?!

112
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,060
I didn't know that!

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,860
You stupid scientist, you're too loud!
Shh! Shh!

114
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,130
Hey, I'm a wanted person!

115
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,800
Since my boss - Joker resigned
from the Warlords,

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,040
there isn't any law that protects me!

117
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,890
If you leave me with handcuffs on

118
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,140
on the island where the Navy
soldiers are wandering, I'll...

119
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,020
I said "Shh! Be quiet!"

120
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,350
Wait a minute! Joker is
just a pirate now, too!

121
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,080
Either way, I'm doomed!

122
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,800
This is hell!

123
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,550
Enough, you idiot!
We're all screwed if the Navy finds us!

124
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,060
Why is the Navy here?

125
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,770
You look like you're hiding something.

126
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,210
It's just a coincidence.

127
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,050
How could I control the Navy?

128
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,040
By the way,

129
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,030
I'm thinking about going to Green Bit.

130
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,120
I wonder if I can handle the Straw Hats.

131
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,040
It's not fair to hand me over here!
Abort this mission!

132
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,450
The Navy is my enemy, too,

133
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,070
since I'm allied with the Straw Hats.

134
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,800
Don't tell me you set me up!

135
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,950
We still have 15 minutes before they come.

136
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,610
Everyone, cover me with
sniping and surveillance.

137
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,130
They may be hiding.
Go check the forest.

138
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,000
If you find something,
let me know as soon as possible.

139
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,060
Okay, I got it.

140
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,150
Wait a minute!

141
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,190
We didn't expect the Navy to be here so...

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,620
R-Robin!

143
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,600
This forest is dangerous! Wait!

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,020
Let's not get separated!

145
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,380
Thank you for being so manly, Usopp.

146
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,150
You're too loud!

147
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,540
Oh no!

148
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,400
Please don't leave me!

149
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,480
Can you walk a little more slowly?

150
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,560
Ouch! Don't stop suddenly, Robin...

151
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,110
Who is it?! The Straw Hats?!

152
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,110
They found us!

153
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,520
Shh.

154
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,760
Where?! Where are they?!

155
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,170
Just surrender without resistance!

156
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,500
We know you're here on the island!

157
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,760
Damn! Come on out, Straw Hats!

158
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,190
That's not my name! I'm Leo!

159
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,320
Who is it?! Where is he?!

160
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,980
It's the Navy soldiers.
Who are they talking to?

161
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,320
Looks like they knew
we were coming to this island.

162
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,740
Are you good people or bad people?!

163
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,540
We're Navy soldiers! We protect citizens.

164
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,320
We're definitely good people!

165
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,000
Then, hand over your weapons!

166
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,190
You can't have our weapons!
We have work to do!

167
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,000
--Hey, who are you?!
--Show yourself!

168
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,680
So that is your answer.

169
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,340
Where are you?!

170
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,310
Hey, where is your cape?!

171
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,350
My gun!

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Oh?!

173
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,090
What was that?!

174
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,240
My hat!

175
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,690
Oh no!

176
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,640
Huh?! What's going on?!

177
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,010
I can't see. It's too fast.

178
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,560
--What is this forest?!
--Dammit!

179
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
We got stripped of all we have!

180
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,430
That will teach you!
You villainous Big Humans!

181
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,730
Yeah!

182
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,620
What?

183
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,550
Mil Fleurs! Campo de Flores!

184
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,030
I caught one!

185
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,690
Huh?! What did you catch?!

186
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,430
I think it's a little person!

187
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,230
What?!

188
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,250
Help me!

189
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,300
Kabu-san!

190
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,730
We have a problem!

191
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,040
Let go of me!

192
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,100
I thought so!

193
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,230
I got caught!

194
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,580
DRESSROSA - THE PORT TOWN "ACACIA"

195
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,530
Turn right! I said "Right"!

196
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,960
Why did you turn left?!

197
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,530
Shut up! Be quiet! You're distracting me!

198
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,230
What the...

199
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,950
Mom, he's talking to himself...

200
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,040
Don't look him in the eye!

201
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,630
I'm in hurry!

202
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,380
Not as much as I am!

203
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,070
If I can't make it, it's your fault!

204
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,850
Get to the Flower Field already!

205
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,490
All right! Just shut up!

206
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,430
Give me back my sword!

207
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,110
What?

208
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,100
Oh no!

209
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,970
Ow, ow, ow... This is no good!

210
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,250
I'm so dumb! This human will see me!

211
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,240
I have to run! Otherwise, the human will...

212
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,100
Excuse me.

213
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,650
Who are you?!

214
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,860
I'm so dumb!

215
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,290
So dumb and stupid and blockheaded!

216
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,350
I always knew I'd fail like this!

217
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,980
Is this what they call a fairy?

218
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,650
Is it a toy?

219
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,970
WICKA - A MEMBER OF THE SCOUTING UNIT OF
THE TONTATTA (A TRIBE OF LITTLE PEOPLE)

220
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not a toy!

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,690
I'm Wicka from the Tontatta Tribe!

222
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,140
Please don't tell anybody that you saw me!

223
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,480
I beg you!

224
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,350
I don't know what's going on here.

225
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,800
I don't have time for this!

226
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,470
Huh?

227
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,700
I wasn't gonna eat you or anything.

228
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,110
Tell me what's going on.

229
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,610
I-I can't do that!

230
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,390
I can't share any information
with you Big Humans!

231
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm sorry! I gotta go!

232
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,130
What now?!

233
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,310
I can't walk!
I think I twisted my ankle earlier!

234
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,100
I'm so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb...

235
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,740
You're pretty strong!
You're smashing the ground.

236
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,710
Please!

237
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,770
Take me to my commander!

238
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,400
When you come right down to it,
it's kind of your fault.

239
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,750
You stole my sword!

240
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,450
"Stole"? What are you talking about?

241
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,820
We manage the greenery of this land!

242
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,960
The Big Humans of this kingdom call us "fairies"
and give us things!

243
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,270
"Give"? No, you're stealing them!

244
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,820
I said too much again!

245
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,060
I have to go!
I'm a member of a scouting unit!

246
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,250
I have to report the Don Quixote Family's

247
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,110
whereabouts to my commander!

248
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,360
Now is our chance!

249
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,960
I saw the Don Quixote Family on their way

250
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,350
to attack the Straw Hats' ship!

251
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,320
What?!

252
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,280
I have to go!
I'm a member of a scouting unit!

253
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,500
I have to report the Don Quixote Family's

254
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,510
whereabouts to my commander!

255
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,070
Now is our chance!

256
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,830
I saw the Don Quixote Family on their way

257
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,120
to attack the Straw Hats' ship!

258
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,170
What?!

259
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm so dumb! I told him everything!

260
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,470
Hey, is that true?!
I'm a member of the Straw Hats!

261
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,500
Dumb! So dumb!

262
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,110
Dumb! I'm so dumb! Dumb!

263
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,960
I'm a blockhead!

264
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,210
Whoa-whoa!

265
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,910
Stop wrecking the town!

266
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,220
Calm down, fairy!

267
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,720
Is it true that the

268
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,220
Don Quixote Family is going to
attack the Sunny?!

269
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,740
It's a secret! But I saw it!

270
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,630
Oh, I did it again!

271
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,770
I don't have a Transponder Snail.

272
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,870
There's no way to tell them about it.

273
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,090
Of all the others,

274
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,100
I can't believe they're attacking those four.

275
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,880
Alright, I'm gonna head back to the Sunny!

276
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,580
Wait!

277
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,580
Take me to the Flower Field first!

278
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,350
I'll guide you to the sea right after that!

279
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,450
No, I'm gonna head to the sea now!

280
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,620
But...

281
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,690
...you're running in the opposite direction!

282
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,030
You don't know which way to go, do you?!

283
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,000
So...

284
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,310
...Don Quixote's people were
following our movements.

285
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,310
Yes. And we were keeping an eye on them.

286
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,760
You guys have some kind of
a conflict with him, too?!

287
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,430
Yes! Oops!

288
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,420
That was a secret.

289
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,080
Damn! It's not only the ship that's in danger

290
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,510
but all of us!

291
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,730
Hey, are we there yet? The Flower Field?!

292
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,830
Go up the stairs there!

293
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,160
I said "Go up"!

294
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,830
Are you a b-blockhead?

295
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,890
Shut up!

296
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,230
Where did he hide? That coward!

297
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,120
Hey, that's Don Chinjao!

298
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,130
You got to be kidding.

299
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,460
I want to hear the sound of the gong

300
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,540
that signals the start of the match!

301
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,980
Hey, I think we better run!

302
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,540
Garp's grandson!

303
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,880
That sound signals your death!

304
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,540
Hey, we better run!

305
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,790
Prepare yourself!

306
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,300
Control yourself, old man!

307
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,670
They'll eliminate you
if you fight outside of the ring again!

308
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,910
Don't forget what we are here for, grandpa!

309
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,620
Let's go!

310
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,110
I know.

311
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,970
Oh, that was scary.

312
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,220
That old guy is such a pain in the butt.

313
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,260
Everybody's naked before my eyes.

314
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,670
I've seen everything that's been
in your mind since we first met.

315
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,270
I heard you have a soft spot for women

316
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,990
but I didn't expect it to be that soft.

317
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,810
How pathetic!

318
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Your collar is wrinkled up
and your tie is crooked.

319
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,290
Your shirt is stained with blood.

320
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,300
You look terrible.

321
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,610
You're a good-for-nothing,

322
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,320
"Black Foot" Sanji!

323
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,360
VIOLET - AN ASSASSIN OF
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY (THE TREBOL ARMY)

324
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,780
Did you really think that

325
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,610
a guy like you could win my heart?

326
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,080
How funny.

327
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,110
I can't believe you were
attracted by Sis' beauty,

328
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,480
you stupid jerk!

329
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,850
Didn't you know it was a trap?! You idiot!

330
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,660
You're lying, Violet-chan...

331
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,670
Hey, quit dreaming already!
Sis was just acting!

332
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,610
I-I know you have a beautiful heart...

333
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,170
How could you still say such a thing
after getting hurt so badly?

334
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,330
Hey, stand up!

335
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,230
You must have been coaxed
into this by some bad guys.

336
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,360
You don't even want to be here.

337
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,790
Violet-chan...

338
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,530
Why don't you quit being so romantic?!

339
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,050
So stupid!

340
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,130
--That's terrible! But she's beautiful!

341
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,750
--That was a hell of a kick, Sis!

342
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,730
You're trying to hold back
your anger against me

343
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,880
and looking for a way to run.

344
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,280
Do you think you can persuade me
with your lies?

345
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I don't fall for lies.

346
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,070
I ate the Glare-Glare Fruit and became

347
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,900
quite an insightful woman.

348
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,650
I can see through anything.

349
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,890
Men are all liars.

350
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,460
Let me see inside of your head.
It must be filled with lies.

351
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,790
Why did Trafalgar Law
and Straw Hat become allies?

352
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,250
What brought you to Dressrosa
besides the business at Green Bit?

353
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,570
What's your plan and what are you up to?!

354
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,480
You don't have to tell me.

355
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,770
All the answers are inside of your head.

356
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,780
We will catch all of your crewmates.

357
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,390
She's gonna strike the pose!

358
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,220
That's her true power!

359
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,550
Peeping Mind!

360
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,690
Wh-Wh-What's the matter?!

361
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,510
Sis!

362
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,450
H-How perverted!

363
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,780
Perverted?!

364
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,710
I've never seen anyone
who's whole mind is

365
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,140
as pink-colored as his!

366
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,670
What?!

367
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,490
What is your plan?!
What is your true purpose?!

368
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,740
What are you thinking
under these circumstances?!

369
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,970
I'm thinking about you.

370
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,240
The way you looked at me
at that moment...

371
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,720
I want you to kill someone!

372
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,750
I knew you were telling the truth!

373
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,960
It doesn't matter
if a million people accuse you, I...

374
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,660
I believe in women's tears!
