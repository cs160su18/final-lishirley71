2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,860
After being ejected from the Sabaody
Archipelago by Bartholomew Kuma,

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,790
Luffy was separated from his
friends and arrived alone

52
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,390
at the female-only empire of Amazon Lily.

53
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,650
Sentenced to death,

54
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,380
Luffy was forced to fight
Snake Princess Hancock's sisters

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,850
in a combat arena.

56
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,710
I can't wait to see Marigold-sama's
"Salamander" with my own eyes!

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,200
And Sandersonia-sama's
"Eight-Headed Serpent"!

58
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,750
There!

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,340
You're not cracked, are you?

60
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,780
Wait here, you guys!

61
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,700
Sorry you got turned
into stone because of me!

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,200
Alright, then...

63
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,710
So I just gotta kick your asses now, right?!

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,050
What a joke!

65
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,330
What did he just say?!

66
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,130
He intends to beat the younger sisters!

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,260
Hilarious! Making people laugh
after being sentenced to death!

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,930
Men really are hilarious!

69
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,080
Kill him, Sandersonia! Marigold!

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,900
Through combat, give him
the ultimate punishment

71
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,890
for the great crime of sneaking onto
our maiden island and offending me!

72
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,000
What the...?!

73
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,080
Poison?! That was close!

74
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,780
Gum-Gum

75
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,240
Stamp!

76
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,460
It bounced off!

77
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,100
That hurts!

78
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,460
How...?! I'm made of rubber!

79
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,920
Gum-Gum...

80
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,270
--...Gatling!
--Snake Dance.

81
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
What's going on?!

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
She's guessing my every move!

83
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,430
Snake Stick!

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,890
Ouch!

85
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,520
Hey! What're you doing?! Don't touch them!

86
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,300
What if she breaks?!

87
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,400
She saved my life, you know!

88
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,710
We are going to break her.

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,650
Stop it!

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,640
I said stop!

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,270
The warriors are fainting!

92
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,480
That was the Conqueror's Spirit just now...!

93
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,560
This can't be real!

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,630
Only one out of a million
people can master that Haki!

95
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,010
Only a chosen few can use it!

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,750
I've never seen any person who
can use it other than our big sister!

97
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,790
This boy has the "qualities of a conqueror"
to stand above others!

98
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,350
He has the Conqueror's Spirit, just as I do?!

99
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,530
How can this be?!

100
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,170
Is he no mere boy after all?!

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,130
Alright!

102
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,850
You showed me you're strong!

103
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,110
Now let's get on with the duel!

104
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,770
"All-Out Special Power Battle!!
Gum-Gum vs. Snake-Snake"

105
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,630
What are you hesitating for?!

106
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,250
Men are undeserving of fear!

107
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,940
Sonia-sama! Mari-sama!

108
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,550
Beat that man up!

109
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,490
Yes.

110
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,240
There's nothing to fear, Mari...

111
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,410
Yes.

112
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,820
If he can't control his enormous Haki,
then it's nothing but zeal!

113
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,250
But first...

114
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,500
If we're gonna go all out, we
better move her outta the way.

115
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,380
I wouldn't want to break her.

116
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,830
Oh, you sound quite confident.

117
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,210
It seems you still don't
understand the position you're in.

118
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,380
Who cares about that lousy statue?!

119
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,060
Margaret!

120
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,790
Why do you insist on protecting the statue,

121
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,650
even at the expense of being hit yourself?!

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,840
She has nothing to do with it...

123
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,660
She has nothing to do with this fight!

124
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,840
Very well. Let him move the statue.

125
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,580
Big Sis!

126
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,940
Let the man fight to his heart's content.

127
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,740
And then beat him completely senseless

128
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,920
and teach him just how insignificant men are!

129
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Right!

130
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,950
Wait here just a little longer.

131
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,800
I'll figure something out once I beat 'em up.

132
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,500
Okay! All set!

133
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,960
Oh, you're already ready?

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,660
Ready for us to beat you to a pulp?

135
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,210
I already told you.

136
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,350
You're the ones who're gonna get beat up.

137
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,000
You're still as insolent as ever!

138
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,940
Ouch! Damn!

139
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,350
That attack doesn't scare me
if you can't hit me with it!

140
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,580
Gum-Gum...

141
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,660
What is this smoke...?!

142
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,420
My poison dissolves whatever it touches.

143
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,910
But that's not all...

144
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,560
Marigold-sama's poison attack!

145
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,880
The man fell for it so easily!

146
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,200
Heh. This is nothing at all.

147
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,320
H-Huh?

148
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,700
What the...?!

149
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,530
I feel kinda woozy!

150
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,130
I won't take you lightly anymore.

151
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,530
You're my prey.

152
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,590
I'll weaken you with poison, corner you,

153
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,500
and then kill you for sure!

154
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,240
Just one whiff of my poison
will dull one's consciousness!

155
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
That hurts, dammit!

156
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,830
Gum-Gum Pistol!

157
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,600
Gum-Gum Pistol!!

158
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,530
What's the matter?

159
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,360
You can't even scratch us!

160
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,740
You seem to be at a real loss...

161
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
No matter how tough you may be,

162
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,440
if you can't control your power,
you're no different from a puny rat!

163
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,910
Just give it up!

164
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,960
Yes! He fell into the pit of blades!

165
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,500
I can see right!

166
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,360
I'm healed! The poison's gone!

167
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,730
His hand! It's the man's hand!

168
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,260
Look at that!

169
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,580
He just won't give up!

170
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,390
Mari-sama! Sonia-sama!
The man is still alive!

171
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,300
But what do I do about that poison smoke?

172
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,420
Gum-Gum...

173
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,530
...Balloon!

174
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,450
Go flying!

175
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,870
Alright! That's much better!

176
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,180
All the poison and smoke is gone now!

177
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,350
Now I can fight with an easy mind!

178
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,300
The man used his breath to
send the poison flying away!

179
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,900
Unbelievable!

180
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,660
Men are so mysterious!

181
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,780
Aren't they, though?!

182
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,260
You can fight with an easy mind, you say?

183
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,620
After being beaten so horribly,
you still spout such insolence?!

184
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,600
Alright...

185
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Now it's my turn to go full-power too.

186
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,120
Second Gear!

187
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,410
What is that?!

188
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,060
Smoke's coming from his body!

189
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,030
Is that how men are?!

190
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,910
What kind of creatures are they?!

191
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,740
Smoke! He's giving off smoke!

192
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,230
Full power?

193
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,030
Meaning you weren't at
full power this entire time?

194
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,600
So what if there's smoke
coming from your body?!

195
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,140
Have you forgotten that we
can read your every move

196
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,050
and that your attacks have no effect on us?

197
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm gonna try anyway.

198
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,360
Gum-Gum Jet...

199
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,530
It's no use!

200
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,570
...Pistol!

201
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Big Sis Sonia!

202
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,750
It looks like you weren't bluffing
about going full-power...

203
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,870
In that case, I'll bite you to death
with all the power I have too!

204
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,060
Medusa Hair...

205
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,590
...Eight-Headed Serpent!

206
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,270
Go!

207
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,230
Sandersonia-sama!

208
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,760
The fence around the arena!

209
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,710
The giant serpents are actually her hair,

210
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,900
yet it's like they have fangs of iron!

211
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,350
Why can't I hit him?!

212
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,130
I'm reading his every move ahead of time,

213
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,680
but I can't keep up!

214
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,430
Big Sis Sonia!

215
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,390
Gum-Gum...

216
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,280
It's no use!

217
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,270
Your attacks bounce right off,
as I showed you before!

218
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,260
As long as I can surpass your speed,

219
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,170
your brute strength attacks
cannot defeat my defense!

220
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,900
...Jet...

221
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,250
...Bazooka!

222
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,070
Sonia! Mari!

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,960
What are you two playing around for?!

224
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,370
B-Big Sis...!

225
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,870
Don't tell me you've forgotten
that man's transgressions!

226
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,580
S-Sorry, Big Sis!

227
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,350
We'll finish him at once!

228
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,730
Medusa Hair...

229
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,150
...Eight-Headed Serpent!

230
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,410
She's on fire!

231
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,880
Medusa Hair...

232
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,530
...Salamander!

233
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,790
We won't give you anywhere to run!

234
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,330
He's surrounded!

235
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,750
There's no escape now,
no matter how nimble he is!

236
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,540
There's no better attack than this!

237
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,040
Gum-Gum...

238
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,600
...Jet...

239
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,140
...Gatling!

240
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,840
Oh no!

241
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,050
Big Sis Sonia! Get away, quickly!

242
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,960
What?! I'm being dragged!

243
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,220
Our tails! When did he...?!

244
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,570
It's hot! It's hot! Help!

245
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,770
Wait, Big Sis! Don't pull me!

246
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,570
Big Sis Sonia! Watch out!

247
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,320
That's the pit of blades!
Hold on to the stands!

248
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,960
Th-That was close...

249
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,920
S-Sandersonia-sama?!

250
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,000
How pathetic!

251
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,790
Sonia's back...!

252
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,470
If...!

253
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,900
If the citizens should see it...!

254
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,320
Ouch! Hot!

255
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,860
That man!

256
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,330
He's kicking her when she's down!

257
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,330
He's inhuman!

258
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,490
He's going to knock Sonia-sama
Ninto the pit and skewer her!

259
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,710
Damn you, man!

260
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,680
Don't move!

261
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,060
Even if you guys wanna kill me,

262
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,440
I don't wanna kill you!

263
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,770
You insolent little...!

264
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,330
Mari! Use this chance to kill him!

265
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,790
What are you doing, Mari?!

266
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,450
I can't, Big Sis Sonia...!

267
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,950
Because...

268
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,060
he's protecting us right now...!

269
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,770
Look! Sandersonia-sama's
clothing burned off

270
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,560
and her back is showing!

271
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,160
If that man gets off her,
her Gorgon Eyes will be exposed!

272
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,110
Oh no!

273
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,530
Everyone who sees them
will be turned to stone!

274
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,690
My back...!

275
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,780
You guys said so earlier!

276
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,420
He saw my back.

277
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,550
Then he'll have to die.

278
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,460
Huh?! H-How come?! I only saw her back!

279
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,440
We would rather die

280
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,850
than let anyone see what you saw on my back!

281
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,680
You'd rather die than let
people see this, right?!

282
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,990
So don't move!

283
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,920
The combat is over!

284
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,390
Everyone leave the arena at once

285
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,860
before you're exposed to the Gorgon Eyes!

286
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,480
Oh no! We gotta get outside!

287
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,130
We'll be petrified!

288
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,160
Hurry! Hurry!

289
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,660
The Gorgon's curse!

290
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,410
I was fighting you just moments ago.

291
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,160
Why are you protecting me?

292
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,410
Our fight and the thing you don't
want seen are two separate things.

293
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:47,270
You now owe your lives to
the man you tried to execute.

294
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,910
Maybe you can fool the country,

295
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,660
but you cannot fool yourself
forever, Snake Princess.

296
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,310
The thing etched onto the
backs of you three sisters is...

297
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,030
After Luffy saves the
sisters from a tight spot,

298
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,850
they reveal their secret to him.

299
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,770
Hancock suppresses the fear
rising from deep within her

300
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,020
as she reveals the wounds in her heart.

301
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,800
It turns out a wicked shadow
lurks in her past...

302
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,590
On the next episode of One Piece!

303
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,070
"Hancock's Confession
The Sister's Abhorrent Past"

304
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
