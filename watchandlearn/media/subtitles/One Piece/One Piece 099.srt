00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:14,740
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,890
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,020
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,900
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing.

25
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,810
As Luffy and company left
the green city of Erumalu

26
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,870
for the Yuba oasis,
where the rebel army is,

27
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,370
they met sand pirates, and set out
after attaining new friendship.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,180
"False Fortitude!
Camu, Rebel Soldier at Heart!"

29
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,880
Ahead is a village called Ido.

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,060
You should be able to get water there.

31
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,660
Huh? You're not coming?

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,040
We sand pirates can't
go any further ahead.

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,660
This land belongs to the people

34
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,620
who've lived and died here
for generations, you see.

35
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,030
Is that how it is?

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,680
Yeah. The desert is the land of the free.

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
But not everyone can
survive in the harsh desert.

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,710
The village ahead is a place
where such people eke out a living.

39
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,460
So, what're you gonna do?

40
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,760
Nothing much!

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,550
We've freely lived as we pleased on this ocean
of sand, and that's what we'll keep on doing!

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,720
That's just like us, then!

43
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,140
Yeah? That's great!

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,810
--So long!
--Take care!

45
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,020
See ya, old umbrella guy!

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,980
--They were great guys!
--Yeah!

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,310
By the way, where'd your brother go?

48
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,980
Dunno. But he's Ace.
Nothing to worry about.

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,700
He'll suddenly show up
again out of nowhere!

50
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,260
Why do you keep making
such groundless claims?

51
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,710
Anyways, let's hurry to this Udo village!

52
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,800
--You mean Ido.
--Ido?

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
Yeah.

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,760
Th-That's a desert pirate flag!

55
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,220
Crap! I gotta tell Big Bro!

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Yes, you utterly are rebel army soldiers!

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,880
Ever since you and your
companions arrived, Camu-sama,

58
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,110
attacks on the village
have utterly stopped!

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,830
Yup! You'd have to be
pretty crazy to take us on!

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,120
Rest easy and leave it to us, Mayor!

61
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,200
Yes! You're utterly correct!

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,340
But word is the rebel army and the
royal army will be clashing soon.

63
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,150
Won't staying in a place
like this interfere with that?

64
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,760
No, we can't just leave a
place that lets us eat all we--

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,660
Nah, this is this, that is that!

66
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,810
We may be rebels, but we haven't
completely given up on the king!

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,800
Yes, we have utter faith
in the king as well,

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,530
so we were hoping things
could be handled carefully.

69
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,000
Say no more!

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,940
After careful consideration, we've
decided to keep you guys safe, too!

71
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,720
All we ask for in return
is booze and food!

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,150
Yes! Of course!

73
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,400
Well, I must be going now...

74
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,500
Big Bro Camu.

75
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Would giving up on the king
make us real rebel soldiers?

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,910
C'mon, get real.

77
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,910
We can't leave this village until
we've sucked all of its sweet nectar!

78
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,890
Big Bro! Terrible news, Big Bro!

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,570
What do you want?!
Pipe down, I'm trying to eat!

80
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,830
Sand pirates!
Sand pirates are attacking!

81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,000
For real?! What do we do?!

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,690
What do you mean?!
There's nothing we can do against them!

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,830
But we can't stick our tails
between our legs and run, either!

84
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,680
Tell us, Big Bro! What should we do?

85
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,190
Alright! Let's stick our tails
between our legs and run!

86
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,390
We're running away?!

87
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,830
But what happens after we run away?

88
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,850
Live on the edge of starvation again?

89
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,690
You moron! Staying alive is all that matters!

90
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,080
There are plenty of other villages like this!

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,900
Now let's scram!

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,660
That's for sure...

93
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,290
What're you?

94
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,620
You cowards got real guts to
call yourselves rebel soldiers.

95
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,960
If you ask me, it's a pretty despicable
thing for four grown men to do.

96
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,570
Who the hell're you?!
Mind your own business!

97
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,520
When did you get in here, anyway?!

98
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,390
Food thief!

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,480
More.

100
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,570
Yes, yes, yes! I'm sorry, sir!

101
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,220
This place has good food.

102
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,700
Yes, thank you!

103
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm sorry! I now realize
you're no ordinary person!

104
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,960
As you can see, we stand no
chance at all against sand pirates!

105
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,420
Please lend us your help!

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,540
Hmm. I'm not against the idea...

107
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,380
...but on one condition.

108
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,140
Yes! Anything you want!

109
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,580
Hey!

110
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,230
--Hey!
--Ace!

111
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,730
That's where he was?

112
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,910
What is this thing?

113
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,080
Oh! So you're the sand pirates?

114
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,520
Huh? What do you mean?
We just left the sand pirates.

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,120
Oh? Really? Well, whatever.

116
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Anyways, great news, Luffy!
I brought plenty of food and water!

117
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,540
Oh! Much appreciated!

118
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,560
This should be more than
enough for a good while!

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,700
Ace is incredible...

120
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,700
That's for sure! He's nothing like
a certain little brother we know!

121
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,680
You can say that again.

122
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,220
--I was so thirsty...
--Oh! Drink up, drink up!

123
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,640
Me too!

124
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,470
Umm, Ace-san?

125
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,230
I assume you don't have
the money for that.

126
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,190
Don't tell me you stole
it from that village...

127
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,360
Nothing of the sort!
The rebel army gave it to me!

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,550
The rebel army?!

129
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,970
Well, I should say "clearly fake
rebel soldiers" to be more precise.

130
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,080
--Eh?
--Fake? What do you mean?

131
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,600
Basically, they call
themselves rebel soldiers

132
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,840
and were hired to protect the village.

133
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,040
The villagers are so grateful that
they've been completely fooled.

134
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,280
They're really just some hoodlums.

135
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,930
And they're bodyguards?
Wouldn't they get found out right away?

136
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,100
Apparently, the mere
mention of the rebel army

137
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,260
will send most bandits running.

138
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,310
It's real convenient.

139
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,440
Makes money and prestige come
rolling your way on its own.

140
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,650
Rebel soldiers aren't hoodlums,
nor does the title serve as decoration.

141
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,080
Vivi-chan. Should we teach 'em a lesson?

142
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I dunno. Duping the villagers isn't
so different from what bandits do.

143
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,800
At the very least, the villagers
live in peace with them around.

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,920
Should we get 'em just the same?

145
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,930
But, big brother. Consider it
from Vivi-chan's perspective.

146
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,890
Surely you'd want to
pulverize people like them.

147
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,430
Yeah, she should do what she wants.
I only gave my own thoughts.

148
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,810
I don't want to hear your excuses!

149
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,730
I waited all alone in the
middle of this vast desert!

150
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,710
There's no reason to
cover for these bastards.

151
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,810
I'm not. I just know you
guys are in a hurry here...

152
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,910
Now that the kingdom can't keep
watch over every little place,

153
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,220
there's nothing wrong with
villages upholding public safety

154
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,800
on their own whenever possible.

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,460
Then...

156
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,180
No. I want to test them first.

157
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,430
--Test?
--Yes.

158
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,600
If these impostor rebel soldiers
truly wish to protect the villagers,

159
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,520
I don't think it matters
what they call themselves.

160
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,270
So you want to test what's
in their hearts, huh?

161
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,660
Yes. So, I hate to ask, but there's
something I'd like you all to do.

162
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,620
No sweat, Vivi-chan!

163
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,840
Alright! Things are
getting interesting now!

164
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,630
Eh? It's going to be interesting?!

165
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,360
Hold on, Luffy! This isn't
going to be a game! Understand?!

166
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
Yeah, I get it!

167
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,730
We're basically gonna beat these
fake rebel guys up, right?!

168
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
He doesn't understand a thing!
Someone do something about him!

169
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,360
He's been gone a long time.

170
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,050
It's been almost an hour since he said,
"Leave it to me!" and left...

171
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,030
You saw his strength!

172
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,510
I bet he's beating the
sand pirates up as we speak!

173
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,120
No, think about who he's fighting!

174
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,060
They might've beaten him
before he even got a chance!

175
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,640
In which case, we're next, huh?

176
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,660
No, I can't do this!

177
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,200
I hate to lose such good room and board...

178
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,450
...but staying alive is all that matters!

179
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,310
That's for sure.

180
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
--Good luck!
--We're counting on you!

181
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,120
--You can do it!
--Camu-sama!

182
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,820
Camu-sama! We're relying on you!

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,260
I was utterly about
to come calling for you,

184
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,860
but I should've known you already
knew the sea pirates were here!

185
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,780
Eh?! Sea pirates?!

186
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,070
Not sand pirates?!

187
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,920
That's correct. Sea pirates.

188
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,620
They're far more
ferocious than sand pirates.

189
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,840
Plus one is a special-edition pirate
with a 30 million-Berry bounty!

190
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,920
Once we heard you were going to go,
"Hiyaaah!" and get rid of them,

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,300
we were so utterly moved and grateful!

192
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,250
We know you can do it!

193
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,310
Good luck, mister!

194
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,080
Don't lose to some stupid sea pirates!

195
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm gonna get strong just like you!

196
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,170
Let's go!

197
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,160
H-Hey, Big Bro. Are you serious about this?

198
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,530
Don't be stupid. Of course he isn't serious.

199
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,160
Shut up, you guys!

200
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,500
Once we've left town, we run in
the opposite direction of the pirates!

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,980
We run to our last gasp!
What other way is there?!

202
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,500
That's for sure.

203
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,230
Dammit.

204
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,330
They're following us...

205
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,470
What a bunch of jerks...

206
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,760
Alright. We got one shot at this.

207
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,000
Once we're out, immediately figure
out which direction is pirate-free

208
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,280
and then run for your lives! Got it?!

209
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,710
Gotcha, loud and clear!

210
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,110
Here goes! One! Two! Three!

211
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,570
O-Oh, crap...

212
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,950
Get 'em, get 'em, rebel army!

213
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,030
Give that a rest, will ya?!

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,680
What's that?! You're a rebel soldier?!

215
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,990
N-No, nothing of the sort!
We're just travelers passing through!

216
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,910
Say your prayers, sea pirates!

217
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:37,480
These rebel soldiers are gonna
make mincemeat out of you!

218
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,390
Be quiet, you!

219
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,610
Right! How utterly rude of me!
Good luck, Camu-sama!

220
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,490
He seems especially spineless to me.

221
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,520
Doesn't seem reliable at all.

222
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,280
Yes...

223
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,860
Are you sure about this?

224
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,490
It might be best for the village
if we take care of them now.

225
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,120
A little more. Let's watch
things just a little more...

226
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,090
--Get 'em, rebel soldiers!
--You can do it!

227
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,250
Hey!

228
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,170
You really are rebel soldiers after all!

229
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,960
N-No, it isn't, uhh...

230
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,390
Wh-What now, Big Bro?

231
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,640
We lost our chance to escape...

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,180
Hey, you guys!

233
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,900
--Ace-sama?
--Please help...

234
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,940
This is your fight.

235
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,900
Try to get through it on your own.

236
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,320
We can't do that! We're fakes!

237
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
If you're men, act like it!

238
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,770
How long are you gonna keep
up this petty crap of yours?

239
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,500
What do we do, Big Bro?

240
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,240
Wh-What do you mean, what do we do?

241
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,720
We have no choice now but to lie
our way out of this, impostor-style!

242
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,220
Impostor-style?

243
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,680
Listen, you! Don't be shocked
by what I have to say!

244
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,020
We're not the only rebel soldiers here!

245
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,270
In the village there are...

246
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,190
...100 million more soldiers like us!

247
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,120
Oh, geez. That's worse than a kid's lie.

248
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,200
You're no one to talk.

249
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,140
What?! 100 million?!

250
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,080
Hold on, you!
That's not even believable!

251
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,140
He's obviously bluffing!

252
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,250
What?! It's a lie?!

253
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,370
Obviously!

254
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,590
--Oh, it was a lie?
--Oh, geez!

255
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,920
You! How dare you trick me?!

256
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,800
Damn! They realized I was lying!

257
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Did you really think
that would fool them?!

258
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,970
Gum-Gum Pistol!

259
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,230
What was that?!

260
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,110
He has Devil Fruit powers!

261
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,790
One hit knocked him out!

262
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,660
Not even rebel soldiers stand a
chance against something like that!

263
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,910
Luffy, you idiot! It's all
over if you knock him out!

264
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,250
Then what would we do?!

265
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,280
Big Brother Camu!

266
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,890
You can do it!

267
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,390
The sea pirate is coming!

268
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,630
--You can do it!
--Big Brother!

269
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,270
Stand up!

270
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,980
That's right...

271
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,250
When I was a kid, I looked up
to the warriors of Alabasta

272
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,330
and wanted to be as strong
as them someday...

273
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,290
No, even now I do...

274
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,020
Someday, I want to be as strong
as the warriors I saw as a child...

275
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,260
Someday...

276
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,600
How long are you gonna keep up
this petty crap of yours?

277
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,650
Big Bro!

278
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,150
Yes, we're fake rebel soldiers.

279
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,720
Even if all we want is to be as
strong as the heroes we saw as kids,

280
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,070
we're just a bunch of scoundrels now.

281
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,830
But, even if my dream never comes true,

282
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,660
I can't take those kids' dreams away!

283
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,930
Even if I'm no match for you,

284
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,860
I'm going to fight so that someday
those kids can beat you all!

285
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,650
If my only other choice is to remain
a punk in those kids' memories,

286
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,110
then I'd rather die as a hero right here!

287
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,040
Big Bro!

288
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,820
Bastard!

289
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,040
What's your deal?

290
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,260
I'll fight, too!

291
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,590
Your dream is my dream, Big Bro!

292
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,630
We've done all sorts of petty
things since we were kids,

293
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,810
but you were always there
to protect the weak, Big Bro!

294
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,540
Hyaaaa!

295
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,240
I-I'll always be there with you, Big Bro!

296
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,300
I'm gonna be a hero with you!

297
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,910
He's...

298
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,050
That's for sure!
What do we have to lose?!

299
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,920
I can show you my spirit, too!

300
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,380
Yeah! There's no running
away now, anyways!

301
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,550
Guys...

302
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,010
They're looking different now...

303
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,980
Though part of it seems because
their backs are to the wall...

304
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,990
Yes.

305
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,990
But I don't think they
could change like that

306
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,610
unless they're holding
something dear in their hearts.

307
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,690
Then... they're okay?

308
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:25,660
Yes. Let's go. We'll entrust
this place to them for now.

309
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,960
Hey! Retreat! Retreat!

310
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,170
Sea pirates or not, bring it on!

311
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Over my dead body will I let you
take one step into this village!

312
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,510
Yeah, now that's more like it!

313
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,970
Now I can go beat up
Crocodile without worrying!

314
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,600
Whew! What a relief!

315
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,390
Shut your trap and come on!

316
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,310
Those bastards!
Those are rebel soldiers for ya!

317
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,150
I've never seen such strong people before!

318
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,820
I suck at plays like this!

319
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,740
W-Wait for me!

320
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,860
Wh-What just happened?

321
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,710
Utterly well done, rebel soldiers!

322
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,440
--Hey, Luffy!
--Oh, Ace!

323
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,190
How long are we gonna run?!
The act's over by now, right?!

324
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,410
The way they abandoned
their lives was scary!

325
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,780
I see.

326
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,040
Protect her to the death, Sand-Sand Clan!

327
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,750
Bye, Vivi! Grow up to be a great princess!

328
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,940
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

329
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,030
I continue on to the ends of emotion

330
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:32,120
I scoop up my hands,

331
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,620
and the sand and time
that spills from them

332
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:45,630
show me that this is
what I was born to do

333
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:56,590
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

334
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:08,490
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

335
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,160
no one knows about

336
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,590
Say, Vivi. How are we going
to stop the rebel army?

337
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,760
When we get to Yuba,
I'll meet him-- Koza-- first.

338
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,080
--Koza?
--We just need to beat him up, right?!

339
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,850
--Please stop!
--Pay attention more!

340
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,600
Who is this Koza guy?

341
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,690
Koza is my friend, and the
leader of the rebel army!

342
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,540
On the next episode of One Piece!

343
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,060
"Rebel Warrior Koza!
The Dream Vowed to Vivi!"

344
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
