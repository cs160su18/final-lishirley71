00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,050
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,930
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,940
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,860
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,700
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

83
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,700
On top of that, he put prices
on the heads of Luffy and

84
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,320
11 others, and now they're being
hunted by all the citizens.

85
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,500
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

86
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,280
Luffy and Law are heading
to the Royal Palace!

87
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,550
Is everybody okay?!

88
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,770
We all came to save you!

89
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,890
Diaper Bombs!

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,850
Nipple Light Special!

91
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,730
Don't worry, long-nosed goblin man!
They were having trouble so...

92
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,320
I made a net for them!

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,030
Why did you do such a thing, you fool?!

94
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,780
--They're coming to get me!
--Was it unnecessary?!

95
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,080
Princess Mansherry, where are you?

96
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,620
There was a room...

97
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,260
There you are, Mansherry!

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,270
"Invincible!
A Gruesome Army of Headcracker Dolls!"

99
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,470
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE

100
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,850
Oh, those are...

101
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,050
...the Executives of the Doflamingo Family!

102
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,670
Watch out. Don't let them see you.

103
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,110
Okay!

104
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,470
We're almost at the Flower Field
on the fourth level!

105
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,360
If we can see Luffy and the others there,

106
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,730
we can hand over the key to Tra-guy-kun's cuffs.

107
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,440
I can... I can see Luffy-senpai soon!

108
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,910
Luffy-senpai!

109
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,520
Oh, Bartolomeo!

110
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,200
I've been waiting for you!

111
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,750
What? Y-You've been waiting for me?

112
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,700
L-Luffy-senpai has been waiting for me!

113
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,840
I can't help being emotional!

114
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,300
Hey, where are you going?

115
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,930
--What?
--Are you okay?

116
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,370
Y-Yes. I'm sorry to be late.

117
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,520
Well, I wasn't worried a bit.

118
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,600
What?

119
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,630
Because you're my friend!

120
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,200
F-Friend?!

121
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,560
Friend... Friend... Friend...

122
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,490
I don't care what happens anymore...

123
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,320
Why are you crying?

124
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,960
Never you mind.
It has to do with the treasure in my heart.

125
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,320
Everybody! You're getting so much better at using

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,200
the Tontatta Airlines' Jumping Service!

127
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,490
--Leo! Can you hear me?
--Yes, Viola-sama!

128
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,060
--I found Princess Mansherry!
--What?! Really?!

129
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,080
The Palace!
Princess Mansherry's in the Palace!

130
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,770
Great! Where in the Palace?

131
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,980
The small room at
the back of the chapel...

132
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,610
Remember?

133
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,450
--Chapel...
--The back...

134
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,430
A small...

135
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,210
...room?

136
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,470
I remember now!

137
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,750
The naughty room!

138
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,580
Yes! That's it!

139
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,690
What's wrong?

140
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,380
I just remembered Scarlet-sama.

141
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,630
Yeah...

142
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,550
My mother?

143
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,640
When we used to go to the Palace,

144
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,050
we were mischievous with Viola-sama

145
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,560
and got scolded by King Riku-sama!

146
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,530
He wants you to stay in here
and think about what you've done.

147
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,030
No! No! Let me out!

148
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,330
Not until King Riku-sama allows it!

149
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,750
What? But it's almost dinner time!

150
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,400
Until King Riku-sama permits it,
you can't eat!

151
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,320
Wait!

152
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,190
Viola-sama!

153
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,330
While Viola-sama is locked up,

154
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,230
we gotta think about what we've done
in this naughty room.

155
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,780
Leo! Cub! Inhel!

156
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,850
But it's good that we have each other!

157
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,360
--Why?
--It's sad to be all alone!

158
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,470
You're right! This room is bleak so...

159
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,570
But...

160
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,630
Oh, I'm hungry.

161
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,410
Yes...

162
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,210
--Big Sis!
--Scarlet-sama!

163
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,590
Did you get scolded again?
You never learn.

164
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,640
It's not my fault!
Leo and those two broke a plate!

165
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,310
You told us we could "break" it!

166
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,740
No! I said you could "touch" it!

167
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,290
Huh?!

168
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,190
I'll come and apologize with you later.

169
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,650
Really?!

170
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,800
Yes. Anyway, aren't you hungry?

171
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,180
We are!

172
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,930
Then, let's eat these together!

173
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,410
Thank you!

174
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,630
We all loved Scarlet-sama so much...!

175
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,090
Uh-huh!
She was always kind and gentle to us...

176
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,870
I still remember the naughty room well!

177
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,230
Thank you for the information!

178
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,460
The Palace is now the enemy's headquarters.

179
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,990
Be careful, Leo!

180
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,220
Roger that!
We'll save our princess at any cost!

181
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,250
Clank.

182
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,400
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE

183
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,940
THE THIRD LEVEL - LUFFY AND THE OTHERS

184
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,230
Alright! Those creepy dolls are gone!

185
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,430
Let's go!

186
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,150
Cabbage! Get on already!

187
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,310
Why're you guys getting on before me!

188
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,110
Dodge, Farul!

189
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,530
Horse!

190
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,340
Is it still alive?!

191
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,870
You bastard!

192
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,950
Gum-Gum Jet Pistol!

193
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,850
Farul!

194
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,250
Stay with me!

195
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,510
What a powerful jaw!
It crushed his head!

196
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,620
Don't die on me, Farul!

197
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,310
What the... I blew a hole in its stomach!

198
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,140
You monster!
How could you do this to Farul?!

199
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,960
Blade of Beauty! Round Table!

200
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,530
What?!

201
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,890
Are they invincible?!

202
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,750
Those toys...! Don't tell me...!

203
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,930
You...

204
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,530
I-It's humiliating for us samurai
to get hit on the head!

205
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,780
I'd rather take responsibility for providing

206
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,040
the enemies a net and commit hara-kiri!

207
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,760
You're such a pain!
I said I'd forgive you with just a few bruises!

208
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,270
Hold out, Kanjuro! Bear with it!

209
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,050
What you've done was that sinful!

210
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,940
But, Usopp-dono,
why should I get hit, too?

211
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,380
You two are collectively responsible.

212
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,880
Is that...

213
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,160
What's wrong?
You still looking for something, Viola?

214
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,100
Sugar is awake now!

215
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,640
What?!

216
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,520
Hey! What are you talking about?!
Sugar had been...

217
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,650
...completely knocked out
with my Special Facial Jack in the Box

218
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,860
and it seemed like
she wouldn't wake up for a couple days...

219
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,420
The Straw Hats and the others...
They don't know her, do they?!

220
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,870
Or her ability.

221
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,210
Sugar is totally recovered!
Straw Hat and the others are in danger!

222
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,350
What?!

223
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,220
What?

224
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:12,540
E-Everybody with a long nose, stay away!
Everyone with a long nose, drop dead!

225
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,560
What?! I thought you'd be hungry
so I brought...

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,560
...these.

227
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:17,910
What?!

228
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,430
They're just sausages.

229
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,580
Don't bring me stick-shaped things!

230
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,450
Snacks must be grapes!
Are you an idiot?!

231
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,540
Turn into a Headcracker Doll like the others and go fight!

232
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,820
I feel bad for Young Master-sama...

233
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,920
I'll turn everyone in this country...

234
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,630
...into toys again!

235
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,240
First, that damn, annoying long-nose
and his clan!

236
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,470
The Straw Hats!

237
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,300
If Sugar uses her ability,

238
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,860
the people and the soldiers of Dressrosa
will get turned into toys again!

239
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,680
Oh no!

240
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,900
Usopp-dono, is it that serious a problem?!

241
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,350
It sent chills down my spine

242
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,660
when I realized Robin had been turned into a toy, too, earlier!

243
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,580
I didn't even realize
I had forgotten about her!

244
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,420
If Sugar touches Luffy,
I'll forget about him like that!

245
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,470
Your friend disappears
and you won't even know it!

246
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,380
I can't take it!

247
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,140
That'll send chills down on
my spine, too...

248
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,470
I won't let that happen!

249
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,520
Can't we tell them through the Transponder Snail?

250
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,900
I've been calling them
but they haven't noticed!

251
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,690
The net-climbers are
getting pretty close, too!

252
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,950
Catch God Usopp and King Riku!

253
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,230
I have no option left now!

254
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,830
I'll shoot her from here!

255
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,210
But, Usopp-dono,
shooting her from this far is...

256
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,800
...impossible!

257
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,500
I can barely see the Palace
with my naked eye.

258
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,090
And the enemy is behind the wall.
I can't even see her!

259
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,970
No matter how tough, I gotta do it!

260
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,810
We'll assist you!

261
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,590
Yeah, if I fail, Sugar will put up her guard

262
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,250
and there will be no second chance!

263
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,150
It's gonna take a lot of precision
to get her with one shot for sure!

264
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,820
With your Clairvoyance,
tell me Sugar's location in detail!

265
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,910
Yes, count on me!

266
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,830
All right, now...

267
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,650
Help!

268
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,240
Halt!

269
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,830
About face!

270
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,780
Yes, sir!

271
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,830
Huh?! Why are we obeying him?!

272
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,240
Armsmorphosis!

273
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,150
Flying Disc Girl!

274
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,040
Humph! Bring it on!

275
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,150
I'll accept the onslaught from all of your techniques!

276
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,790
What?!

277
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,020
Did you say "I'll accept all of you"?

278
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,100
I, the former leader of the Happosui Army, will fight you!

279
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,650
You young squirt!

280
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,420
Don't call me "young squirt,"
you shit-bag twerp!

281
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,420
Shit-ba"g" twerp! There's the...

282
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,590
..."G"!

283
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,670
You called me a "shit-bag twerp"?!

284
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,400
They're...!

285
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,130
We're flying over the third level, Rebecca!

286
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,610
Yes, Robin-san!
The Flower Field is on the next level!

287
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:55,920
What?

288
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,990
Something's flying towards us
from below!

289
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,620
The real Straw Hats are beyond my imagination as I thought...

290
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,500
Rooster-kun, watch out!

291
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,130
Pop Baller!

292
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,260
Rooster-kun!

293
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,290
This is the Pop-Pop Fruit power!

294
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,270
Oh no! My Yellow Cubs...

295
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,990
Robin-san!

296
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,580
I can't believe there's a group
that is trying to get to the Palace like that!

297
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,990
It's Gladius!

298
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,330
Pop...

299
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,180
Diez Fleurs!

300
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,390
Rebecca, take the key to the Flower Field!

301
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,260
I'll be fine!

302
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,510
Robin-san!

303
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,390
Gum-Gum...

304
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,750
...UFO!

305
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,680
Dammit! If only I had the key to these cuffs,

306
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,330
I could take care of them all!

307
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,500
What? Something's falling from above!

308
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,860
Ouch!

309
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,190
I wasn't paying attention...

310
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,560
--Crest Head!
--That must be Luffy-senpai!

311
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,470
Cien Fleurs!

312
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,330
Wing!

313
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,150
Robin!

314
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,320
Luffy! Tra-guy-kun!
You guys are here!

315
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,740
Nico-ya, where's the key?!
Give it to me now!

316
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,390
--Rebecca has the key...
--What?!

317
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,670
She's heading for the Flower Field
on the fourth level!

318
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,360
Rebecca...

319
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
She got away...

320
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,430
Well, she's just one little tramp.

321
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,680
I know she can't do anything
even if she can get to the Palace.

322
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,100
I'll go after her and kill her later.

323
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,980
You bastard!

324
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,940
It's you!

325
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,060
My name is Gladius.

326
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,570
I'm gonna take care of you all first.

327
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,820
--Leave them in my hands.
--Yeah!

328
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
What?

329
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,460
Luffy! Tra-guy-kun!
And Soldier-san, too!

330
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,830
Just go now!
To the Flower Field on the fourth level!

331
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,750
That's right!

332
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,670
Robin?!

333
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,290
Rebecca's waiting for you!
Just go!

334
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,880
Okay.

335
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,060
Got it!

336
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,090
Clashing fiercely with Fujitora,
Sabo tries to figure out the admiral's true motive!

337
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,910
Meanwhile, Robin, Bartolomeo, and Cavendish,
placing their hopes in Luffy,

338
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,030
stand against Gladius' vicious attacks with their all their might

339
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,020
and clear the path for taking down Doflamingo!

340
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,380
On the next episode of One Piece!

341
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,230
"Risking Their Lives! Luffy is the Trump Card for Victory!"

342
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,370
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
