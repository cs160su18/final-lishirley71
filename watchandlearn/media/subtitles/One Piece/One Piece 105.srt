00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:19,080
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,650
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,310
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,850
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,020
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,400
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,520
To stop the maelstrom of war
spreading throughout Alabasta,

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,070
Princess Vivi was in a rush
to talk with the rebel army.

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,400
However...

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,120
I wanna kick Crocodile's ass!

31
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,090
If we stop the people rebelling,
will that stop Crocodile?

32
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,950
At least try putting all of our
lives on the line together!

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,600
Aren't we friends?!

34
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,060
Now tell me...

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,290
...where Crocodile is!

36
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,200
It was at this moment
that Vivi made up her mind.

37
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,030
"The Battlefront of Alabasta!
Rainbase, the City of Dreams"

38
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,720
Everyone...

39
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,410
Luffy-san is exactly right.
I've made up my mind now.

40
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,760
Let's go to where Crocodile is!

41
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,740
Yeah!

42
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,520
That does seem to be
the quickest shortcut.

43
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,470
Meaning no more of this
annoying, roundabout traveling.

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,850
So, where is this damn Crocodile?

45
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,160
Let's see here...

46
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,610
This is the capital city of Alubarna,
where my father rules from.

47
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,080
And the rebel army is currently here,
preparing to invade Alubarna.

48
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,030
So we need to take care of
Crocodile before that can happen.

49
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,490
Crocodile is here. Rainbase.

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
Rainbase...

51
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,770
It's about a day's journey north of here.

52
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,570
C'mon, I told you to
quit moaning, you two!

53
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,710
Who're you to say anything
when you're riding the camel?!

54
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,650
Yeah! Let us ride, too!

55
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,080
You camel-woman!

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,980
Nami-mel!

57
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,640
Good one!

58
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,490
Chopper! You haven't collapsed today!

59
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,940
Yeah. I'm gonna try extra hard.

60
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,090
Vivi. Does Rainbase have water?

61
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,590
Yes, there's no problem there.

62
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,300
It's a gambling town, almost
completely detached from the rebellion.

63
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,740
Ooh! Gambling?!

64
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,700
Hey, now! What're you thinking?!

65
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,180
I guess even here in Alabasta
there are carefree cities.

66
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,050
Gum-Gum No Way!

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,690
No! No! No!

68
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,890
Gimme some!

69
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,180
Gum-Gum No Way!

70
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,090
C'mon! Just one sip!
That is why we have it!

71
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,430
That dry old guy spent all
night digging this water up!

72
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,280
We can't just drink it like
it's nothing! You dumbhead!

73
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,570
Wow! Sometimes you
can restrain yourself!

74
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,830
Of course I can! How rude!

75
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,540
You're rude!

76
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,020
Can't take another step... W-Water...

77
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,260
So?! How long until Rainbase?!

78
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,180
Luffy-san.

79
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,390
Thanks. I never would've been able
to make this decision on my own.

80
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,220
Then gimme food.

81
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,810
Eh?

82
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,640
After I kick Crocodile's ass,
gimme so much food I might die!

83
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,360
Okay! I promise!

84
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,270
"Rebel Army Camp in Katorea"

85
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,170
Please, Koza! Let me join the rebel army!

86
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,530
No.

87
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,750
Why not?! I have the right to
join the rebellion too, don't I?!

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,520
I despise the king! Let me fight with you!

89
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,670
Show him, Faracla.

90
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,260
He got this trying to protect me
in the middle of a battle.

91
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,560
Would you like to see the
medical wards and the graves too?

92
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,070
T-That doesn't scare me!

93
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,920
Towns've dried up, and many have
died 'cause the king stole the rain!

94
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,860
It made lots of my friends sick, too!

95
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,610
It's all the king's fault!

96
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,050
I wanna fight, too!

97
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,850
I'm not afraid of getting hurt or even dying!

98
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,520
Then leave. Our opinions are too different.

99
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
We're all afraid, and none
of us want to fight.

100
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,180
Then why do you fight?!

101
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,350
It's not that we wanted to. We had to.

102
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,530
That's what the country wished for.

103
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,860
Whether you understand or not,
it has nothing to do with you.

104
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,990
Leave.

105
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,980
I said leave, dammit!
This is no place for children!

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,060
What was that about, Koza?

107
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,460
It's not like you to rant
and rave at children.

108
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,530
It was like looking at my
old self. It made me mad.

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,480
I haven't changed one bit...

110
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,760
Have we gathered enough weapons?

111
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,910
No, it's proving difficult...

112
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,870
Contact all the other towns.

113
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
As soon as we have weapons,

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,690
we launch an all-out assault on Alubarna!

115
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,330
Sire! It's only a matter of time until
the rebel army attacks Alubarna!

116
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,800
We must take action first,
before it's too late!

117
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,760
Silence! I told you no!

118
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,690
This is not a children's quarrel!
Is retaliation what you want?!

119
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,140
But, Sire! The country's
existence hangs in the balance!

120
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,160
So what?

121
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,800
Ever since the Dance Powder
incident, it has been clear

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,590
that someone is trying
to destroy our country!

123
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,970
Are you suggesting
we destroy our countrymen

124
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,650
before learning who's
really pulling the strings?

125
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,940
That would be the downfall of our country!

126
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,880
Listen! A country is its people!

127
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,880
However, this wire-puller has
not shown himself whatsoever!

128
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,620
Taking action after this unknown
shadow devours our country

129
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,310
would be too late, Sire!

130
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,220
No. Please understand.

131
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,190
The king won't allow us
to take the offensive.

132
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,360
We can barely even appease
the soldiers at this point.

133
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,090
If only Igaram-san were
here at a time like this...

134
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,750
Igaram says he's leaving
the country for a while?

135
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,810
As we speak, he and Vivi-sama

136
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,570
are probably still hard at work,
trying to figure out who's behind this.

137
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,170
I wonder where they are.

138
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,990
Chaka-sama! Pell-sama!

139
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,800
What is it?!

140
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,590
Karoo has returned!

141
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,750
Karoo has?!

142
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,600
Sire! Who is that letter from?!

143
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,660
It's Vivi's handwriting, without a doubt...

144
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,030
Sire! Does that mean--?!

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,500
Karoo came to deliver
a letter from Vivi-sama?!

146
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,870
Father. Everything written
here is true. It is fact.

147
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,210
The person trying to bring
suffering and ruin to this kingdom

148
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,430
is none other than Crocodile!

149
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,350
Igaram is another who has
fallen at the hands of Crocodile.

150
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,780
Crocodile! I stupidly believed
he worked for the government!

151
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,320
I never would've imagined he
was trying to usurp this kingdom!

152
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,050
Igaram-san...

153
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,740
He gave his life for
Vivi-sama and this land...

154
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,730
And now, there are people who
have given me unfathomable power.

155
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,880
If I continue with them, we may
make a difference in this kingdom.

156
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,540
The light of hope is here!
Alabasta will be saved!

157
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,750
Please have faith, Father!

158
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,060
Vivi.

159
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,190
It says you fought valiantly,
too, Karoo. You've done well.

160
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,030
You're hurt? Let me see.

161
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,900
At any rate, no matter what happens,

162
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,010
this thing on our left arm
is the sign of our friendship!

163
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,460
Chaka.

164
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,420
We know the enemy's identity!
Prepare the soldiers for expedition!

165
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,730
I will not let Vivi's resolve
and Igaram's death be for naught!

166
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,620
We're taking immediate action!

167
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,950
We're heading to Rainbase,
where Crocodile is!

168
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,880
Please wait, Sire! Rainbase is
too far away to be "immediate"!

169
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,890
Crocodile has the citizens on his side!

170
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,060
Even more so than you,
with all due respect...

171
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,300
If we attack Rainbase,

172
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,540
the rebel army will use that as
a chance to storm the palace!

173
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,360
And if that happens--!

174
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,050
So what if the rebel army
destroys this palace?!

175
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,680
I've told you before! A country is its people!

176
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,390
Even if our royal army falls,
as long as Crocodile is defeated,

177
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,900
the country will be reborn by the people!

178
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,850
But, consider if we clash
with the rebel army instead!

179
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,100
Crocodile is the only one
who will have the last laugh!

180
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,050
Sire...

181
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,920
You're that dedicated to--?

182
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,330
Even if by some chance
the rebel army doesn't stop,

183
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,570
we need only take out Crocodile!

184
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,240
We're up against one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

185
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,850
Crocodile is not weak of heart.

186
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,200
This battle will not be without
sacrifices before its end.

187
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,220
Chaka! I'm holding a war meeting!
Assemble the officers!

188
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,560
Pell! Go on ahead and
conduct enemy reconnaissance!

189
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,120
Yes, Sire!

190
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,860
It seems we've been severely
underestimating His Majesty.

191
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,590
What powerful spirit!

192
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,570
We go to battle tomorrow morning!

193
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes, Sire!

194
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,240
I'm sending all soldiers to Rainbase!

195
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,880
I see it...

196
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,650
Is that it?

197
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,180
Rainbase?

198
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,290
Oh! Are we here?!

199
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,760
Crocodile!

200
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,010
Alright! Time to beat up Crocodile!

201
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,850
So this is Rainbase!

202
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,370
By the way, does Baroque Works
know we're in this country now?

203
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,370
Most likely.

204
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,250
We did run into Mr. 2, so we should
assume they know we're here.

205
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,840
So what?!

206
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,640
They know what we look like!

207
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,750
We can't do much of anything
while we're in Rainbase!

208
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,000
Why not?!

209
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,920
If we get spotted first,

210
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,220
Crocodile can probably deal
with us in all kinds of ways.

211
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,430
Assassination is their area of specialty.

212
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,090
Come out, Crocodile!

213
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,490
Were you even listening?!

214
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,860
In any case, no matter who we run into,

215
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,170
I'll protect Nami-san and Vivi-chan!

216
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,370
You two girls can call me "Prince"!

217
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,700
Prince.

218
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,320
Don't make me kick your ass!

219
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,790
Prince... Water...

220
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,790
Water...

221
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,840
Shut up, you guys!

222
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,650
Water! Need water!

223
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,090
Me too!

224
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,250
Water! Water!

225
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
Wait! Luffy!

226
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,090
Take money with you!

227
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,300
Captain Smoker.

228
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,500
Why do you think the Straw Hats
will show up here, in Rainbase?

229
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,450
Dunno. Call it a hunch.

230
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,670
Alright!

231
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,290
We can get water here, Usopp!

232
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,290
Water!

233
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,440
Plus, something stinks about this country.

234
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,350
I get a strong sense that something
big is lurking in the shadows.

235
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,350
Old lady! Water!

236
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,390
A barrel of water! No, five!
Five barrels of water!

237
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,390
Then you think there
really is a connection

238
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,410
between the Baroque Works criminal
organization and Straw Hat?

239
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,600
Here!

240
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Water!

241
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,360
All I know is that Straw Hat
is out to get Crocodile...

242
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,770
...one of the Seven Warlords.

243
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,580
This water's great, you jerk!

244
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,010
It's great, you bastard!

245
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,870
Let's hurry and take the others some!

246
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,590
I need to take a leak.

247
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,270
Can we really count on them?

248
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,180
They can do little errands
just fine. Don't worry.

249
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,840
I dunno. I bet they'll come back
with a bunch of trouble again.

250
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,550
I'd do warm-up exercises if I were you.

251
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,980
--Run!
--Yeah!

252
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,650
--Run!
--Yeah!

253
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,530
Got that barrel?!

254
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,180
Yeah!

255
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,010
Damn it!

256
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,150
We're going after 'em, Tashigi!
Gather the marines!

257
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,630
Yes, sir!

258
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,350
Umm, how much do I owe you?

259
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,080
If you know those kids, you better
pay for the water they took, too!

260
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,490
Y-Yes! I'm sorry for the trouble!

261
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,990
Why is the Navy here again?!

262
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,070
How should I know?! Just run!

263
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,870
The Navy's chasing 'em again!

264
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,270
No way!

265
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,550
So why are they running this way?!

266
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,650
Say! Tony-kun hasn't come back yet!

267
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,960
Leave him! He'll manage!

268
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,730
Hey, guys! The Navy's here!

269
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,900
You're the one bringing them here!

270
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,720
Catch 'em for sure this time!

271
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,640
They're quick to run away, I'll give 'em that!

272
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,180
This isn't a good idea!

273
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,910
Baroque Works is gonna spot us...

274
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,740
...if we run through the city!

275
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,010
I think it's too late for that.

276
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,950
Then it's decided! Let's go!

277
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,570
Eh?!

278
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,330
To where Crocodile is!

279
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,050
Right, Vivi?!

280
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,190
Yes! Do you see that
alligator-roof building up ahead?!

281
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,160
That's the casino Crocodile runs...

282
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,590
Raindinners!

283
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,880
There, huh?!
So that's where Crocodile is?!

284
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,260
It'd be best if we split up!

285
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,690
It looks that way!

286
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,940
Alright! See you later!

287
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,010
Yeah!

288
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,190
Let's meet at the alligator house!

289
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,300
They split up!

290
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,460
Don't let 'em escape!

291
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,410
Come and get me, Smokey!

292
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,730
You got real guts!

293
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,050
Don't think you can keep running forever!

294
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,200
White Vine!

295
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,820
Gum-Gum...

296
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,000
...Balloon!

297
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,480
That was close!

298
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,390
Damn!

299
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,160
Ahh! Much better!

300
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,980
Where did everyone go?

301
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
That's Luffy's smell!

302
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,320
That's Zoro's smell!

303
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
Sanji's goes that way!

304
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,800
What's going on?!

305
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,660
Outta the way!

306
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,500
Whoops!

307
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,510
Mr. Bushido! This direction, too!

308
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,370
It's them! No doubt about it!

309
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,300
Kill 'em!

310
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,670
The Baroque Works Millions!

311
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,080
"Stuck between the devil
and the deep sea," huh?

312
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,930
Go on without me!

313
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,340
Hurry!

314
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,380
R-Right!

315
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,230
Usopp!

316
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,720
Look after Nami-san!

317
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,860
What?!

318
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,370
I'll hold 'em off!

319
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,160
Alright! You can count on me!

320
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,800
Sanji-kun...

321
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Go!

322
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,230
We are!

323
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,110
Without that smoke freak around,
they're just small fries.

324
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,470
My deepest condolences.

325
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,750
I hope Mr. Bushido will be all right!

326
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,070
Is that all you got?
Try again some other time.

327
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,950
Roronoa Zoro! We meet again!

328
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,950
That voice...

329
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,330
I've been looking for you for a long time!

330
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,170
What do you think you're doing,
cutting down regular citizens?!

331
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,590
Look, I got my own circumstances, too!

332
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,510
Besides, I have no desire to fight you!

333
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,010
We settled our match in Loguetown!

334
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,580
We did not!

335
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,500
I haven't even laid a single blow yet!

336
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,340
She looks like her! Way too much like her!

337
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,000
And quit it with that face, will ya?!

338
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,770
C-Come again?! Are you trying
to ridicule me yet again?!

339
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,150
You will pay for this!

340
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,780
Dammit! She's the one
person I can't deal with!

341
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,100
Wait!

342
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,940
Bastards! Get back here!

343
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,380
No!

344
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,860
It's definitely them!

345
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,430
W-We did it!

346
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,630
Way to go, Usopp!

347
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,260
Look! Up ahead!
The entrance to Raindinners!

348
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,580
It's in the middle of a lake!

349
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,360
Is no one here yet?!

350
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,310
Alright! Let's blast 'em!

351
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,850
Start with those two!

352
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,360
The enemy?!

353
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,240
Zoro!

354
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,540
Wasn't Vivi with you?!

355
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,980
Yeah! Is she not here yet?!

356
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,790
She might've gone inside!

357
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,380
Let's hurry, then!

358
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,090
Luffy!

359
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,930
Get back here!

360
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,940
Plume-Plume is with him!

361
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,760
Hey! Let's go! Run inside, guys!

362
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,900
We're going in?

363
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,740
He's in there...

364
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,770
...isn't he?!

365
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,180
Oh? Vivi and the pirates
are here in town?

366
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,420
Yes. We just received
word from the Millions.

367
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,830
Go welcome the foolish rats.

368
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,890
Yes, sir.

369
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,030
Listen, Crocodile!
I'm going to kick your ass!

370
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm coming for you!

371
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

372
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,990
I continue on to the ends of emotion

373
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:38,630
I scoop up my hands, and the sand
and time that spills from them

374
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:45,670
show me that this is what
I was born to do

375
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:57,820
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

376
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:08,460
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

377
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,670
no one knows about

378
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,520
Crocodile! Come out! I came
to Alubarna to kick your ass!

379
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,990
That's not gonna make him
come out! You're so dumb!

380
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,960
We're up against the kingdom's hero!

381
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,920
Are you gonna make these
customers our enemies too?!

382
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,990
But without Vivi,
we don't know who Crocodile is!

383
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,500
Huh? Come to think of it, where is Vivi?

384
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,800
On the next episode of One Piece!

385
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,000
"The Trap of Certain Defeat!
Storming Raindinners"

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,270
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
