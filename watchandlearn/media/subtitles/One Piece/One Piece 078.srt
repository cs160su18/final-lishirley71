00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,670
Straight ahead!

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,750
What are you talking about?!
We've already been eaten!

23
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,270
Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

24
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,920
Hakoku Sovereignty!

25
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,300
"Nami's Sick?
Beyond the Snow Falling on the Sea!"

26
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,610
We're flying out of it!

27
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,260
Don't look back!
We're going straight ahead!

28
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,050
Huge! It's so huge!

29
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,560
They cut... the very sea itself...

30
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,080
This is the strength of Elbaf warriors!

31
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,710
Incredible!

32
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,560
Friends!

33
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,360
Now go!

34
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,910
Long ago, there were ruffians on the sea

35
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,310
known as the Giant Warrior Pirates.

36
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,650
The two pirate bosses,

37
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,520
Red Ogre Broggy and Blue Ogre Dorry,

38
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,070
were exceptionally strong.

39
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,020
They were left mostly unchecked,

40
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,090
for ordinary people no longer
stood a chance against them.

41
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,090
But they say that the one who
put an end to their attacks...

42
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,690
...was a single little girl.

43
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,540
You see what our bosses caught today?!

44
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,850
Yeah! It's stuck in my mind!
My excitement won't stop!

45
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,640
Each one of 'em bagged an
insanely huge Sea King, after all!

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,990
Even though we're Elbaf giants,

47
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,320
nobody can take down those
jumbo-sized beasts except for our bosses!

48
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,840
Right, men?!

49
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah!

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,100
You got that right!

51
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,840
Those ones were definitely
the biggest ones...

52
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,850
Yeah! The biggest ones
we've ever caught!

53
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,690
So which one was bigger?

54
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,700
Which...

55
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,890
...one?

56
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,070
Yeah! Who won the hunting contest?

57
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,740
Look, Broggy! Mine is slightly bigger!

58
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,170
You wish! Mine's a whole
3 centimeters bigger!

59
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,400
Say what?!

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,410
What's your problem?!

61
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,500
Bosses! Please stop!

62
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,880
Incidentally, Broggy. There's one
thing I can't seem to remember.

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,650
No, actually, that goes for me, too.

64
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,610
Middle Mountain!

65
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,000
No matter! Let's just finish this now!

66
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,850
Yeah! We can think things
through after that!

67
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,160
Guys! Someday, I will go to Elbaf!
To the village of warriors!

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,640
Yeah! Okay!

69
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,860
♪ Gi-Gi-Giants! Gi-Giants! ♪

70
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,740
♪ Elbaf-baf! Elbaf-baf! ♪

71
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,530
♪ Everyone's huge!
'Cause they're giants! ♪

72
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,170
♪ They're huge!
They're huge! They're huge! ♪

73
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,370
They sure are full of energy...

74
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,210
I'm suddenly exhausted after
everything that's happened.

75
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,290
Vivi. Could you watch
this compass for me?

76
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,080
Sure.

77
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,650
Now you can finally return to Alabasta.

78
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,310
Well, assuming we can make
it there safely, of course...

79
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,490
Yes. I must return!

80
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,320
After all, I'm...

81
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,780
...the only way to
save the kingdom, Princess!

82
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,920
The king-- your father-- no longer
has sway with the people now.

83
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Our only hope of
stopping this uprising now

84
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,750
is for you to tell the
people the truth directly!

85
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,780
So, no matter what, you must not die!

86
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,860
You must live on, even if it
means losing those near to you

87
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,970
or having to betray others!

88
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,590
It will be painful!

89
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,060
Princess Vivi!
Are you prepared not to die?

90
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,540
I will return to Alabasta, alive...

91
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,530
There's no need to push
yourself so hard, Vivi-chan.

92
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,440
You have me!

93
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,060
Today's relaxing sweets.
How about some petit fours?

94
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,670
For drinks, you have your
choice of coffee or tea...

95
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,120
Sanji-san...

96
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,910
Yours is in the kitchen!

97
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,080
Alright!

98
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,570
I'm first!

99
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,840
2,603!

100
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,240
2,604!

101
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,830
2,605!

102
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,150
2,606!

103
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,400
If only I could've cut that wax...

104
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,470
...I wouldn't have left anyone hanging...

105
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,620
I'm weak...

106
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,200
If I'm gonna get stronger...

107
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,680
...I need to be able to cut up
stuff like that from any stance!

108
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,550
"Alabasta Kingdom
Sandy Island"

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,510
Mr. 2! Bon Clay-sama!
The Swanda is ready to set sail!

110
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,410
Okay, okay! You're so loud, sheesh!

111
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,480
Honestly, now! Why do I have to do this?!

112
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,440
Mr. 3 is nothing but bulky garbage!
You guys go toss him out!

113
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,310
W-We can't!

114
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,440
We wouldn't stand a chance,
even if we ganged up on him!

115
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,550
P-Please! It is the boss' orders!

116
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,670
Un, deux, trois...

117
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,660
What's "four" called?

118
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,300
"Bon Clay"

119
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,250
Zero-chan is so high-maintenance...

120
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,600
Vivi... Sorry. I think I'm gonna...

121
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,050
...go lie down...

122
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,980
No problem, Nami-san!

123
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,520
I'll keep an eye on our course.
You should get some rest.

124
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,530
Are you all right?!

125
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
Everyone, come here! This is bad!

126
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,820
Huh? What is it, Vivi?

127
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,080
Nami-san has a terrible fever!

128
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,670
Eh?! Nami-san does?!

129
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,300
Is Nami-san gonna die? Is she, Vivi-chan?

130
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,720
It's most likely the climate.

131
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,910
One of the obstacles all sailors
who enter the Grand Line run into

132
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,720
is illness caused by abnormal weather.

133
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,880
There are countless stories
of tough, notorious pirates

134
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,410
suddenly dying from this.

135
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,280
Carelessness makes even
the slightest case deadly.

136
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,910
Nami-san!

137
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,380
Is there anyone on this ship with
any medical knowledge at all?

138
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,310
But eating meat makes
sickness go away! Right, Sanji?

139
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,760
I can make some basic food
meant for sick people,

140
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,930
but that's entirely
in "nursing" territory.

141
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,890
There's no guarantee
it'd make her better...

142
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,050
Besides, I normally put
100 times more care

143
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,240
into Nami-san and Vivi-chan's
meals than I do with yours...

144
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,880
I serve them fresh meat and
vegetables, for balanced nutrition.

145
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,040
And I give all the
rotting stuff to you guys.

146
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Hey, now!

147
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,010
It's still good, though!

148
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,050
In any case, as long
as I'm this ship's cook,

149
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,380
there'll be no problems whatsoever
in terms of getting a balanced diet.

150
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,360
But there are different kinds
of meals for sick people.

151
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,210
What are her symptoms? What does
she need? I can't make that call...

152
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,850
Then she can just eat it all!

153
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,320
She's sick because she doesn't
have the energy for that!

154
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,890
40°C?! Her fever's gone up again!

155
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,250
There'll be doctors when
we get to Alabasta, right?!

156
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,120
How much longer will it take, Vivi?

157
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,860
I don't know, but one week
is out of the question...

158
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,530
Is being sick that bad?

159
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,240
Dunno. Never been sick...

160
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,880
Who in the world are you guys?!

161
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,340
Of course it's bad!
40°C fevers don't happen every day!

162
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,040
This may be a life-threatening illness...

163
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,180
Nami's gonna die?!

164
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,070
Don't die, Nami-san!

165
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,730
Stop that! Be quiet!

166
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,310
Let's find a doctor to help Nami!

167
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,780
Okay! Just calm down!

168
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,530
You're going to make
her illness even worse!

169
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,300
No.

170
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,370
No.

171
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,900
Nami-san?

172
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,570
Oh! She's all better!

173
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,340
Get real!

174
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,830
In my desk drawer...
there's a newspaper...

175
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,380
No change in course...

176
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
N-No!

177
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,970
That can't be!

178
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,120
Hey. What is it?

179
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,200
Is it about Alabasta, Vivi-chan?

180
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,480
300,000 royal soldiers
defected to the Resistance...

181
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,530
It was originally a cold war,

182
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,140
with 600,000 royal soldiers and
400,000 Resistance soldiers...

183
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,250
But now that's suddenly changed!

184
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,110
The uprising in Alabasta is
finally going to get serious now...

185
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,570
That paper's from three days ago...

186
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,610
I'm sorry. We can't change our speed,

187
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,050
so I didn't want to worry
you by showing you that...

188
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,520
Understand, Luffy?

189
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,230
Things seem very bad!

190
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,130
Whew, that got through to
you more than I expected...

191
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,470
But you need to see a doctor!

192
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,670
I'm fine... That thermometer
must be broken...

193
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,610
Nobody gets a temperature of 40°C...

194
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,990
It's probably just
sunstroke or something...

195
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,230
We don't need a doctor.
I'll get better on my own...

196
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,320
For now, let's head straight
for Alabasta as planned!

197
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,770
Thanks for worrying about me.

198
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,690
Oh! She's better now?

199
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,960
You idiot. She's just acting tough.

200
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,680
At this rate, so much blood will
be shed throughout the kingdom.

201
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,930
It'll be an all-out war...

202
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,970
If I don't stop that,
the Alabasta Kingdom will be done for!

203
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,370
Crocodile will take over!

204
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,420
I can't just return safely!

205
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,360
I need to return as quickly as possible!

206
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,830
If I don't make it in time,

207
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,730
a million citizens will
kill themselves pointlessly!

208
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,510
There's a million people?!

209
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,020
What an immense burden
you're carrying, Vivi-chan...

210
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,730
Urgh! What were you
watching all this time?!

211
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,640
Whadya talking about?
The ship's been going straight.

212
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,870
Yeah, straight at a right angle!
Look at the compass!

213
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,910
I don't need to.
I was watching that big cloud there.

214
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,380
Clouds move and change shape!

215
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,340
Oh, geez, my head's killing me...

216
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,790
So just leave this to me and go to bed!

217
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,980
I'm here because
I can't leave this to you!

218
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,800
The air's changed...

219
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,890
The air? It's been nice
weather this whole time.

220
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,940
Never mind! Just get the others!

221
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,970
Hey! Get out here, you guys!
Got work to do!

222
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,780
What?

223
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,160
Huh? Hard to feel motivated
when you're giving the orders.

224
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,180
Just shut up and move!

225
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,620
Take the seat and
catch the portside wind!

226
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,620
What's going on, Nami-san?

227
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,820
The waves are quiet,
and the weather's nice...

228
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,370
Wind...

229
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,660
Wind?

230
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,000
An immense wind...
is coming directly this way...

231
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,350
I think.

232
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,060
What?

233
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,630
Hot!

234
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,790
You're hot! Yeah, you stay inside
the ship! Let's go to a doctor!

235
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,250
Mind your own business!
This is my normal temperature!

236
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,100
Now quit being stupid and pull the ropes!

237
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,150
Nami-san. I know you're
saying that for Vivi-chan,

238
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,960
but if you push too hard...

239
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,570
I told you, I'm fine!

240
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,270
Hey, Nami. I think you really should--

241
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,260
Just hurry and move the ship!

242
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,410
Sheesh...

243
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,130
What could it be?

244
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,870
It seems a little different than a storm...

245
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,390
I need to hurry back to Alabasta...

246
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,870
I have a favor to ask, everyone!

247
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
I know it's not my place to ask
this as a passenger on your ship,

248
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,940
but my homeland is in a terrible state now,

249
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,880
so I'd like to hurry ahead!

250
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,220
We can't waste even a single minute!

251
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,350
So I want this ship to head for
Alabasta at its fastest speed!

252
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,850
Of course! That's what we promised!

253
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,890
So let's find an island with
a doctor on it right away!

254
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,240
Let's cure Nami-san as quickly as
possible and then go to Alabasta!

255
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,890
That's this ship's fastest speed, right?!

256
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,390
Yeah! We can't go any faster than that!

257
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,150
Are you sure?

258
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,270
As their princess, you should be
worried about those million citizens.

259
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,690
That's right! So we need to hurry
and cure Nami-san's illness!

260
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,160
Well said, Vivi-chan!
I've fallen for you all over again!

261
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,210
You got guts.

262
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,850
Thanks...

263
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,440
Don't overexert yourself, Nami-san!

264
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,280
Sorry, Vivi... I think...
I am kind of... in trouble...

265
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,840
Nami-san! Hang in there!

266
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,550
What is that?!

267
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,050
It's a cyclone!

268
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,550
It's huge!

269
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,260
W-Wait! That's the direction--

270
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,130
That's the direction our
ship was just headed in!

271
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,690
It would've been a direct hit
had we kept going straight!

272
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,310
Yikes! We just barely made it through!

273
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,010
Incredible!

274
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,990
Grand Line cyclones are said
to be impossible to predict!

275
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,020
Yet, she--

276
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,440
She doesn't predict weather
based on standard theory...

277
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,500
It's almost as if she's detecting
the weather with her body!

278
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,470
I've never seen such a navigator before!

279
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,450
Alright! Let's hurry, then!

280
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,560
Let's go find us a doctor!

281
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,630
Yeah!

282
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,000
What do we do, Vivi-chan?!
Nami-san's fever won't go down!

283
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,700
Sanji-san! Karoo!
I asked you to stop freaking out!

284
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,170
See any doctors?!

285
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,040
Do you expect him to, you idiot?

286
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,690
Hey, guys. Do you think
people can stand on the ocean?

287
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,810
Can people stand on the ocean?

288
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,650
C'mon, Zoro. What kind of question is that?

289
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,990
Then... what's that?

290
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,300
Huh?

291
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,560
What's what?

292
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,040
Huh?!

293
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

294
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

295
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

296
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

297
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,420
So even...

298
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,630
...if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

299
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,840
the ship will continue forward

300
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,940
Bon voyage!

301
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget about them!

302
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,950
I know I'm a fool, but I gotta go

303
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,620
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

304
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,290
I know I'm a fool, but I'm gonna fight

305
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,300
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

306
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,570
Do everything you can, and you'll
get a little nearer to any horizon

307
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,520
Oh, Nami-san!

308
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,320
Forgive me for not being
able to lower your fever!

309
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,890
You need to cool your head off!
Look around!

310
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,620
The ship's being attacked right now.

311
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,490
What do we do?! What do we do?!

312
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,960
Oh, that's it? Nothing's worse
than Nami-san being sick!

313
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,230
Whoa! He's eating our ship!

314
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

315
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,470
"A Raid! Tin Tyrant
and Tin Plate Wapol"

316
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
