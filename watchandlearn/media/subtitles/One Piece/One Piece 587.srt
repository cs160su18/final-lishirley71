00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,520
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,710

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,680
Being brazen, is it a crime?

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,810
Freedom is our only rule

jiyuu dakega ore tachi no ruuru

31

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830
It’s important not to wake up

39
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,850
We won’t left anyone behind

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,570
the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

57
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,320
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,580
The sun of my heart will never set

61
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

62

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,540

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the second half of the Grand Line.

69
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

70
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,960
The New World has ruined many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,290
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

73
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,660
a boy whose body turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

76
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,650
After surviving a fierce battle at the Fish-Man Island,

77
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,410
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,--

78
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,280
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

79
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,660
After receiving an emergency signal, they landed on Punk Hazard Island.

80
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,480
It was a strange island divided into two parts; the Burning Lands and the Ice Lands.

81
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,600
I can't let them escape!

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,620
Room!

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,210
What is this?! It's like a thin film...

84
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,260
Shambles!

85
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,460
E-Everybody, calm down!

86
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,720
Let's do a roll call!

87
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
--Chopper!
--Here!

88
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,270
--Franky!
--Yeah!

89
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,680
Sanji-kun?

90
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,030
What?

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,540
Nami-san?

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,510
You're Nami... aren't you?

93
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,570
Uh-huh!

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,790
What is going on here?!

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,050
You stupid pirate, don't push your luck!

96
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,010
You ate the Op-Op Fruit and you're the Modification Man, I believe!

97
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,020
Stay out of his sword's reach!

98
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,400
You guys are in my way! Get out of the circle!

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,530
The circle?!

100
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,790
While you're in the circle he created,

101
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,370
you're like a patient on an operating table!

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
This is his operating room.

103
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,250
He has total control over it and can manipulate anything as he pleases!

104
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,870
He's the Surgeon of Death!

105
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't do it, Tashigi!

106
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,340
Your Haki is not strong enough!

107
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,220
Captain-chan!

108
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,470
"A Collision! Law vs. Vice Admiral Smoker!"

109
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,330
THE LABORATORY - IN FRONT OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE

110
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,910
C-Captain-chan got cut in half!

111
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,500
--Hey, you're alive, aren't you?!
--Tashigi-chan!

112
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,640
How...

113
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,260
How dishonorable! I got sliced but I'm still breathing!

114
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,400
Why don't you just kill me, Trafalgar?!

115
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,910
You talk like a master swordsman.

116
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,330
Let me tell you something, Navy soldier girl.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,830
The weak can't even pick their way to die!

118
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,790
You bastard!

119
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,960
You can't reach me with that sword.

120
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,640
I can chop you more if you liked it.

121
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,670
Damn you! Stop insulting our Captain-chan!

122
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,370
Captain-chan, don't worry!

123
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,200
We'll riddle that fool with bullets!

124
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,250
Bullets?!

125
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,650
How did the bullets get here?!

126
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,670
Where did the bullets that we shot go?!

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,440
Those are the bullets you shot.

128
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,750
I switched them with the snow falling over you.

129
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,180
Is he invincible?!

130
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,760
Get down! He's gonna cut everything again!

131
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,570
No one can stop his sword attack!

132
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,070
That bastard! Captain-chan, run!

133
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,840
Captain-chan!

134
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,300
Smo-yan!

135
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,600
The Surgeon of Death--Trafalgar Law!

136
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
You're just a pirate!

137
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,310
Stop messing with the Navy!

138
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,200
I feel an unpleasant energy.

139
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,040
You have Sea Prism Stone on the tip of your jitte, don't you?

140
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,220
Oh no! The recoil made the sword cut the artwork!

141
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,600
The ship's gonna fall onto us!

142
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,060
Let's run! He doesn't want us to be here anyway!

143
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,820
I don't care if you're a Warlord or not!

144
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,980
Just get out of my way!

145
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,870
Vice Admiral Smoker!

146
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,210
Captain-chan, let's get away!

147
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,880
--But...
--He's no match for us!

148
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,200
White Blow!

149
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,070
Run! Get out of the circle!

150
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,310
Th-They were strong... Too strong...

151
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,540
Straw Hat Luffy and his crew...

152
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,120
Damn! They took Boss Brownbeard with them!

153
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,470
W-We got to help the Boss!

154
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,350
They're cold-blooded pirates!

155
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,420
I don't know what they're gonna do to him!

156
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,700
Boss Brownbeard!

157
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,170
We have to let the Master know!

158
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,060
Follow me, those of you who can stand up!

159
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,110
THE ICE LANDS - LUFFY'S GROUP

160
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,970
I heard a huge noise. Was it Sanji and the others?

161
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,600
Hey, Alliga-taur!

162
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,220
You really don't know what happened to my crew?

163
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,580
Shut up! I won't tell you anything!

164
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,870
Fine. Then run faster! To the building that Brook saw!

165
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,300
We gotta save Nami and the others!

166
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,650
How humiliating to lose to such a squirt!

167
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,390
You robbed my people so cruelly of all they had, you cheap muggers!

168
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,290
Don't try to give us a bad name!

169
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,140
You guys attacked us first!

170
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,940
You're showing no sign of remorse, alligator guy.

171
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,340
Brook, I know you don't feel cold because you don't have flesh...

172
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,830
So why did you steal the coat?!

173
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,130
Because I felt like it.

174
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:10,250
I'm so happy to see you all again so I wanted to share in your feeling cold!

175
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,540
I feel bad that Nami and the others were abducted in those clothes.

176
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,700
I hope they don't get frostbite and lose their limbs.

177
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,880
Geez, Robin! Don't share those gruesome concerns!

178
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,650
Master, what should we do?

179
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,900
Mr. Law and Smoker are in a big battle.

180
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,520
What is he thinking?

181
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,700
I thought the plan was just to make them go away.

182
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,390
But those escaped pirates took the kids in the Biscuit Room with them

183
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,870
and ran into Law and the others at the front.

184
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,050
So the Navy saw the children?!

185
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,870
Yes.

186
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,340
That's what I feared the most.

187
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,580
Now they know something is going on on this island!

188
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,120
Even if we kill Smoker,

189
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,850
the Navy will become aware that something is wrong.

190
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,180
I thought so.

191
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,440
You just got back - what are you doing now, Monet?

192
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,440
It was them.

193
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,450
We should have paid better attention.

194
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,480
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.

195
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
Vegapunk's dragon and

196
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,120
Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit have been defeated.

197
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,620
--What?!
--Unbelievable!

198
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,740
Which means those pirates you kidnapped along with

199
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,710
their ship had other crew members

200
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,720
and they were in the Burning Lands already.

201
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,390
They made it across the lake and they'll be here in a matter of minutes.

202
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,980
They were so strong. Now look.

203
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,440
THE STRAW HATS ARE BACK

204
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm sure it was them.

205
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,070
The Straw Hats...

206
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,590
I'm sure you have heard about them.

207
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,020
They're an unforgivable archenemy not just for the Navy

208
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,250
but for the World Government too.

209
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,080
The World Government, huh?

210
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,310
If they're so notorious, maybe it's good for us!

211
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,370
Whether it's the Straw Hats or Smoker,

212
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,560
we can get rid of all those troublemakers who are learning what's

213
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
going on on this island at once!

214
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,260
But Master, even if they're a group of misfits,

215
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,830
if we kill all the G-5 soldiers,

216
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,230
the Navy would be on the alert, wouldn't they?

217
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,710
Well, we can just suppress things that are going to

218
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,860
happen on the island from now on.

219
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,370
--Call Joker.
--Yes, sir!

220
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,390
A MOUNTAIN BEHIND THE LABORATORY SANJI'S GROUP

221
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,650
We made it out from the backdoor but what should we do now?!

222
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,620
Even with this strange transformation going on,

223
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,490
we have to keep running for now!

224
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,550
What's going on?! It's super confusing!

225
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,200
--Bros!
--W-We're gonna freeze to die!

226
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,750
Deadly cold? I don't give a damn!

227
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,800
The samurai and the brats? I don't give a damn anymore!

228
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,550
What?!

229
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,760
Isn't there a camera somewhere?!

230
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,430
I wanna take a picture before we return to normal!

231
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,140
What're you gonna take a picture of?!

232
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,810
And stop having nosebleeds in my body!

233
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,600
This is more important, Nami! Don't button up my aloha shirt!

234
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,880
Are you all okay?

235
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,420
I know it's cold but hang on a little bit longer!

236
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,900
The Spiral Bro is being kind! It's too creepy!

237
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,450
What happened? Did you get your bodies switched?

238
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,120
Looks like that's what happened.

239
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,080
Hang on, kids!

240
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,410
I'm being treated very differently from before.

241
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,380
I didn't know humans felt this cold!

242
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,010
Bros, stop!

243
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,140
It's cold...

244
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,780
This is it... I-I can't even move...

245
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,900
--Me too!
--I'm freezing too!

246
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,200
Damn! We shouldn't have taken them with us when

247
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,660
we didn't know where to go.

248
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,410
I don't feel cold at all with this body.

249
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,250
Pieces of the ship are falling like leaves off a tree!

250
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,870
Are you okay, Smo-yan?!

251
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,570
Captain-chan, how is your body? Did they stick together?

252
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,190
By the way, your right hand is my left foot!

253
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,110
My hands! Whose feet are these?!

254
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,270
Dammit! We're in big trouble!

255
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,140
We lost our means of communication and the ship!

256
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,780
I thought the Warlords were on our side! That bastard!

257
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,450
Hey hey, Captain-chan, don't try to move! Stay here!

258
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,880
Tashigi, keep this in mind.

259
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,590
Pirates will always be pirates!

260
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,430
Pirates will be pirates!

261
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,780
Why are you here?

262
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,420
No one, not even pirates or Government allies,

263
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,270
is allowed to be here on this island, Law!

264
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,030
That means you people are not allowed, either!

265
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,860
Law, why are you here on Punk Hazard?

266
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,950
I never understood why you joined the Warlords in the first place!

267
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,750
What are you up to?

268
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,680
What we need to do now is to achieve higher status.

269
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,080
Pirates all over the world have started to pay respect

270
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,410
to the Straw Hats because of the incident at Enies Lobby.

271
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,250
Yes.

272
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,630
I'll put all my pride on the line and kick their asses in the New World!

273
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,090
Whether it's the Straw Hats...

274
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,760
...or the Warlord who serves for the World Government - Trafalgar Law,

275
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,020
pirates will be pirates!

276
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,090
I've never trusted you Warlords.

277
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,090
Maybe that's the right thing to do.

278
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,500
Law!

279
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,380
What is this place to you?

280
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,340
Who's behind this?

281
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,130
What are you up to on this island?!

282
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,940
Why don't you answer first?!

283
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,900
What are you all up to?!

284
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,140
There are things that you can't see unless you change your standing, Smoker!

285
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,460
Scalpel!

286
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,990
My heart!

287
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,840
I don't have to tell you anything.

288
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,270
Smoker collapses after his heart is stolen.

289
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,800
With Law looking down coldly before them,

290
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,510
the rage of Tashigi and the G-5 reaches
its peak and they attempt an attack...

291
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,290
When Luffy suddenly appears!

292
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,060
The meeting between the two,
who share a deep bond from the great war,

293
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,730
causes the situation to drastically change!

294
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

295
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,480
"Meeting Again After Two Years!
Luffy and Law!"

296
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,630
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
