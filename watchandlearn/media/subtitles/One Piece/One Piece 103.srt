Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:19,080
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,800
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,660
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,220
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,280
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,590
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,120
Princess Vivi, in an attempt to
stop an orchestrated rebellion,

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,440
decides to talk with the
leader of the rebel army.

29
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,600
The ruined Erumalu behind her,
she now heads straight for Yuba.

"Spiders Café at 8 O'Clock--
The Enemy Leaders Gather"

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,360
Hey, Luffy...

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
What did your brother give you?

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,980
I dunno.

34
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,300
It's just a scrap of paper.

35
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,680
Just a scrap of paper?

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,850
Lemme see that.

37
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,960
It really is just a scrap of paper.
It's not even a note or anything.

38
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,210
A-Are you serious?

39
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,350
I'm not really sure either, but...

40
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,460
Hey! Don't eat that!

41
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,890
Sheesh!

42
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,410
Give me your hat, Luffy!

43
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,420
Huh? This?

44
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,300
If it's that important, I'll sew it to
the underside of your hat ribbon.

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,430
Oh! Great! Sew it good!

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,580
Yes, yes!

47
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,400
Okay! All done!

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,350
Here you go!

49
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,320
Thanks! Now I don't have to worry!

50
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,020
There's nothing written on it.
What point is there to keeping it?

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,460
Ace told me to keep it, so I'm keeping it!

52
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,390
Your confidence isn't based on anything.

53
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,290
So what? It's right a lot!

54
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,180
I don't know about that...

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,540
Someone carry me...

56
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,870
Everyone! Yuba is just over those big rocks!

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,390
Let's make one more push to get there!

58
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,260
Okay!

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,920
Yuba, huh?!

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,140
Yep! Yuba!

61
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,010
Yuba!

62
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,290
Carry me, Zoro...

63
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,230
Don't be a wimp!

64
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,790
Ooh! Carry me too, Zoro!

65
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,780
Rock-paper-scissors, then!

66
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,000
The operation will commence
at high noon two days from now.

67
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,100
Have you finished the arrangements?

68
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,790
Yes. Everything has gone smoothly.

69
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,390
150 Billions are on standby in Nanohana.

70
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,590
I've also called Mr. 2 back.
It appears he failed to capture Mr. 3.

71
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:02,720
The officer agents' gathering is at
8:00 tonight, at the Spiders Café...

72
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,460
Yes. Very good.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,590
It is past 5:00 already.

74
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,980
I assume they'll start
gathering around now...

75
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,980
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

76
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,830
What a long, exhausting trip!
My back's killing me!

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,650
"Miss Merry Christmas"

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,420
Honestly! It's all your fault, Mr. 4!

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,650
Your slowness is backache-inducing!

80
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,330
I'm... sorry...

81
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes! Yes! Yes! How's business, Paula?
The place is empty today!

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,070
Place empty! Plempty! Ple! It's ple!

83
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,620
It's good to see you again.
Welcome, Miss Merry Christmas, Mr. 4.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:11,380
"Paula"

85
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,360
You have the shop all to yourselves today.

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,370
I can make you some orange pekoe
and... apple tea, was it, Mr. 4?

87
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,450
Never mind the hot drinks! I want
something I can drink right away!

88
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,160
Make some right away! Right away!
Right now! Right away!

89
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,100
You seem lively. How is work going?

90
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,490
In my trade, screw up and you die!
Things are going great, obviously!

91
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,200
You imbecile! Imbecile! Imbe! Imb! Im!

92
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,950
You're right. I'm sorry.

93
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,160
Un, deux!

94
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,200
Ora!

95
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,080
Un, deux!

96
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,770
Krah!

97
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,040
What the--? What kind of crazy
songs does this place play now?

98
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,320
Song? No, I have a sonata playing right now.

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,920
There's no singing...

100
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,600
Un, deux!

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,890
Ora!

102
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,850
Huh?

103
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,000
Un, deux!

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,390
Krah!

105
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,240
Look at your fingertip with your nose...

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
Un, deux!

107
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,070
Krah!

108
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,670
Keep with your fingernails!

109
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,530
Un, deux!

110
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,620
Ora!

111
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,710
Before... being born...

112
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,660
Lesson! Lesson!

113
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,150
Love... and mascara!

114
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,050
Mascara with a nosebleed!

115
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,940
I'm self-made!

116
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,880
So... Lesson!

117
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
Lesson!

118
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,150
Lesson!

119
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,490
Lesson!

120
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,340
Oh, come my way!

121
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,590
And... smile!

122
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,970
Oh, the greatest!

123
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,470
The greatest!

124
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,270
Oh, come my way!

125
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,390
Greetings!

126
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,360
How are deux lately?

127
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,060
You must be stupid.

128
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,320
I am not stupid, Paula!

129
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,630
After all, I'm a dancer!

130
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,380
One Octopar, please!

131
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,560
Octopar?

132
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,980
Gimme a break! An Octopus
Parfait! Everyone knows that!

133
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,400
Oh, you guys can leave now!

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,260
Right!

135
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,140
Don't get lazy with your dance practice now!

136
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,230
Right! Un, deux! Un, deux...

137
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,620
Huh? Fatty! Old hag! You're here?

138
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,850
Shut your trap, you! Pipe down,
you're hurting my back!

139
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,900
Oh, right, right, right!

140
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,030
That reminds me, I hear even
Mr. 1's team is being mobilized!

141
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,370
I've never met 'em for whatever
reason, so I just can't wait!

142
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,830
Oh! The night grows ever later!

143
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,280
It's almost the appointed time of 8:00!

144
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,930
Oh, I'm bored!

145
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,850
I'm so bored I spin around!

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,330
I think I'll take a spin!

147
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,270
Quit it! You're an eyesore!

148
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,810
What's your problem, hag?!
You wanna fight or something?!

149
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,260
If that's what you want!

150
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,290
Come, now! Stop it, you two!

151
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,430
H-Hey, now! What happened to you guys?!

152
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,530
Why'd you come bursting back in here?!

153
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,310
N-No... It was him...

154
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,730
Oh. They're acquaintances of yours?

155
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,440
They were acting suspiciously
in the desert, you see.

156
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,200
Don't worry. I doubt they're dead.

157
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,100
You seem to be on rather close terms,

158
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,110
but worthless, cozy relationships
will only result in your downfall.

159
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,580
These men are my subordinates!

160
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,480
Stop, Mr. 2!

161
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,440
Un, Deux, Krah!

162
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,190
Un, Deux, Ora!

163
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,400
Bold Change!

164
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,800
Un! Deux!

165
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,130
What the--?! He slipped through the wall?!

166
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,350
No! He shattered the wall?!

167
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,890
It seems you want to die.

168
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,290
Hold it! That's enough, Mr. 1!

169
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,200
Don't stop me, Miss Doublefinger.
I'm going to kill him.

170
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,210
Stop! Let go of me, Fatty!

171
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,400
Mr. 2! Cool your anger as well!

172
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,640
It's now 8:00. All the agents
that should be here are here.

173
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,240
And a letter with orders has
arrived at the Spiders Café.

174
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,990
We're to head to Rainbase,
the city of dreams.

175
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,860
The man we call boss, the man
whose face we've never seen...

176
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,970
...is waiting for us there.

177
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,650
They should be on their
way here to Rainbase now.

178
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,100
I sent Bunchi to get them. I expect
them to arrive sometime tonight.

179
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,530
To think that you were
actually Miss Doublefinger...

180
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,420
"Miss Doublefinger"

181
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,220
I don't remember ever saying that I wasn't...

182
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,370
Have you found replacements for
the Billions wiped out in Nanohana?

183
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,460
I've finished assigning the replacements.

184
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:40,150
I've dispatched the Lizard Runners
to contact the new Billions.

185
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,220
I see. Everything is progressing smoothly.

186
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,360
Up ahead! I see a light!

187
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,590
Did we make it to Yuba?!
I can't really see with all this sand!

188
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,430
What could that sound be?

189
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,180
The city doesn't look right!

190
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,940
A sandstorm!

191
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,170
The city of Yuba is being
struck by a sandstorm!

192
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,340
This can't be...

193
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,580
This is bad. It's almost no
different from that Erumalu city!

194
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,110
Where's the water?!

195
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,610
Wasn't this supposed to be
an oasis city, Vivi-chan?

196
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,350
The sand has raised the ground!
The oasis has been swallowed up!

197
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,800
Are you travelers?

198
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,570
You must be exhausted from
your trek through the desert...

199
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,690
Sorry. This town is a bit dried up.

200
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,420
But you're free to rest here if you want.

201
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:58,520
There are plenty of inns here.
They are this town's pride, after all.

202
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,480
Umm, we came because we heard
the rebel army was in this city...

203
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,420
What business do you
have with the rebel army?!

204
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,070
Curse you! Don't tell me you're
hoping to join the rebellion?!

205
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,250
If you're looking for those fools,
they left town long ago.

206
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,340
They what?!

207
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,210
No!

208
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,620
A sandstorm hit the town just now,
but it certainly wasn't the first.

209
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,610
The sand has dried up
after three years of drought,

210
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,250
and sandstorms began to
frequent this town ever since.

211
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,290
Little by little, the oasis of
the past was swallowed up,

212
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,380
leaving what you see now.

213
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,710
With the town's flow of supplies gone,

214
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,870
not even the rebel army's protracted
struggle would have worked out.

215
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,650
So the rebel army moved its base to Katorea.

216
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,900
Katorea?!

217
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,880
Where's that, Vivi?! Is Katorea close by?!

218
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,530
It's an oasis next to Nanohana.

219
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,110
Katorea is the town where
I got lost and met Lashes!

220
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,560
"When you saved me..."

221
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,640
Lashes says he was carrying
rebel army goods to Katorea!

222
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,410
Why didn't you say so sooner!

223
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,190
Why, you...!

224
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,410
"Whatever!"

225
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,930
Why did we come all this way, then?!

226
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,050
Vivi?

227
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,340
Did you just say "Vivi"?

228
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,060
Wait, old guy! Vivi isn't the princess!

229
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,300
Don't tell him that, moron!

230
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,740
Vivi-chan? Is it you?

231
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,770
You're alive! Thank goodness!

232
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,940
It's me! Don't you recognize me?

233
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,350
I suppose I can't blame you.
I did lose some weight...

234
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,590
Toto-ojisan?

235
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,060
That's right!

236
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,760
It can't be...

237
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,340
Well, Vivi-chan. This is goodbye for a while.

238
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,920
Come visit sometime,
once the city's taken shape!

239
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,120
Okay, Toto-ojisan!

240
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,410
Yuba will surely make this kingdom lusher...

241
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,660
I'm sure of it...

242
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,650
Toto-ojisan?

243
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:59,260
Vivi-chan. I have faith in His Majesty!

244
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,400
He's not someone who would
ever betray the kingdom.

245
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,320
Don't you agree?!

246
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,970
This rebellion is ridiculous!

247
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,900
Those fools...

248
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,960
So what if it hasn't rained
for a mere three years?

249
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:03,200
I have faith in His Majesty.
Most of the country still does, in fact.

250
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,930
So many times...

251
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,300
So many times I tried to stop them.

252
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,260
But they won't listen to anything I say.

253
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,990
The rebellion won't stop.

254
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,660
Their strength is at its limit, too.

255
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,380
They intend to settle things
once and for all in the next attack.

256
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,920
Their backs are to the wall...

257
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,640
They're prepared to die!

258
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,010
Please, Vivi-chan! Stop those fools!

259
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,500
"Katorea"

260
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,400
Where's our leader?

261
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,240
Inside.

262
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,100
Don't worry, Toto-ojisan.

263
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,710
Vivi-chan...

264
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,620
We will stop the rebellion.

265
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,900
Thank you!

266
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,610
Well, Vivi-chan. This is goodbye for a while.

267
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,580
Come visit sometime,
once the city's taken shape!

268
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,560
Okay, Toto-ojisan!

269
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,910
We're gonna make an awesome city

270
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,600
and make this kingdom even lusher!

271
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,540
Bye, Vivi! Grow up to be a great princess!

272
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,440
Yeah!

273
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,890
Koza!

274
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,930
I've contacted everyone in the other towns.

275
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,450
This is it. The time to strike has come.

276
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,560
Yes. We don't have nearly
enough weapons, however.

277
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,180
But there's no other choice now.

278
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,780
The only ones who can
protect this country...

279
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,730
...are us!

280
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

281
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,990
I continue on to the ends of emotion

282
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:38,630
I scoop up my hands, and the sand
and time that spills from them

283
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:45,670
show me that this is what
I was born to do

284
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:57,820
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

285
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:08,460
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

286
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,670
no one knows about

287
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,580
I want to kick Crocodile's ass!

288
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,150
He really knows how to get
straight to the point sometimes...

289
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,590
Despite being himself.

290
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,220
Vivi! You want it so nobody dies in this fight!

291
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
Don't you think that's soft-hearted?

292
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,010
Hold on, Luffy!

293
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,230
At least put all our lives on the line together!

294
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,630
On the next episode of One Piece!

295
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,100
"Luffy vs. Vivi! The Tearful Vow
to Put Friends on the Line"

296
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
