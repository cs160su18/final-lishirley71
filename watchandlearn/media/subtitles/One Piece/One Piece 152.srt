2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,940
Give back old diamond-head's gold!

20
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,450
Gold?

21
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,930
You mean old man Cricket's stuff?

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,790
So long, Straw Hat!

23
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,060
What's wrong?! Hey, Straw Hat!
Where're you going?!

24
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,690
Where?

25
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,860
The sky!

26
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,250
"Take to the Sky!
Ride the Knock-Up Stream"

27
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,720
Where the heck is he?! It's already morning!

28
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,560
It's 46 minutes over the agreed time!
We're going to miss the current!

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,690
It'll take him longer to come back,
because of all that heavy gold!

30
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,910
I just know he didn't consider that!

31
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,190
No, I don't think he ever
considered the time at all.

32
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,690
Yeah, that's 100% certain.

33
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,450
Do you suppose he was beaten in town?

34
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,570
By that Bellamy guy?!

35
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,450
If he did, he'll have hell to pay
even if he makes it back in time!

36
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,910
I wouldn't put it past you...

37
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,670
Hey!

38
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,470
It's him! Thank goodness! He's back!

39
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,300
I did it!

40
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,720
Luffy! Hurry! We're behind schedule!

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,270
Check it out!

42
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,270
A Hercules! It took me forever to find one!

43
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,060
--You were looking...
--...for a beetle?!

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,980
Whoa! Awesome!

45
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,830
It's the Going Merry Flying Model!

46
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,710
It looks like it can fly!

47
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,190
Doesn't it?! They did it for us!

48
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,490
--Look at 'em go.
--Seeing that makes me feel uneasy...

49
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,590
I agree.

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,890
Even a pigeon would've
been better than a chicken...

51
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,730
That's not the main issue here!
You're an idiot!

52
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,400
Alright! Let's set sail! Ready, men?!

53
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,690
Aye aye, sir!

54
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,990
Get on board already! There's no time!

55
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,000
Or are you plannin' to waste your
chance to go into the sky, you fool?

56
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,380
Right! Thanks for the ship!

57
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,050
It's them you should thank.

58
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,730
Yeah! Thanks, you guys!

59
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,190
You can have my Hercules!

60
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,670
--Seriously?!
--For real?! We can?!

61
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,070
You're a nice guy!

62
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,380
Anyways, let's hurry!
Get on board, before we're too late!

63
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,160
We'll lead the way, so follow us!

64
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,020
--Luffy! Hurry!
--Yeah!

65
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,090
This "city of gold" is just a
product of Noland's imagination!

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,020
You need to realize that
dreams never come true!

67
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,360
Saruyama Alliance!

68
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,320
Don't screw up, now!

69
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,580
No matter what happens,
give everything you got for them!

70
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,660
Yeah!

71
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,690
Alright! Let's go!

72
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,290
It's time to set sail, guys!

73
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,090
--All right!
--Aye, Nami-san!

74
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,730
Kid! This is where we part ways!

75
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,770
Yeah!

76
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,200
There's one thing that's a definite fact.

77
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:17,740
No one in history's ever disproved
the city of gold or the sky island.

78
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,700
Right!

79
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,870
People might laugh and call it
foolish logic, but it's enough for me.

80
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,490
That's what romanticism is all about!

81
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,830
Romanticism...

82
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,550
That's right!

83
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,630
Thanks for the gold...

84
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,360
Don't be fallin' from the sky now, y'hear?!

85
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,690
See ya, old guy!

86
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,280
Thanks for everything, Cricket-san!

87
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,730
I'm sure the city of gold is real, old-timer!

88
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,040
Old guy! Don't overdo things!

89
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,500
Mind your own business!

90
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,220
It's morning already!

91
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,010
Well? See anything?

92
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,410
Can't even see the outline
of the opposite shore yet!

93
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,480
Are they really going to a sky island?

94
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,830
Yeah, that's what they said.

95
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,320
It'll be tough to follow 'em,
so let's take care of 'em before that.

96
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,740
Straw Hat Luffy... A 100 million-Berry bounty...

97
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,300
All right! It's currently 7:00 am!

98
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,830
We should arrive at the destination
area at around 11:00 am!

99
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,330
Like the old-timer said, the spot
the Knock-Up Stream shoots up from

100
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:54,300
changes each time, so we need
to arrive beforehand and find it!

101
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,090
Watch! Watch!

102
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,790
We're a little behind schedule, so...

103
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,600
Hey! Are you listening to my explanation?!

104
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,380
See! It faced forward!

105
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,660
There sure are some weird birds out there!

106
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,940
It's true! It can only face south!
This guy's like a compass! So neat!

107
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,450
What'd he say?

108
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,450
He said he's going to face a
different direction to mess us up.

109
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,370
Go ahead and try!

110
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Oh! He faced north!

111
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,180
He doesn't feel right unless he's facing south!

112
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,310
Hey, you guys! Don't get the big boss mad!

113
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,780
It's all right! Their casualness
is getting me worked up!

114
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,780
Huh? What's wrong?

115
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,920
There's no point in being anxious!

116
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,470
Let's have fun!

117
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,750
And who put us behind schedule?

118
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,340
He's right! There's no point in
being tense for hours on end!

119
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,340
I see! Alright, men!
Full speed ahead... while relaxing!

120
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,630
What nice weather!

121
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,270
Are we gonna be okay?!

122
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,020
Huh?! What's that?!

123
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,980
The sky... is dark!

124
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,290
--Bad news, Boss!
--What's wrong?!

125
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,700
Night's coming from the southwest!
Cumuloregalis clouds!

126
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,180
Seriously?! What time is it?!

127
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,240
10:00! It's way earlier than we expected!

128
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
This is bad... Shojo! Can we make it?

129
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,710
Utan Divers! Into the sea
immediately! Look for currents!

130
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,550
Those are cumuloregalis clouds?!

131
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,890
What, now?!

132
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,980
They appeared sooner than expected!

133
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,140
But we don't even know
where the current is located!

134
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,200
Reflected sound detected!
Large current at 12:00!

135
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,170
Large creature detected at 9:00!
Appears to be a Sea King!

136
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,200
Waves going against the
current detected at 10:00!

137
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,210
I believe it's a giant whirlpool!

138
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,670
That's it! Head the ship in the 10:00 direction!

139
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,420
It's a sign of the explosion!
Catch the whirlpool! Don't draw back!

140
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,390
What the...?!

141
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,640
--The waves suddenly got higher!
--We're gonna sink!

142
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,630
It's a pre-explosion earthquake! Get ready!

143
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,060
E-Explosion?!

144
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,520
Navigator!

145
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,730
What does the Log Pose say?

146
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,320
It's pointing right at those clouds!

147
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,030
The sky island is up there?!

148
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,310
The wind's direction is perfect, too!

149
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,000
The clouds are heading straight
for the center of the whirlpool!

150
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,460
Hey, what's this "whirlpool"? I don't see one...

151
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,250
Looks like we hit the
jackpot this time, brother!

152
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,710
Yeah! And it looks like it'll be
a nice-sized explosion, too!

153
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,530
--We can make it?!
--Yep!

154
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,340
Huh?

155
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,640
We'll take you to the inner
edge of the whirlpool!

156
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,100
What do we do after that?!

157
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,440
Get on the flow! If you can get to
the center, things should work out!

158
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,890
The center of this huge whirlpool?!

159
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,700
I've never met any fools like you before.

160
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,010
I wanna go to the sky island, old guy!

161
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,810
The gold... It's been stolen!

162
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,180
I'll be back by morning.

163
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,990
See ya, old guy!

164
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,280
Prattling on about dreams...

165
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,820
W-We're being sucked in!

166
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,870
Nobody said anything about being sucked in!

167
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,330
It's all right! I'll protect you and Robin-chan!

168
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
I've never seen such a large whirlpool before...

169
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,300
This is bad! Let's turn back! Let me go back!

170
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,630
Just accept it, Usopp! It's too late!
Someone else is already excited!

171
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,390
Let's go! Sky island!

172
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,170
Alright, you guys! The rest is all up to you now!

173
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,840
Right! Thanks for the lift!

174
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,920
Hold on!

175
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,650
Gimme a break, will you?! I'm scared here!

176
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,540
Let me go back, you jerk!

177
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,440
This thing's gonna kill us instantly!

178
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,270
Nobody said anything about a
giant whirlpool! This is a scam!

179
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,320
It's night!

180
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,780
We're being sucked into the whirlpool!

181
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,320
Let's go back, Luffy! We can still make it!

182
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,120
Isn't it obvious?! Just this
whirlpool is enough to kill us!

183
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,110
The sky island's just a dream within a dream!

184
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,410
A dream within a dream? Yeah, huh?

185
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,750
Yes, Luffy! I don't think we can do this, either!

186
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,160
An island in a dream within a dream!

187
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,010
I'll regret it for life if I pass
up such a big adventure!

188
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,640
H-He's enjoying this...

189
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,520
Hey! While you guys are
pointlessly trying to resist...

190
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
Yeah? What?

191
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,900
We're being sucked inside it!

192
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,630
Hurry, Nami-san! Come into my arms!

193
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,480
We're falling!

194
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,150
What?! It disappeared?! How come?!

195
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,200
What happened?!

196
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,090
T-That whirlpool was huge, too!
What's going on?!

197
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,600
No! It's already started!

198
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,690
Eh?

199
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,060
The whirlpool only
disappeared from the surface!

200
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,560
Y-You don't mean...

201
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,180
Hold it!

202
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,920
Hey, Zoro!

203
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,570
Look!

204
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,880
I caught up to ya, Straw Hat Luffy!

205
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,460
That's that guy from Mock Town...!

206
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,550
Who?!

207
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,510
I'm here to collect on your 100
million bounty! Prepare yourself!

208
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,550
Hey, who're they? Friends?

209
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,230
Dunno.

210
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,030
Why's it dark out here?

211
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,160
My bounty? What do you mean, 100 million?

212
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,530
So you don't know!

213
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,420
There's a 100 million-Berry
bounty on your head!

214
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,210
And Pirate Hunter Zoro!
You're worth 60 million!

215
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,310
It's true! He has new wanted posters!

216
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,400
Zoro! You have a bounty now!

217
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,600
What?! Hold on! What about me?!
There's one for me, too, right?!

218
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,580
--Nope.
--Look closer!

219
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,100
Nope.

220
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,230
I see! Your bounties went way up
after the Alabasta incident!

221
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,940
But 100 million...!

222
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,720
100 million! Hear that?! I'm worth 100 million!

223
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,040
60 million, huh? How disappointing!

224
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,950
Don't be happy, you!

225
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,460
Hey, you guys! Don't get distracted!

226
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,420
Here it comes! The Knock-Up Stream!

227
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,060
Get ready!

228
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,720
What the...?

229
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,260
Everyone! Hold on tight
to the ship or get inside!

230
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,270
The ship... it's going up!

231
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,640
Oh, no! We're going to capsize!

232
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,110
Withstand it!

233
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,860
Don't get thrown over!

234
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,270
Go! Sky island!

235
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,170
What the heck's going on?!

236
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,940
The ship's going straight up a pillar of water!

237
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,670
This is neat!

238
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,630
How is this happening?!

239
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,590
Wind?!

240
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:22,550
Alright! Now we can go into the sky! Go, Merry!

241
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,020
Hold on! I don't think it's gonna be that easy!

242
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,260
W-What's wrong?!

243
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,480
Huh? Did we forget something?

244
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,710
The hull's starting to float!

245
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,440
Eh?!

246
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,780
If this keeps up, we're gonna
get sent flying to our doom!

247
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,530
But what do you want us to do?!
We can barely even hold on!

248
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,530
What's that?!

249
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,600
A Sea King!

250
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,770
It's the one that got sucked in earlier!

251
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,750
See! It's only a matter of time
until that happens to us!

252
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:03,290
Hey, now! We're riding up
a powerful explosion!

253
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,720
What can we possibly do?!

254
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,680
I guess it is just a natural disaster!

255
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,980
Lots of stuff is falling!

256
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,710
Victims of the Knock-Up Stream!

257
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,740
We're goners, too! We're gonna fall
and slam into the ocean and die!

258
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,070
--Spread the sails! Right away!
--Eh?

259
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,200
This is the sea! Not just a pillar
of water! It's a rising current!

260
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,440
And the wind blowing from
below is a rising air current

261
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,750
produced by the geothermal
heat and steam explosion!

262
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,050
If we're dealing with wind
and sea, I can navigate it!

263
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,510
Who's this ship's navigator?!

264
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,470
You are, Nami-san!

265
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,600
Alright, men! Do what Nami-san says!

266
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,440
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

267
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,930
Right!

268
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,360
Catch the starboard wind
and pull the helm to point!

269
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,930
Align the ship with the current!

270
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,170
and set out in search
of something to find

271
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,640
Yes, sir!

272
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,610
Oh, no! The ship is about to leave the water!

273
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,610
ONE PIECE!

274
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,070
We're gonna fall! We're gonna fall,
Nami! Do something, Nami!

275
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,080
No, we can make it!

276
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,010
Compasses only cause delays

277
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,410
We're flying!

278
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,750
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

279
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,290
Awesome! The ship is flying!

280
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,710
Is this for real?!

281
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:27,160
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

282
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,010
--We did it!
--Wow!

283
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,420
Nami-san! You're wonderful!

284
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,930
And I love you!

285
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,690
When it comes to personal storms,

286
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,810
Go! To the ends of our unseen dream!

287
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,870
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

288
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,230
Go!

289
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,550
and pretend it isn't there!

290
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,650
With this wind and current,
we can go as high we want!

291
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:48,050
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

292
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,360
Hey! Nami! Are we almost at the sky island?!

293
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:53,760
and set out in search
of something to find

294
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,330
If it exists, it's on the
other side of those clouds!

295
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,620
Above the clouds, huh?!

296
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,000
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

297
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,580
What could be up there?!

298
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,860
Let's plunge through
the cumuloregalis clouds!

299
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,890
We are, We are on the cruise!

300
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,730
We are!

301
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:17,560
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

302
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:27,700
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

303
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,500
There are days where I almost lose to myself

304
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:51,460
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

305
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,040
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

306
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:08,110
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

307
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:17,280
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

308
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,640
This unique moment...

309
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,260
Hey, guys! Look outside the ship!

310
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,260
--What is this place?!
--It's pure white!

311
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,050
Basically, this is an ocean in the sky?!

312
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,220
Ahhh! Something's here!

313
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,930
This is a weird creature...

314
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,240
--Is it a fish?
--Ahh! Something's here!

315
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Now what?!

316
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,110
It's a person! Someone's coming!

317
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

318
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
"Sail the White Sea! The Sky Knight
