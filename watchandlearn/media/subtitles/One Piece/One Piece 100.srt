00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,120
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,240
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,450
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,780
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,720
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,780
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,960
To stop the fighting,

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,290
Luffy and company travel
to the green city of Erumalu

29
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,390
and then head for the Yuba oasis,
where the rebel army is.

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,470
"Rebel Warrior Koza!
The Dream Vowed to Vivi!"

31
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,800
Hey, quit it!

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,120
Look at how much
you spilled! You big waster!

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,390
What's the big deal?!
Ace brought a whole bunch with him!

34
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,680
There's a limit to everything!

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,960
You've been guzzling away for a while now!

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,610
He's tryin' to drink, too.

37
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,900
This is so when Nami-san says,
"Oh, I'm so thirsty!"

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,530
I can take it right to her!

39
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,000
Nami-san! Vivi-chan!
Would you like some water?!

40
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,580
Don't be dumb! I'll drink it!

41
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,030
We're fine for now.

42
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,650
Gimme that!

43
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,420
You're gonna spill it! Quit it!

44
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,760
You want some, too?

45
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,220
Thanks. But I'm fine.

46
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,230
Say, Vivi. Could you tell
me about the rebel army?

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,840
Yes, I probably should tell
you about it in advance.

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,720
It was 11 years ago...

49
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,880
Vivi! Grow up to be a great princess!

50
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,130
"Alabasta Kingdom, 11 Years Ago"

51
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Our village... Our village dried up!

52
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,360
Why didn't you help us?!

53
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,140
But the weather is the doing of the gods.

54
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,320
I may be king, but I cannot
control the forces of nature.

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,960
But my dad said the king
could do anything!

56
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,380
I can only do what can be done by man--

57
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,420
Your Majesty! This boy's
father has come to the palace!

58
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,220
My deepest apologizes, Your Majesty!

59
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,180
Forgive my spoiled son!
I take full responsibility!

60
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,190
I'll accept any punishment!
I will do better! Please, I beg of you!

61
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,720
I can't believe what a fool you are!

62
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,110
You fool! You fool! You fool!

63
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,320
Toto, was it?

64
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,370
Yes, Sire!

65
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,700
The kingdom will temporarily
guarantee the livelihoods

66
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,330
of those villagers affected by the drought.

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,790
You may live here, in Alubarna,
and make plans for your future!

68
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,470
Oh, what thoughtfulness!
Thank you! Thank you!

69
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,220
Whatever! As if you'd understand
the feelings of the villagers!

70
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,770
Wait! Koza! Get back here!

71
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,430
Toto.

72
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,560
Yes, Sire!

73
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,530
He's a good boy. He spoke
of the villagers' feelings.

74
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,490
He stormed in here for
the sake of the villagers.

75
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,660
Hmph. Crybaby.

76
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,880
What did you say, runt?!

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,370
Runt?

78
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,470
Cobra-sama.

79
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
What is it, Igaram?

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,470
With all due respect,

81
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,350
the kingdom doesn't have enough
money to support all of them.

82
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,690
You fool!

83
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,980
We can just trim down our own
living expenses or whatever need be!

84
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,780
Understood. As you wish.

85
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,550
It's terrible, Your Majesty! It's Vivi-sama!

86
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,790
I had a fight. I lost.

87
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,120
--Vivi!
--Vivi-sama!

88
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,440
That little punk!
How dare he harm a princess!

89
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,090
--I'll pulverize him!
--Wait! Wait! Igaram!

90
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,740
My deepest apologies!

91
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,760
I'll die to make amends!

92
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,300
Enough, both of you!

93
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,150
Fools! It was a children's quarrel!

94
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,950
Welcome! Come on over!

95
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,700
Come on over! Low prices!

96
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,500
It's yummy! Here you go!

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,830
It's a showdown!

98
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,710
--Come on over!
--Fight! Fight!

99
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,880
Don't go easy on her
'cause she's a princess!

100
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,590
Teach that sassy princess a lesson!

101
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,280
You can do it, Vivi-chan!

102
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,470
Hey, you! Koza's our leader, you know!

103
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,890
If I win, I get to be your leader!

104
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,190
Like I'd ever lose to you, pipsqueak!

105
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,400
I've always been our leader in the village!

106
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,600
Here goes!

107
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,210
Listen, guys!

108
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,640
As of today, Vivi is the
vice-leader of our Sand-Sand Clan!

109
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,180
Anyone got a problem with that?!

110
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,540
No!

111
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,370
Look, Igaram.

112
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,490
Vivi has made friends.

113
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,110
Yes.

114
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,720
That is the most important thing to have

115
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,870
if she's to carry Alabasta
on her shoulders someday.

116
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,460
Toto-ojisan! Ma'am! Good morning!

117
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,500
Where's Leader?

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,460
Oh, good morning! If you're
looking for Koza, he already left!

119
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,790
I assume he's at the usual spot.

120
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,300
See you later!

121
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,760
Oh, Vivi-chan!
What will you do about lunch?

122
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,970
I'll eat with you! Thanks!

123
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,480
What a strange country this is!

124
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,970
The princess of a kingdom,
mingling with commoners like us!

125
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,940
It's proof of peace!

126
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,280
Igaram-san. Will you join us for lunch?

127
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,000
No, no, that's quite all right!
I brought rice balls!

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,410
Well, I must be going!

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,790
Your Majesty! What are you doing here?!

130
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,380
Urgh! Sire!

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,340
You're following me again?!

132
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,350
B-But I'm worried about Vivi-chan...

133
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,180
Go home! You'll only cause me more work!

134
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,430
What?!

135
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,880
Don't give me, "What?!"

136
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,230
--Sounds like it was a nice country.
--Yes.

137
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,580
--Gimme that water!
--You wish!

138
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,690
But a lot happened...

139
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,500
Heya, girly!

140
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,190
Headed out? Want us to come with ya?

141
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,450
Attack, Sand-Sand Clan!

142
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,070
What's with these guys?!
They still haven't kicked the bucket?!

143
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,900
Leader! Everyone!

144
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,570
Run, Vivi! These guys are out to get you!

145
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,990
--Get going, Vivi!
--They're gonna kill you!

146
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,910
But... Leader!

147
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,080
We ain't gonna kill ya!

148
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,130
We want ransom money,
so we're just gonna kidnap ya!

149
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Damn you!

150
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,630
Now come here, Princess Vivi!

151
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,350
I won't let you have her!

152
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,800
Protect her to the death, Sand-Sand Clan!

153
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,700
What is that?!

154
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,520
What is this thing?!

155
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,820
Huh? What is this?

156
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,840
Poke, poke, pokey, poke.

157
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,020
It's huge!

158
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,980
Wow!

159
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,910
Say. Tell me more about what happened!

160
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,870
Yes. Our leader, Koza,
was a very strong-hearted boy...

161
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,120
But I was worried for that heart once...

162
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,750
I won't let you have her!

163
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,840
Protect her to the death, Sand-Sand Clan!

164
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,360
What pathetic excuses for bodyguards!

165
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,030
There are more of 'em?!

166
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,850
Oww! Oww!

167
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,860
Damn! She got away!

168
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,700
The ruins are that way! Catch her!

169
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,980
Don't let 'em go!

170
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,790
Move!

171
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,460
What on earth?!

172
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,390
Hey! What happened to you?!
What happened here?!

173
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,770
Some bad guys came to get Vivi...

174
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,860
What?!

175
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,160
Grownups, with blades...

176
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,950
They just went into the ruins!

177
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,820
Koza went after them, too!

178
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,530
What?!

179
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,230
Oh, Princess! Where are you, Princess?

180
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,520
Where the hell are you hiding?

181
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,160
Find her! Find her!
Don't let her get away!

182
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,850
Princess Vivi! Come on out!

183
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,100
Oh, there ya are!

184
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,610
Please, just let us catch
you like a good little girl!

185
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,420
Not so fast!

186
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,540
Leader!

187
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,810
You alright, Vivi?!

188
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,270
Oww...

189
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,050
Don't underestimate the
Sand-Sand Clan, villain!

190
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,880
Leave this city at once!

191
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,570
Listen, boy. Shut up and
give the princess here.

192
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,070
It's not smart to make grownups mad.

193
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,640
A blade! Let's run away, Leader!

194
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,770
--That doesn't scare me!
--Huh?!

195
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,780
Protect her to the death, Sand-Sand Clan!

196
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,740
Leader! Don't do this!

197
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,200
You wanna fight, huh?

198
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,240
Leader!

199
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,200
Bastard knocked our boss out!

200
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,460
What the hell?! Let's give him a thrashing!

201
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,780
Alright! Come here!

202
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,380
Hey, you!

203
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,340
You dimwits!

204
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,800
Daddy! Igaram!

205
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,810
Vivi-sama! Are you all right?!

206
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,770
Curse you! Thought you could
kidnap my daughter, did you?!

207
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,470
You lousy vagabonds!
Take this! And this! And this!

208
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,380
These appear to be their friends.

209
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,190
Chaka! Pell! What are you doing here?

210
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,090
Why? That's what we'd like to ask you.

211
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,330
What is the king doing in a place
like this, away from the palace?

212
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,820
You should refrain from
acting so recklessly.

213
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,170
Igaram! Koza's been hurt!

214
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,450
Yes! Let's get him to a doctor immediately!

215
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,880
The Sand-Sand Clan members
atop the hill, as well!

216
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,800
Chaka! Pell! Make arrangements at once!

217
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,570
Yes, sir!

218
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,740
What brave children!

219
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,100
What's wrong, Vivi? Why so glum?

220
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,500
I was so scared...

221
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,570
Yeah, I was scared too.

222
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,530
They had blades with them and all...

223
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,420
No!

224
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,600
You told them to protect
me to the death, Leader...

225
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,580
Protect her to the death, Sand-Sand Clan!

226
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,620
Don't talk about dying, Leader...

227
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,220
Oh, more than anything,
she was afraid of losing her friends...

228
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,450
Vivi is still little, but a princess, Koza.

229
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,100
Your deed today was an immense one.

230
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,830
You have my gratitude. Thank you.

231
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,250
Vivi's a friend. It was only natural.

232
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,220
I see.

233
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,440
I can tell the next generation of
Alabasta will be in good hands.

234
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,420
Do you like this country?

235
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,860
Yeah! I was born here!

236
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,050
I'm the same way!

237
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,110
I'm...

238
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm also a bit concerned.

239
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,160
How so?

240
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,750
Standing above others requires
difficult decisions in no small measure.

241
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,200
Vivi-sama is too kindhearted for that.

242
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,290
Igaram.

243
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:03,960
Yes, Sire?

244
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,340
This is fine. Alabasta is
fine just as it is now.

245
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,860
Allow me to accompany you,
for as long as I live!

246
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,220
Yuba?

247
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,680
Yeah! Your dad talked
to my dad about it!

248
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,560
Old man Toto?

249
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,520
He asked if he'd want to start a
town at the empty oasis of Yuba!

250
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,600
That area's like the
crossroads of Alabasta,

251
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,920
where all kinds of travelers
and merchants pass through!

252
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,620
Just wait until a town is built there!

253
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,970
So many citizens will be happy!

254
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,420
Awesome, huh?!

255
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,750
And my dad was asked
to be its representative!

256
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,500
Are you going too, Leader?

257
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,630
Of course!

258
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,380
My dad says to stay here...

259
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,800
...and starting a city is no easy matter...

260
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,960
...but I'm gonna do it!

261
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,350
I'm gonna build a new city
with my own two hands!

262
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,710
This country needs the city of Yuba!

263
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,930
We're counting on you, Toto.

264
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,410
Yes, Your Majesty!
We will build a wonderful city!

265
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,880
Well, Vivi-chan.
This is goodbye for a while.

266
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,590
Come visit sometime,
once the city's taken shape!

267
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,920
Okay, Toto-ojisan!

268
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,190
We're gonna make an awesome city

269
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,680
and make this kingdom even lusher!

270
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,640
Time to go!

271
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,180
Bye, Vivi! Grow up to be a great princess!

272
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,220
Yeah!

273
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,270
Koza! Don't act so high and mighty!

274
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,080
Oww!

275
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,890
Koza is right.

276
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,050
Yuba will surely make
this country lusher.

277
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
I see. This Koza friend of
yours was a really nice boy.

278
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,460
But that has something
to do with the rebel army?

279
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,420
Yes. It does.

280
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,640
We're going to the city of Yuba,
where the rebel army is stationed.

281
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,210
And the name of the rebel army's leader...

282
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,010
...is Koza.

283
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,510
You don't mean--!

284
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,230
The boy I just told you about.

285
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,190
Nami-san! Would you
like some too, Nami-san?!

286
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,830
This desert shrimp is yummy!

287
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,160
It's not a shrimp! It's a scorpion!

288
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,390
C-Can't eat any more!

289
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,640
Knock that off, you guys!

290
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,100
Let's go, Lashes!

291
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,050
What's she so mad about?

292
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,650
Beats me.

293
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,940
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

294
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,030
I continue on to the ends of emotion

295
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:32,110
I scoop up my hands,

296
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:38,620
and the sand and time
that spills from them

297
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:45,630
show me that this is
what I was born to do

298
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:56,670
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

299
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:08,490
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

300
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,240
no one knows about

301
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,740
Ace hardly seems like
a wanted criminal, huh?

302
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,720
Yet, pirates all over the world
fear the name "Fire Fist Ace."

303
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,680
What kind of pirate is this
Blackbeard he's chasing?

304
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,200
I hear there's someone who beat Blackbeard.

305
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,230
--Yeah, a bounty hunter named Scorpion.
--There's someone that awesome?!

306
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,670
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,690
"Showdown in a Heat Haze!
Ace vs. the Gallant Scorpion"

308
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,380
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
