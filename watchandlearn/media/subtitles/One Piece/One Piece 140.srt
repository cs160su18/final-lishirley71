2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,230
You're the insolent folks

20
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,850
who didn't pay their taxes
at the harbor, aren't you?

21
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,830
Sanji!

22
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,530
Geez, what are you doing?!

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,790
That's the Rainbow Mist!

24
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,880
Professor, where are we?

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,840
Ape's Concert.

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Ape's Concert? It couldn't be.

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,850
W-What's that?!

28
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,150
A ship graveyard, where once
you enter, you can never get out.

29
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,990
"Residents of the Land of Eternity!
The Pumpkin Pirates!"

30
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,980
Hey, look! There's nothing but
sunken ships, as far as you can see!

31
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,280
L-Let's give this up. It feels like a
ghost captain might appear at any time.

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,680
Really? Ghost captain!

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,470
Don't call to them!

34
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,560
Beyond the Rainbow Mist
is the world of the eternal.

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,650
The final paradise remaining on earth.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,060
It's filled with treasures of gold and silver,

37
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,060
where people live forever
without aging or going hungry.

38
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,640
That's what's written in this book.

39
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,120
I told you, that's nothing more than a legend.

40
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,830
Professor, you knew that this
place was a ship graveyard?

41
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,290
Yeah. 50 years ago, I got a
short glimpse of this place.

42
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,000
If you knew it, then why come?

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,380
I told you that, too.
I've been carrying on my research

44
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,010
in order to rescue my friends that
were swallowed up in this mist.

45
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,260
I even became Wetton's dog,

46
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,060
and put up with the
finger-pointing, to that end.

47
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,190
Hey!

48
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,350
Look at this!

49
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,370
What's this?

50
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,830
Isn't it awesome? There's lots,
lots more inside the ship!

51
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,090
I'm gonna go explore some more!

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,880
Whether this is a paradise or not,

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,520
the "being filled with treasure"
thing doesn't appear to be

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,860
altogether untrue, huh, Professor?

55
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,900
Those who would disturb
the rest of the dead...

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,320
W-What's that?!

57
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,770
Leave the cargo, and depart at once,

58
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,960
or else, the curse of the dead shall befall you!

59
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,420
I-I'm s-scared...!

60
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,880
Who's there?

61
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,130
There they are!

62
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Now, hand over the cargo, nice and easy...

63
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,550
Or else...

64
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,980
That was close! You rotten...

65
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,320
Ghost captain...!

66
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,080
There's nothing inside!

67
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,040
They're... ghosts... all... right...!

68
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,120
But that arrow came from over there.

69
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,840
What?

70
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,140
Luffy! Over there!

71
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,100
There's someone over there!
Hey, listen to me, Luffy!

72
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,800
Luffy, I say!

73
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,640
Oh, a bow.

74
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,610
Luffy! Watch out!

75
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,530
Luffy...!

76
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,120
Why, you...!

77
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,710
Special attack: Fire Star!!

78
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,470
What's this?

79
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,520
--Akibi!
--Wait, Rongo!

80
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,650
--Akibi!
--Take it easy, Rongo!

81
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,270
Oh, you're just kids, aren't you?

82
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,620
Rongo!

83
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,320
Akibi!

84
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,490
You idiot, stay away! Run!

85
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,960
Gum-Gum...

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,020
...I'm Home!!

87
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,620
Yo, thank you for that earlier.

88
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,920
You're welcome.

89
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,760
Rongo!

90
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,400
That's enough!

91
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,690
We are the Pumpkin Pirates,
and Ape's Concert is our territory!

92
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,820
Release my friends, and turn over
the cargo, if you want to live!

93
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,360
A bomb?

94
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,820
Rapa Nui!

95
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,780
Could it be...?

96
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,920
Hey, now, if you use that, you'll blow us all up!

97
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,500
We're all in the same boat!
We live, and die, together!

98
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,510
--Let's go.
--I'm sorry, Rapa Nui. Rongo!

99
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,970
Rapa Nui...? Is that you, Rapa Nui...?

100
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,650
And... Isoka, and Rongo... It's you, all right...

101
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,900
Don't you know me? It's me, Henzo!

102
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,200
We always used to play together,
on Cape Luluka!

103
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,910
Henzo?!

104
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,810
You know them?

105
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,370
Henzo? You don't mean that Henzo!

106
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,910
You idiot, there's no way...

107
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,260
Stay back! I-I'll blow us up! Stay back, I said!

108
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,050
S-Stop!

109
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,180
Kaboom Mark III. I invented it, after all.

110
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,300
It's just a gizmo used for bluffing.

111
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,910
Damn, it's a smokescreen!

112
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,690
What's all the racket...?

113
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,620
You're just now waking up?!

114
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,080
Huh? For that matter, who's the old guy?

115
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,840
Well, it would take a bit of
time to explain it to you.

116
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,520
Hey, they're gone from over here, too.
Who was that just now?

117
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,730
Huh, Pops?

118
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,850
Henzo! Hurry on down!

119
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,910
I-I'm too scared!

120
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,810
Don't be afraid over something
like this! We're the Pumpkin Pirates!

121
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,260
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a real pirate.

122
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,010
But Rapa Nui, your father is a marine, right?

123
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,840
Is he going to let you?

124
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,800
My pop is my pop.

125
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,230
I want to have adventures in places
that nobody has seen before!

126
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,190
Places nobody has seen before?

127
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,600
Sure. There are still lots of things in
this world that nobody knows about.

128
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,580
I want to see them, too.

129
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,070
Me, too. I'll be a pirate, too.

130
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,010
But we'll have to fight with
other pirates, too, right?

131
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,590
Someone as weak as I am couldn't do that.

132
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,610
Henzo, you can invent all
sorts of things, can't you?

133
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,090
You'll invent the gear that
we'll need for our adventures.

134
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,050
Hey, yeah!

135
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,620
Okay, I'll be a pirate, too!

136
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,220
You're easy to convince, Henzo!

137
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,190
We were so happy.

138
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,800
Playing as friends, and chatting...

139
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,650
I spent the best days of my life with them.

140
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,350
Every day was so bright,
it doesn't even compare to treasure.

141
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,370
Until that one dreadful event occurred...

142
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,410
Henzo!

143
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,110
Henzo! Are you all right?!

144
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,570
I've perfected the Kaboom Mark III!

145
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,800
You idiot! Don't scare us like that!

146
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,860
You sure do have a lot of false alarms, huh?

147
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,500
Holy crap! The town is on fire!

148
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,870
The town of Luluka is on fire!

149
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,980
--What is this...?
--Our town...

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,780
Dad! Mom!

151
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,100
Rongo!

152
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,830
Burn! Burn!

153
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,650
Leave nothing of value!

154
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,290
Kill everyone that opposes us,
the Wetton Pirates! Got it?!

155
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,470
Show the women and children no mercy!

156
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,920
Pirates!

157
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,230
What's this, there are still some kids
who haven't run away, are there?

158
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,200
Listen, guys, once we get to the harbor,
there will be ships there.

159
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,700
We'll take one of them, it doesn't
matter which one, and get out of here.

160
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,880
But what about Dad, and the others?!

161
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,490
You idiot! Do you wanna get killed?!

162
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,640
Go!

163
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,930
Those brats...

164
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,290
The ships...!

165
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,740
Those guys earlier must have sunk them!

166
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,180
Over there! We'll get on that one!

167
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,440
Eh? That one?

168
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,250
There aren't any others, right? Hurry!

169
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
What are you doing to my ship?!

170
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,930
Here he comes!

171
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,100
Damn it!

172
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,730
Ker-splash!

173
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,910
You all are ready to answer for this, right?

174
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,300
Hurry, up there!

175
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,840
You think someone like you
can handle this axe?

176
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,070
Don't get too cocky, kid.

177
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,780
I'm not a kid! I'm Rapa Nui,
the leader of the Pumpkin Pirates!

178
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,170
--Rapa Nui!
--It's all right! He's just one man!

179
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,500
Let's all join our forces together,
and defeat him!

180
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,000
Huh? Captain, are we setting sail already?

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,090
There's another one!

182
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,050
Huh? Who are you guys?

183
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,860
What is that?!

184
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,100
The Rainbow Mist!

185
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,700
Hey, hurry and turn the helm!

186
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,660
If we get swallowed up inside there,
we won't be able to get back!

187
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,140
The helm is busted!

188
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,430
Why, you... You'll pay for this!

189
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,210
Akibi!

190
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,250
Don't think you're getting
out of here alive anymore.

191
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,780
Akibi!

192
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,980
Your shoulder's dislocated.

193
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,260
Rapa Nui!

194
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,840
You'll pay for that!

195
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,460
Henzo!

196
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,020
Henzo!

197
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,820
Go back! Turn the ship back!

198
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,170
We can't! The helm is busted!

199
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,930
The Rainbow Mist... The Rainbow Mist...!

200
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,470
Rapa Nui!

201
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,770
Go on! Keep going! Don't worry about me!

202
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,230
Henzo!

203
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,810
I promise, I'll come after you later!

204
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:15,040
I am a member of the
Pumpkin Pirates, after all!

205
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,060
Henzo...

206
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,040
Ever since...

207
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,350
Ever since, Rapa Nui and
the others have never returned.

208
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,400
To think that they actually
became pirates in a place like this...

209
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,100
Yeah, but that happened 50 years ago, right?

210
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,990
They were still just little kids.

211
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,820
The passage of time within the
Rainbow Mist appears to be different.

212
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,180
One day in here might be equivalent to a week,

213
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,510
or even a year, in the outside world.

214
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,180
W-What?!

215
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,760
If that's true, we have to
find a way out of here fast,

216
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,920
or there'll be no undoing the damage.

217
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,600
Why not?

218
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,560
You are so dense!
The same thing that happened

219
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,080
between those kids earlier and the
old man could happen to us, too!

220
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,150
While we're in here, puttering around,

221
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,830
Nami and the others we left behind
will become old men and women!

222
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,880
What?!

223
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,110
Hey, Pops, let's go back, quick!

224
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,960
Like he said, we don't know how to get back!

225
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,210
--What?! Is that right?!
--So, there's no way back?

226
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,160
--What have you been listening to, Luffy?!
--No... There must be a way

227
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,690
--They must have said it... three times now!
--to get out of Ape's Concert.

228
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,060
Oh, that many times?

229
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,240
Geez, these guys are persistent.

230
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,030
That weapon is a real problem.

231
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,190
You shut your traps! I'll finish you off!

232
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,800
--Lake-sama!
--Are you all right, Lake-sama?

233
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,900
Are you the ones who chucked that?!

234
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,130
No, not us.

235
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,120
For that matter, wasn't he watching?

236
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
He is wearing that thing, and all.

237
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,940
I asked you, was it you?!

238
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,400
What if we say it was?

239
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,500
All right.

240
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,860
You're picking it up?!

241
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,690
I have collected your harbor dues.

242
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,580
I now formally welcome
you as a citizen of Luluka.

243
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,940
Ape's Concert, you say?

244
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,630
Yeah. Some soldiers said
they saw your ship enter

245
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,260
the Rainbow Mist, no doubt about it.

246
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,180
From what the mayor says, it's
piled up with treasure in there.

247
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,270
Treasure?!

248
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,230
They say that Ape's Concert
is a ship graveyard.

249
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,890
The shipwrecks in there have
untouched cargo all over the place.

250
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,330
The mayor is after that treasure,
which is why he has a scientist,

251
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,470
named Henzo, researching a way
to get into Ape's Concert.

252
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,310
Ah, the old man made
this electroshock suit, too.

253
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,270
What do you think? Pretty damn slick, isn't it?

254
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,760
This guy sure likes to talk a lot, huh?

255
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,130
Shouldn't he be content
with just getting the tax?

256
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,390
We can't just stand around here!

257
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,340
We're going in into that mist, too!

258
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,100
Yes, sir, Nami-san!

259
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,970
But once we go in there,
there's no coming out!

260
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,620
What good will getting scared do?
Our treasure is waiting for us!

261
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,430
Eh?!

262
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,720
No one is allowed into Ape's Concert
without my permission.

263
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,780
--Grandpa!
--You bonehead!

264
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,660
Grandpa...?

265
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,490
You've got a poor memory.
Aren't I always telling you?

266
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,900
You are to call me "Mayor."

267
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,540
"Mayor Wetton."

268
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:17,520
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

269
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:27,700
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

270
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,420
There are days where I almost lose to myself

271
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:51,460
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

272
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,000
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

273
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,010
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

274
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:17,280
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

275
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,640
This unique moment...

276
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,080
Can you believe that the old man
and those kids were the same age?

277
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,520
Hey, what are you doing, Luffy?

278
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,460
I was thinking that if we get the
ship going, we can get out of here.

279
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,180
Should we be doing that without Nami?!

280
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,870
She's probably upset
about being left behind.

281
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,220
She might be a wrinkly
old woman by now, huh?

282
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,980
Don't say anything so chilling!

283
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,540
On the next episode of One Piece!

284
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,880
"Thoughts of Home!
The Pirate Graveyard of No Escape!"

285
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
