00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,390
We keep finding the things we

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

53

54

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,900
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,560
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,310
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

73
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,200
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

74
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,790
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

75
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,790
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,
he decided to enter.

76
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,310
Burgess from the Blackbeard Pirates won
the match of Block A.

77
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,030
Now, the battle of Block B has begun.

78
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,320
Meanwhile, Law and the others are...

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,720
Hey, Tra-guy!

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,850
You have to change the handing-over spot now!

81
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,620
I'm not gonna change.

82
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,120
We're already here. Stop making a fuss.

83
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,930
More importantly,

84
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,930
I'm worried about the situation of this country.

85
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,370
Their king quit all of a sudden.

86
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,070
How come they are so calm?

87
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,850
We're in unexpected circumstances already.

88
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,300
That's what worries me!

89
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,810
King...

90
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,450
...Punch!

91
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,080
Barrier!

92
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,690
I'm a barrier human who ate
the Barrier-Barrier Fruit!

93
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,790
Barrier Crash!

94
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,100
The winner of Block B is...

95
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,430
Dammit!

96
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,190
...Bartolomeo!

97
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,400
"The Fighting Fish Strike!
Across the Deadly Iron Bridge!"

98
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,930
I can't believe it!

99
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,070
Now it's clear, the battle of

100
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,030
Block B ended with Bartolomeo as its winner!

101
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,640
That strange guy won after all.

102
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,450
Now...

103
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,670
The giant old pops and Cabbage are gone.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
I better run now!

105
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,300
--Move!
--You're in our way!

106
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,750
Bellamy?

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
You...

108
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,970
Bellamy.

109
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,270
Why did you cheer me on?

110
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,990
That was so embarrassing!

111
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,180
I haven't changed a bit.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,770
You've changed, Bellamy.

113
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,210
No, you have changed.

114
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,580
You now use Haki that's far greater
than anyone can imagine.

115
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,510
That pisses me off!

116
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,220
My pride has been broken to pieces!

117
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,990
Straw Hat!

118
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,630
S... S... S... S...

119
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,890
S...

120
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,460
Straw Hat?!

121
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,280
45 MINUTES BEFORE THE HANDOVER

122
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,950
CAESAR HANDOVER TEAM

123
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,980
Wow... It's a very solid-looking bridge.

124
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,650
We'll be okay if that Fighting Fish thing

125
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,600
attacks us on this, won't we?

126
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,590
I hope so.

127
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,910
It's coming.

128
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,380
--Huh?!
--What's coming?

129
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,290
Hey hey, don't tell me
you're talking about...

130
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,830
Oh? What is that noise?!

131
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,640
Hey, look!

132
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,110
It...

133
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,800
It's here!

134
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,690
It...

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,230
It showed itself!

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,420
I thought a Fighting Fish would be a fish.

137
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,300
It is a fish.

138
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,080
You can't call that a fish!
It's no different from a sea monster!

139
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,840
It's a beast!

140
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,750
It's coming again!

141
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,660
There is more than one!

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,620
There are a bunch of them!

143
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,020
The guy said they reinforced the bridge

144
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,370
with iron to protect it from them!

145
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,590
I-It's going to be alright, isn't it?!

146
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,400
The bridge is a piece of crap!

147
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,540
Can we make it to Green Bit like this?!

148
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,670
We're gonna be okay.

149
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,030
They can take care of them.

150
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,510
You handle it, Warlord!

151
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,500
I can't fight now.

152
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,530
Here it comes!

153
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,490
Special Attack - Green Star...

154
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,500
Another one from the opposite side!

155
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,400
They're gonna crush us!

156
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,300
Mil Fleurs!

157
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,290
Gigantesco Mano!

158
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,370
Spank!

159
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,240
Skull Bombgrass!

160
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,620
You're doing great!

161
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,820
No, we're not!
Can't you see how many there are?!

162
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,320
It's a school!

163
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,630
Let's just run!
It'll take forever to fight them all!

164
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,670
Skull Bombgrass!

165
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,700
Nose-ya, uncuff Caesar!
I want him to fight, too!

166
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,580
What are you saying?!
He's gonna fly away then!

167
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,220
He wouldn't dare make a move like that.

168
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,950
Don't tell me it's...

169
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,590
My heart!

170
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,620
You won't die a peaceful death...

171
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,760
...after pushing around a
great scientist like me!

172
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,730
Gastille!

173
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,340
Oh, that's so powerful!

174
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,510
Only a criminal with a 300 million
berry bounty could do that!

175
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,110
Gastille!

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,910
Run!

177
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,150
Like I said, why aren't you fighting?!

178
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,470
Yeah, don't just make me fight all of them!

179
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,990
It takes so much energy to use my ability.

180
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,250
And I have to be at my best on our way back!

181
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,360
Do you understand?!

182
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,330
I want to keep my strength up
as much as possible!

183
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,910
Because our enemy is Doflamingo!

184
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,570
Law... Is he really going
to fight against Joker?!

185
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,550
Oh no! What should we do?!

186
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,690
The bridge is collapsed.

187
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,020
On top of that, I can't see the other

188
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,650
side clearly because of the fog!

189
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,560
A Fighting Fish is coming towards us!

190
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,530
Damn! I can't let it destroy
anymore of the bridge!

191
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,230
Roo...

192
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,980
It stopped.

193
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,730
--We caught it!
--Alright, let's pull it in!

194
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,370
We had a decisive battle today!

195
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,930
Let's eat Fighting Fish stew
to boost up our energy!

196
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,980
Yeah!

197
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,730
Who's voice is that?

198
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,090
Residents of the island?

199
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,640
I thought it was a deserted island.

200
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,640
Hey! Who is over there on the other side?!

201
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,480
We want to cross the bridge!

202
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,680
Oh no! It's a human!

203
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,480
Hurry up! Run!

204
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,810
What was that all about?

205
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,700
Anyway, let's keep moving!

206
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,200
Guys! Enough already!

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,090
Caesar!

208
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,080
What?

209
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,890
Fly us to the island.

210
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,190
Law, you bastard!
I'll get even with you, I mean it!

211
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,930
Wow, what a view! What a lovely view!

212
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,980
We should have flown ourselves
like this from the beginning.

213
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,060
Oh, you're right!

214
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,480
Cut that crap!

215
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,890
How much gas energy do you think
you need to fly three people?!

216
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,780
I'm an important hostage for you!

217
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,340
THE DESERTED ISLAND NORTH OF DRESSROSA

218
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,630
The drag marks from the fish end there.

219
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,620
Nobody is here yet.

220
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,600
What was that about?

221
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,200
Shipwrecks from Fighting Fish attacks

222
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,840
are filling up the water around here.

223
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,380
What's that?!

224
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,450
What is this place?!

225
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:23,190
GREEN BIT

226
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,440
A very wild forest?!

227
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,570
Now, the battle of Block C!

228
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,230
The battle will commence shortly
after they finish fixing the ring!

229
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,570
All competitors of Block C,
please go to the entrance gate!

230
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,960
Oh, it's about time, huh?

231
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:09,230
I repeat! All competitors of Block C,
please go to the entrance gate!

232
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,890
Alright! I'm ready to go!

233
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,400
Now let me introduce

234
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,840
the competitors who everyone
should keep an eye on!

235
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,360
He is the two-time champion of
the New World Central Fighting Tournament!

236
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,690
"Destruction Cannon" Ideo!

237
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,080
They are savage assassins
who are able to kill pirates

238
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,240
with more than a 100 million bounty!

239
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,610
The Funk Brothers!

240
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,150
He is from the famous
Giants' country - Elbaf!

241
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,800
The most formidable "Pirate Mercenary"!

242
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,870
Hajrudin!

243
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,700
There are a lot more!

244
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,150
Known for his violence

245
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,930
which he uses in order to drive
his target into the corner!

246
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,680
Jean the Bandit!

247
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,050
Who can stop this bull?!

248
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,710
The Colosseum's Grim Reaper!

249
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,280
Brutal Bull!

250
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,880
Today's likely winner!

251
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,690
The gang from the Kano Kingdom!

252
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,040
Sai!

253
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Boo!

254
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:31,740
And the legendary former
pirate - Don Chinjao!

255
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,400
Straw Hat!

256
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,820
There are also a lot more tough contenders!

257
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,410
It's going to be an exciting match!

258
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,730
The battle of Block C will
be a very fierce one!

259
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,670
Get ready for it!

260
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,580
A little while ago...

261
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,720
In the "next town" over in Dressrosa...

262
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,250
What's the matter?

263
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,550
This was a bad idea! Why don't you go back?!

264
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,990
Sanji-san, I must've been out of my mind!

265
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,410
How horrible I was to ask you such a thing!

266
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,330
To ask you to kill that man!

267
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,760
How could I ask you such a thing?!

268
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,870
Even though you're quite a strong man!

269
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,340
I tried to use you.

270
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,710
Please! Just walk away!

271
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,980
Don't get involved with me anymore!

272
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,130
I don't want you to die because of me!

273
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,230
You said the man is in that storage room,
didn't you, Violet-chan?

274
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm going in.

275
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,680
What?

276
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,700
Aren't you gonna ask me why?!

277
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
Ask you why?

278
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,110
I mean, the reason I want you to kill him!

279
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,640
I don't need to hear that.

280
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,280
Seeing your tears is good enough for me.

281
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,530
Sanji-san!

282
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,320
Wait for me!

283
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,250
I'll take care of everything and be back!

284
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,300
I'm your bodyguard!

285
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,730
What the...

286
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,010
Who is it?!

287
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,020
Why don't you have your last cigarette?

288
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,280
I'll give you a few minutes to do that.

289
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,430
Huh? Who the hell are you?

290
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,120
Are you the asshole
who makes Violet-chan cry?

291
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,810
What? So that woman asked you to do this?

292
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,510
Poor Violet-chan...

293
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,760
She shouldn't be fooled by a crumb like him.

294
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,130
What?! Screw you!

295
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,540
Guys!

296
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,890
Kill that son of a bitch!

297
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,130
Go away, small fry.

298
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,600
--What did you say?!
--Kill him!

299
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,950
Oeil!

300
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,000
Flanchet!

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,820
Joue!

302
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,640
Poitrine!

303
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,210
Party Table Kick Course!

304
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,380
I told you.

305
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,310
Go away, small fry.

306
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,690
Violet-chan!

307
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,000
Sanji-san!

308
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,110
Dammit! You bastard!

309
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,470
Get your filthy hands off of her!

310
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,130
Shut up!

311
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,010
If you don't want me to kill her,
you better not move...

312
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,280
Damn!
Where... Where did he go?!

313
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,300
Hey!

314
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,870
I won't forgive a man like you
who makes a woman cry!

315
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,670
Diable Jambe!

316
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,750
Amour Shot!

317
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,690
Nobody can stop...

318
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,340
...our love!

319
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,590
Sanji-san, I was scared!

320
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,830
You're not hurt, are you, Violet-chan?

321
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,940
No! Thank you!

322
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,280
That's good.

323
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,740
Sanji-san,

324
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,150
can I ask you a favor?

325
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,850
What is it?

326
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,620
I would do anything for you, Violet-chan!

327
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,110
Yeah?

328
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,690
Huh?

329
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,280
Then will you...

330
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,490

331
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,430
What? V-Violet-chan?

332
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,360
What are you talking about?

333
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,150
What an idiot.
