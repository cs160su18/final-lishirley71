2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,070
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,960
He and the Whitebeards have invaded to
the plaza to make it to the scaffold!

62
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,330
In the midst of the Navy's onslaught,
with the Whitebeards' assistance,

63
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,540
Luffy ran on the path that Inazuma
created and finally made it to Ace!

64
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm a remnant from the old times!

65
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,390
There is no ship that can
bear me in the new era!

66
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,690
Let's get it over with!

67
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,820
"The Power That Can Burn Even
Fire! Akainu's Ruthless Pursuit!"

68
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,210
--Marineford is in danger!
--Stop Whitebeard!

69
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,840
ABSOLUTE JUSTICE

70
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,840
He's willing to destroy the whole island!

71
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,300
Pops!

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,860
I don't wanna leave you!
You gotta come with us!

73
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,060
Pops!

74
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,370
Do you disobey your Captain's order?!

75
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,900
Why don't you just go, fools?!

76
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,280
Pops!

77
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,660
Now is our chance! Kill
Whitebeard! He's dying already!

78
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,300
Pops!

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,530
Hurry up! Let's do as Pops said!

80
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,890
You don't mind leaving Pops behind?!

81
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,630
Yeah, how dare you!

82
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,310
Stupid! No one wants to leave him alone!

83
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,330
Then...

84
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,810
Grumbling about it at a time

85
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,560
like this is the same as trampling
on Pops' determination!

86
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,240
Can't you understand?!

87
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,870
Pops!

88
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,250
Hurry and get ready to sail out!

89
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,950
Ace!

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,980
We're gonna leave soon! Come on now!

91
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,900
Commander Marco, let's go!

92
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,110
Pops...

93
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,450
--You messed with us!
--Die!

94
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,080
W-Wait! All I want is to get away!

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,880
I have no intention to fight...

96
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,360
W-What?!

97
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,300
My wax is as strong as steel!

98
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,300
There's no way that a
normal sword can cut it!

99
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,810
He's also a Devil Fruit eater!

100
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,300
No wonder!

101
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,040
He's strong enough to try to protect

102
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,060
"Fire Fist" even at Fleet Admiral Sengoku's elbow!

103
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,480
No no, don't overestimate me
like that! I'm not a big deal...

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,070
Oh no!

105
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,290
Damn Whitebeard!

106
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,090
I can't believe he still has that much
power after getting wounded so badly!

107
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,840
Since he isn't concerned about
"Fire Fist" Ace anymore...

108
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,890
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

109
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,640
It's clear his intention is to
sink Marineford into the ocean.

110
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,350
Along with himself!

111
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,530
Vice Admiral Garp! You're alive!

112
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,660
He wants to change the era?
Yeah, the time is right.

113
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,990
What happened to Whitebeard?!

114
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,250
His allies who have been
sold out are all dead now?!

115
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,500
Is the connection still out?!

116
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,790
How long should we wait?!

117
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,500
Damn! We couldn't see the whole picture

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,510
because Buggy the Clown stood in our way!

119
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,810
The guy over there must be...!

120
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,170
The great pirate--Captain Buggy the Clown?!

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,230
Yes, that's who I am indeed!

122
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,320
What did he want to say?!

123
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,410
If nothing is done, I can't report
anything to the head office!

124
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,660
What's going on at Marineford now?!

125
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,370
What?!

126
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,500
The Transponder Snail hasn't come out yet?!

127
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:52,050
Damn! Captain Buggy is about to beat
Whitebeard - it's no time for this!

128
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,680
Don't say it as if it's so easy!

129
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,930
He's dying but he still has boundless
power - didn't they see it?!

130
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,180
Why did I even say that I'm gonna beat
that man?! I really screwed this up!

131
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,400
I can't do it! It's impossible!

132
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,900
What?! We gotta broadcast Captain
Buggy's big moment all over the world!

133
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,240
Get it out at any cost!

134
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,660
--Come out now!
--Or we're gonna burn you out of it!

135
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,330
No, we gotta soak it into water!

136
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,250
--Let's do that!
--Come on!

137
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,040
--Stop it, fools!
--Huh?

138
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,590
It's not like he volunteered
to be a slave for the Navy.

139
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,090
But he got beaten up in the
battlefield like this.

140
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't you feel sorry for him?

141
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,060
Just let him go, okay?

142
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,540
Then we gotta cancel "Captain
Buggy's beating beard

143
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,110
and broadcast it live to the world" plan?!

144
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,610
No way! Even you want to
pull out from Marineford?!

145
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,160
I'm disappointed in you, Captain Buggy!

146
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,240
Oh no!

147
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,950
When it comes down to it,

148
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,890
they're all strong guys who've
been locked up in Impel Down!

149
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,380
I better not make enemies of them!

150
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,460
The Transponder Snail came out voluntarily!

151
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,130
Oh, he's...

152
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,220
...crying!

153
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,410
Oh yeah! He came out because he was
touched by Captain Buggy's kindness!

154
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,510
Captain Buggy can even win
the hearts of the Snails!

155
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,280
He's amazing as we thought!

156
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,780
That is the man who will conquer
the world - he's our Captain Buggy!

157
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,950
D-Damn bastard! Why didn't
he just stay inside?!

158
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,450
Now there's no way that I can back out!

159
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,700
Alright, let's begin!

160
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,330
Captain Buggy, make a declaration
to conquer the world now!

161
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,460
--It's your moment!
--Smoke: good, lighting: good!

162
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,130
Stand by!

163
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:02,300
Oh no, I mean... Dammit!
This leaves me one choice!

164
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,600
Alright, shoot my bravery!

165
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,520
Capture the moment that I kill Whitebeard!

166
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,400
--Hey, look!
--The picture's back!

167
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,110
But I can't see what's going
on because of the smoke!

168
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,070
Is the Navy losing?! What
happened to Whitebeard and Ace?!

169
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,910
--Um, well...
--Transponder Snail, go lower!

170
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,880
Hi, everyone! I'm Buggy and I'm a legend!

171
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,800
You again?!

172
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,090
Get to the sea now!

173
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,640
We who remain have to go back
to the New World safely!

174
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,020
Don't let them get away!
Kill as many as you can!

175
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,810
I'm the only one that you
ought to worry about!

176
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,900
Commander Jozu!

177
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,650
Looks like he's badly
injured but he'll make it!

178
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,020
Captain gave us an order! Come with us!

179
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,950
Brenheim! You gotta carry Jozu!

180
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,960
Straw boy! Why are you standing around?!

181
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,090
Ace, let's go! The old man
has made up his mind...

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,510
I know! And it won't be in vain!

183
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,350
Back off, you bastards!

184
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,110
We don't need words now.

185
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,140
Just tell me one thing.

186
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:41,130
Are you happy to have me as your father?

187
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,430
Still some fight left in you?

188
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,600
You are too valuable to let die now, boy.

189
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,590
If you still wanna run wild, run as wild
as you want on the sea under my name.

190
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,550
Become my son!

191
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,120
Of course I am!

192
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,450
Wh-What was that?!

193
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,870
--The scaffold was destroyed!
--So was the Navy HQ!

194
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,490
Did Ace get executed?! What's going on?!

195
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,330
Move the camera to Whitebeard!

196
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,710
I'm Buggy and I'm a legend!

197
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,120
The great pirate--Captain Buggy the Clown!

198
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,340
Is it true that you're
gonna beat Whitebeard?!

199
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,870
And with his head in your hand,

200
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,010
you're willing to become
one of The Four Emperors?!

201
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,980
I'm Buggy and I'm a legend!

202
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,810
You're just repeating that!

203
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,690
Say something forward-looking!
Let's do it again!

204
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,700
Enough with Buggy! Show us
Marineford as it stands!

205
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,820
Oh yeah!

206
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,410
You're not what we're interested in!

207
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,410
No, I mean... I just wanna
do something flashy...

208
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,630
What are you doing?!

209
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,760
Run! Run to the ship!

210
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,010
--Ace-san, Luffy-kun, get in front of me!
--Jimbei!

211
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,720
They want to get you two!

212
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,270
But what the good old man wants
is as many survivors as possible!

213
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,440
Good old man!

214
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,610
We've stolen a Navy ship! Get on board quick!

215
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,580
Do they really think that they can
get away?! How simple they are!

216
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,790
Admiral Sakazuki!

217
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,250
You guys, move aside a little bit!

218
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,180
You two, just keep going
until you get to the ship!

219
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,500
As soon as you rescue
"Fire Fist" Ace, you run!

220
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,270
The Whitebeards must be a group of cowards!

221
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,400
What?!

222
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,080
He's trying to stir you up obviously!

223
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,280
If you stop, you're playing into his hands!

224
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,470
Well your captain is that guy
so you can't help it, can you?

225
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,210
Because after all, Whitebeard is just a...

226
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,790
...loser from the old times!

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,210
Ace!

228
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,720
A loser?

229
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,940
Take back what you just said!

230
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,560
Hey, don't, Ace! Don't stop!

231
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,080
Just let him say whatever he wants!

232
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,280
He mocked Pops!

233
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,400
Ace!

234
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,430
Did you say "take it back?"

235
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,370
Not in a million years! I'll tell you why.

236
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,460
Your father Gold Roger
conquered the Grand Line

237
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,050
and opened the door to the new era called

238
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,130
the Great Pirate Era by sacrificing himself.

239
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,420
As a Navy admiral, it's
not my place to say so,

240
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,100
but he was true to his name:
the King of the Pirates!

241
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,480
In contrast, what has Whitebeard done?

242
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,670
I wonder if he really had
the intention to fight .

243
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,300
I assume that he established
a large family someplace

244
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,490
and was satisfied being a
big fish in a little barrel.

245
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,910
There are some fools in the world

246
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,360
who'd say that his name is
keeping peace on various islands

247
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,700
but if you ask me, he's just keeping
lightweights in fear of him

248
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,630
and he thinks that he's a
hero which makes me laugh!

249
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,090
When Roger was alive,
Whitebeard had second billing

250
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,850
and even after Roger's death,
he couldn't become a King.

251
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:48,060
That means he'll never better Roger
and he'll be a loser forever!

252
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,270
That's who Whitebeard
is and that's the truth.

253
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,890
He's a poor man when you think about it.

254
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,340
He gathered some punks who call him Pops

255
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,370
and roamed around the sea
with his fake family.

256
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,450
Stop it.

257
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,410
And although he reigned the sea for years,

258
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,500
he couldn't become a King and gained nothing

259
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,860
and at the end, he was stabbed by a fool,

260
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,300
one of his sons who fell for my line

261
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,760
and he will die to protect that son.

262
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,910
Don't you think that his life is so empty?

263
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Stop it!

264
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,520
Don't do it, Ace, come back!

265
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,060
Ace!

266
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,150
Pops gave us a place to live!

267
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,350
You can't understand his greatness!

268
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,950
People don't deserve to live
if they can't live justly!

269
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,790
Punks like you guys don't
deserve a place to live!

270
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,040
Stop it!

271
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,590
Whitebeard will die as a loser! It's
fitting for a big fish in a little barrel!

272
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,180
Whitebeard is a great pirate
who shaped this era!

273
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,640
Don't make fun of the man who saved me!

274
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,730
Don't do it, Ace!

275
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,980
The name of this era should be "Whitebeard!"

276
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,780
Both Whitebeard and you
guys who call him Pops

277
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,620
are the same after all--losers!

278
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,630
Ace has been burned!

279
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,700
Are you careless because you
ate a Logia type fruit which

280
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,770
is the most powerful of all?

281
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,020
You're just fire but my
magma can even burn fire!

282
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,570
My power is far stronger than yours.

283
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,610
Ace!

284
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,490
Hey, Luffy-kun, you should not fight anymore!

285
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,600
Ace's Vivre Card!

286
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,520
Gold Roger the King of the Pirates,
Dragon--the revolutionary.

287
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,810
I was amazed to hear that sons
of those two are step brothers.

288
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,670
You two have bad blood in your veins.

289
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,640
I don't care if the others get
away as long as I get you two!

290
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,600
Watch what I do.

291
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,440
Wait!

292
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,030
Luffy!

293
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,170
This is certainly a Vivre Card.

294
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,290
But I haven't told you that this card

295
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,630
also tells you how much
vital energy the owner has.

296
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,930
This card belongs to someone
who you care for, right?

297
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,930
Yeah, it's my brother's!

298
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,520
Hold onto it, always.

299
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,690
That paper will lead us to one another.

300
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,710
Ace is pierced by Akainu's
fist while protecting Luffy.

301
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,050
Jimbei and the Whitebeard
Pirates try to save him,

302
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,960
but Ace, realizing he is about to die,

303
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,730
finds the voice to convey his feelings
to his friends one last time.

304
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

305
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,980
"Looking for the Answer! Fire Fist Ace
Dies on the Battlefield!"

306
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
