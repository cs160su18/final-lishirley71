2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,560
You have as horrible
a reputation as ever.

25
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,060
That's fine. I am a pirate!

26
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,820
But Arlong's a reasonable guy.

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,020
Just a little more until our agreement.

28
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,570
No matter what, I'm going
to earn 100 million Berries

29
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,510
and buy this village!

30
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,730
"Usopp Dead?! When is Luffy
Going to Make Landfall?"

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,440
Go! To Arlong Park!

32
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,710
Hang on, Nami!

33
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Let go! Let go, I said!

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,350
Have they still not caught
that Long-nose yet?!

35
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,400
A mere, lowly human,
defying our species!

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,430
We're returning to Arlong Park!

37
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,460
Damn! I can't lose 'em!

38
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,780
W-Where is he?

39
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,710
Who thinks Usopp-sama is too
important of a person to have die yet?!

40
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,130
Me!

41
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,280
Me! Me! Me! Me!

42
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,030
Fool! What are you thinking?!

43
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,260
Oh, you guys think so, too? I agree!

44
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
W-What?

45
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,250
Special Attack: Egg Star!

46
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,290
Rotten eggs!

47
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,760
I can't breathe!

48
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,660
Howdya like that?! I guess fishmen
aren't all they're cracked up to be!

49
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,430
Looks like every one of 'em
let Captain Usopp escape!

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,600
Y-Yikes. I somehow
wound up at a shore!

51
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,420
--I heard his voice over here!
--Let's check it out!

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
No one here.
Was it just our imagination?

53
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,880
The guy's quick to run away,
that's for sure!

54
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,350
Let's look somewhere else!

55
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,350
Whew...

56
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,000
I-I don't know!

57
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,170
It's not in your best interest to lie.

58
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,650
Oww...

59
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,100
Huh? What?

60
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,410
Thanks for your cheering!

61
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,530
As you can see, I'm perfectly okay!

62
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,700
Maybe a little too okay?

63
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,820
Yeah...

64
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,750
What's taking so long?!

65
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,300
When is Luffy gonna show up?!

66
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,540
Five more minutes
and I'm gonna die of boredom!

67
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,880
Ohh! Oh!

68
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,410
Oh! Incredible!

69
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,820
Not even Hatchan, major octopus
leader of the Arlong Pirates,

70
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,220
can pull you up!

71
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,550
You're a super-grade fish!

72
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,630
Dunno who you are, but you're
the gutsiest fish in the East Blue!

73
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,970
What the... Oh! It was me all along?

74
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,290
You're indeed the gutsiest
fish in the East Blue, me.

75
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,450
Wait, does that seem strange?

76
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,130
Sure does.

77
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,420
W-Who are you?!

78
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,410
Me? I'm Hatchan!

79
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,180
Call me Hachi!

80
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,950
You a fishman, too?

81
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,220
Of course, of course!
I'm a fascinating octopus fishman!

82
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,530
From the looks of it, you're a human?

83
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,330
Y-Yeah.

84
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,150
A marine? Or maybe a guest?

85
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,530
Guest?

86
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
I guess you could say I'm a guest.

87
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Arlong-san's not here right now, is he?

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,670
Nope. Where'd he go?

89
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:14,180
Apparently, there's a long-nosed
outsider running all over the place.

90
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,780
He locked up his friend here

91
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,870
and went to Cocoyashi Village
to get this other guy.

92
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,570
Usopp, huh?

93
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,170
Guess I'll save him for now.

94
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,290
This Cocoyashi Village...

95
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,150
How do I get there?

96
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,230
Get in.

97
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,670
You're a guest.
I'll take you there, swordsman!

98
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,190
W-What the hell happened?!

99
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,720
What happened here...

100
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,000
...my brothers?!

101
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,580
Roronoa...

102
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,630
What? What are you trying to say?!

103
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,870
Roronoa Zoro...

104
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,850
What?!

105
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,800
The pirate hunter?!
Did he come to collect my head?!

106
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,060
N-No, he didn't come... T-That guy...

107
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,240
He was Zoro!

108
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
What?!

109
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,780
That haramaki guy
we caught was Roronoa...

110
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,380
I caught him, Arlong-san!

111
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,230
W-What in the world?!

112
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,500
Took you long enough, Choo.

113
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,840
D-Don't tell me Zoro--

114
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
Well, here we are!

115
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,260
Cocoyashi Village.

116
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,840
Arlong-san should be here.

117
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,280
Great. Thanks.

118
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,640
No problem! Bye, now!

119
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,090
Whoops! I just remembered,
I forgot to ask your name!

120
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,730
Huh? Me? What are you
asking my name again for?

121
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,130
It's Hatchan!

122
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,750
Come back again!

123
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,620
Strange guy.

124
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,920
Catching this scum isn't
enough to satisfy my hunger!

125
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,290
Y-Yeah, huh?! So you should let me go!

126
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,910
I was just saying hello earlier!

127
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,720
T-That's how we do it in my village!

128
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,440
But you are one of Zoro's men.

129
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,640
Though, it's only natural for famous
bounty hunters to come after me.

130
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,950
Don't kill me! I don't have
anything to do with Zoro!

131
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,740
Enough of your poor lies.
You stood up to Arlong-san, too.

132
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,420
Doesn't look like you're
going to live either way.

133
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,430
H-Hey! As a matter of fact,
Zoro and I are really close!

134
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,300
So just try and lay a finger on me!
Zoro won't stand by quietly!

135
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,880
Oh? Which means if I kill you,
Zoro will come back?

136
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,900
N-No, you're wrong!

137
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,940
Killing me'd be very bad!
If you keep me alive, Zoro'll show up!

138
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,760
But if you don't keep me alive,
Zoro won't come!

139
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,940
But how exactly did Zoro...

140
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,660
...escape from our prison?

141
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,190
What do you mean?

142
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,790
What I mean is, someone let him escape.

143
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,320
Arlong-san. Does this
sound plausible to you?

144
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,930
Perhaps Nami let Zoro infiltrate
this place so he could take your head?

145
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,070
N-Now that you mention it,
Nami has been acting strange lately.

146
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,070
Yeah. She even helped Zoro
when he jumped into the water.

147
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,270
Don't tell me she was working
with Zoro from the very start...

148
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,800
...and tricked us all?!

149
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,020
Betrayal is her specialty.

150
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,220
That's enough of that!

151
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,070
Quit discussing stuff based
on a bunch of conjecture!

152
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,250
Nami...

153
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,940
Watch what you say!

154
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,510
Me, a traitor?

155
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:59,020
I swore I was a member of this group
eight years ago, with this tattoo!

156
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,000
Sorry, sorry.

157
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,720
Nami. It's only natural
for you to be upset.

158
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,010
But rest easy.
I don't suspect you one bit.

159
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,400
You and me've known each
other for eight years now!

160
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,250
We were just a little on edge is all.

161
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,000
Right, Nami?

162
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,960
The ones we do need to get rid of
are Roronoa Zoro and his group!

163
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,890
H-Hey, Nami! S-Say something!

164
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,560
Nami!

165
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,690
Zoro just had to go and do that...

166
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,930
What's wrong, Nami?

167
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,900
You seem a little pale.

168
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,430
But, as for Long-nose here...

169
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,810
...not even you can save him now.

170
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,650
Not after he's defied Arlong-san.

171
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,890
How long...

172
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,450
How long are you going to suspect me?!

173
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,390
You're too smart, you see.

174
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,430
I'll have the amount
Arlong and I agreed to soon!

175
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,310
Why would I betray you now?!

176
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,340
Agreed amount?!

177
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,690
I know.

178
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,840
You agreed eight years ago to buy
Cocoyashi Village from Arlong-san

179
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,170
for 100 million Berries.

180
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,230
But I just can't make sense of it.

181
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,900
You betrayed the villagers
and your parent,

182
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,720
and only trust money,

183
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
so why do you care so much
about Cocoyashi Village?

184
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,920
Why such a puny little village?

185
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,210
Actually, I found this...

186
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,300
in your room.

187
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,010
T-That's my...

188
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,810
S-Say what?!

189
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,820
Usopp's been captured?!

190
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,310
Yeah! They took him to
Arlong Park a little while ago!

191
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,400
Brave as he was,
that youngster defied Arlong!

192
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,820
He's surely dead by now!

193
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,770
Damn.

194
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,020
Of all times to get caught, it had
to be after I killed some time there!

195
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,420
Usopp! Stay alive!

196
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,810
Is this a treasure map?

197
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,280
It seems to be pointing
to Cocoyashi Village...

198
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,240
Treasure in Cocoyashi Village?!

199
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,220
Really?!

200
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,990
That's my own personal map!

201
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,390
It has nothing to do with you at all!

202
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,200
Oh! What's wrong?
You suddenly look so furious...

203
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,600
What is this?!

204
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,250
What in the world happened here?!

205
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,460
It's the work of Roronoa Zoro,
the pirate hunter!

206
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,130
But where were you, Hachi?!

207
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,080
This could've been prevented,
had you been here!

208
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,590
Of course it could've!
Had I only been here!

209
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,930
This is unforgivable!

210
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,640
Meaning you don't know
where Zoro disappeared to?

211
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,450
Well, all I saw was one
slightly suspicious swordsman

212
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,360
whom I'd never met before...

213
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,490
It was him?!

214
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,710
You did see him, you idiot!

215
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,410
So, where did Zoro go?!

216
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,870
He wanted to see Arlong-san,

217
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,960
so I just took him to Cocoyashi Village!

218
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,590
Meaning there's no reason
to rush out in a hurry.

219
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,730
He's looking for me, too.

220
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,380
He said he was a guest
of yours, you see.

221
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,870
And I didn't think you'd be
back so soon, Arlong-san...

222
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,250
Zoro, huh?!

223
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,560
Which means, if I can just
buy me a little more time...

224
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,170
Why are you getting in the way?!

225
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
Everything's so close to working out!

226
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,740
So close!

227
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,180
D-Damn you! You picking a fight?!

228
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,230
You're getting in the way!
You're the one to blame!

229
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,680
This is what you get
for messing with Arlong!

230
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,900
Nami! You really disappoint me!

231
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,820
Even after you stole
our ship and ran off,

232
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,790
Luffy didn't suspect you one bit!

233
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,020
Even now, he completely trusts you!

234
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,290
How can you trick someone like
that with such an uncaring look?!

235
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,600
The only thing I trust is money.
Those who get fooled are the fools!

236
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,910
Say what?!

237
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,340
Everything was
supposed to go smoothly.

238
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,530
You guys are going to make my
eight years of business meaningless.

239
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,470
So the least I can do is
get rid of you by my own hand!

240
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,560
Seems you've become a lot more
pirate-like since you were last here!

241
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,820
Get rid of?

242
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,350
You, get rid of me?!
Don't make me laugh!

243
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,610
I wouldn't underestimate
me if I were you.

244
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,580
Dammit...

245
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,650
If I stay here, I'm dead for sure!

246
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,450
Special Attack!

247
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,950
Smoke Star!

248
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,480
Bastard used a smoke bomb!

249
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Surround him! Don't let him escape!

250
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Now's my chance!

251
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,580
This is just like
something you'd think up.

252
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,010
Nami!

253
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,540
D-Don't...

254
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,550
It's for my business!

255
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,730
This was my only choice!

256
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,460
N-Nami... How could you...

257
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,620
Die like a good little boy.

258
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,560
--Way to go, Nami!
--Way to get revenge!

259
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,300
Now that's why you're a
leader of the Arlong Pirates!

260
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,560
B-Big Sis Nami k-killed Big Bro Usopp!

261
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,650
That's what you wanted, right?
To die at sea...

262
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,470
Nami. I'm sorry for doubting you.

263
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,030
You're our friend.

264
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,530
Friend?

265
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,780
I have no friends!

266
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,920
There's only one reason
why I joined this group!

267
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,420
To buy Cocoyashi Village!

268
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,030
Keep your part of the bargain!

269
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,090
I'll have the 100 million Berries soon!

270
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,430
But of course.

271
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,470
I'd rather cut my belly open and die

272
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,380
than break a promise
concerning money.

273
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,100
That's the kind of man I am.

274
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,900
Glad to hear it, Arlong.
You know the score.

275
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,920
She's one creepy girl.

276
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,600
What a truly great
woman she's become!

277
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,340
A witch! She's really a witch!

278
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,140
There it is! Arlong Park!

279
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,840
Hey! Don't get tired, cow!

280
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,050
Yeah, Big Bro Sanji's kicks
must've really taken their toll!

281
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,000
Hey! Not that way!
To the left! That building!

282
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,170
After I've come so far...

283
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,300
I've endured eight whole
years since that day...

284
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,130
Alright! As of today, this is your room!

285
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,350
Your desk, your pens...

286
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,150
Everything you'll need is here!

287
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,610
I endured it all this time...

288
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,880
so I had no other choice than to do that!

289
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,670
It's almost like we're flying!

290
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,720
Not "like"!

291
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,260
We are flying, dumbass!

292
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,020
W-We're falling!

293
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,020
Landing successful!

294
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,450
Yo! Zoro!

295
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,600
We made it! We made it!

296
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,140
W-What the hell...

297
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,630
are you guys doing?!

298
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,660
What do you mean?
We're here to get Nami.

299
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,610
Have you still not found her?

300
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,550
Oh, yeah! And what about
Usopp and Johnny?

301
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,600
Usopp!

302
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,130
T-That's right! There's no time
to be loafing around here!

303
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,570
What's wrong?!

304
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,550
That bastard's been caught by Arlong!

305
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,650
We gotta hurry before he's killed!

306
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,870
He was killed!

307
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,750
What?!

308
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,830
We're too late...

309
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,090
Big Bro Usopp is dead!

310
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,770
He was killed!

311
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,000
By Big Sis Nami!

312
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,120
Am I...

313
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,300
a ghost?

314
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,830
My overflowing feelings don't connect

315
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,670
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

316
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,590
I'll set off by myself,

317
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,550
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

318
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,270
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

319
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,370
Why is it so hot?

320
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:55,370
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

321
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,670
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

322
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,510
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

323
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:11,260
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

324
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,610
With you, I can run there

325
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,850
Nami would never kill Usopp!
We're friends!

326
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,980
Who're friends?

327
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,400
N-Nami-san! It's me!
Do you remember?!

328
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,370
--Why are you here?!
--To get you!

329
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,220
--Hey! Where's Usopp?!
--Bottom of the ocean.

330
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,780
Damn it! Cut the crap!

331
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,710
Shut up! Get the hell out, outsiders!
You're an eyesore!

332
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,880
On the next episode of One Piece!

333
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,050
"Everyone's Gathered!
Usopp Speaks the Truth About Nami"

334
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
