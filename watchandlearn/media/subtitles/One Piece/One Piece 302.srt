00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,000
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,790
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,400
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,370
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,340
Just watch carefully!

35
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,400
This is the first step of a hero
that will be engraved in histo...

36
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,450
Tower of Law?! What can
he do from that far away?!

37
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,420
--Snap!
--Who the hell is that?!

38
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,890
--♪ I was born... ♪
--He's aiming at us from that distance
without the slightest error, in this wind?!

39
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,370
--♪ ...on the island of snipers ♪
--Who the hell is that?!

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,890
Long-nose!

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,270
Nico Robin is getting away!

42
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,550
Don't let her get away!
Idiots! You can shoot her!

43
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,800
--Yes, sir!
--Shoot her dead enough to keep her alive!

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,310
Huh?!

45
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,230
Fire!

46
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,500
What?!

47
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,510
What the hell is he?!

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,470
You are...

49
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,970
My body is strong because it's iron.

50
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,560
That landmine wasn't nice, Spanda!

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,810
Eek!

52
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,060
They came off!

53
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,490
This is Franky! Hey, Long-nose!

54
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,490
I got the handcuffs off of Nico Robin.

55
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,950
All right!

56
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,530
Thank you, Long-nose!

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,120
You can thank those who fought hard
to gather the keys when this is all over.

58
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,760
You are, without a doubt,
one of Luffy-kun's gang!

59
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,490
You can now do as you wish!

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,130
Yes.

61
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,720
Everything went according to my plan.

62
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,890
Hm? What's that?

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,030
Did I hear something just now?

64
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,740
"Robin Freed! Luffy vs. Lucci,
Showdown Between Leaders"

65
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,110
What...?

66
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,610
What the heck?

67
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,690
Can't be...!

68
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,650
Was that cannon fire from a battleship?!

69
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,230
The stockade was...

70
00:05:51,200 --> 00:06:04,670
"Justice"

71
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,480
Vice Admiral! The cannon
fire earlier hit the stockade

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,440
in front of the main island at 4 o'clock!

73
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,480
--So, what about it?
--Huh?

74
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,660
I'm asking, what about it?

75
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,670
Yes, sir. Well, nothing really, sir!

76
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,250
This is an indiscriminate attack.
I could care less where we hit.

77
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,140
Yes, sir...

78
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,010
Our mission is to burn everything down.

79
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,940
Start with the Tower of Law.

80
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,020
Once Enies Lobby comes within firing range,
we'll launch a concerted attack.

81
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,120
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,210
If that's clear, instead of
wasting time on reports like this,

83
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,650
why don't you start preparing
the next attack already?!

84
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,520
Y-Yes, sir!

85
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,810
They busted the fence
that surrounds the island.

86
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,330
That was a huge explosion.

87
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,090
If a bunch of battleships come and
rain down cannon fire like that...

88
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,400
Also, look.

89
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,340
The whirlpools that were surging so violently

90
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,250
that they prevented ships from
coming here are now completely gone.

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,810
It's because the Gates of Justice were
opened all the way to allow attacks.

92
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:06,780
"Sea Currents"
"Tower of Law"

93
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,250
Those whirlpools were generated by the

94
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,560
sea currents blocked by the huge gates.

95
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,000
Now that the gates are open

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,460
and nothing is blocking them,

97
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,820
the sea currents went back to normal

98
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,780
and the whirlpools disappeared, huh?

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,740
Which means, the battleships...

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,220
...will have no trouble coming this way.

101
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,650
--Sogeking!
--There's no time to lose!

102
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,120
Jump down from there!

103
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,960
Don't say a reckless thing like that!

104
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,650
To start with, it's not like I have
superhuman strength like you guys,

105
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,840
or the courage not to fear death!

106
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,210
I'm just an ordinary superhero!

107
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,800
Hm?

108
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,890
Usopp!

109
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,310
The Tower of Law is...

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,900
Long-nose!

111
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,100
Long-nose...!

112
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,930
Look! This time, they fired at the Tower of Law!

113
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,070
The Tower of Law is...!

114
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,030
Are they okay?!

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,550
As I suspected, the explosion
earlier was no ordinary explosion!

116
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,430
That was cannon fire!

117
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,960
Hurry up and leave the island!

118
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,230
Hey... He couldn't have... right?

119
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,550
Hey! Usopp!

120
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,090
Ahhh!!

121
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,600
You called?!

122
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,230
Hey, you're alive!

123
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,320
Hey! Don't you guys have
the kindness to catch a hero

124
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,490
making a desperate jump
off of the rooftop?! Morons!

125
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,620
Franky! Robin-chan! We're okay here.
We're heading over there right away!

126
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,620
Good.

127
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,950
Well then, let's do something
about things here.

128
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,610
Hey, can I count on you to help fight?

129
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,080
Of course.

130
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,050
Hurry up, soldiers! Take care of them
before the attack goes into full gear!

131
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,840
Yes, sir!

132
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,650
There's an escort ship on the
other side of the bridge, huh?

133
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,490
Don't you think that is the key to our escape?

134
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,720
Looks like stealing that ship
is our only chance of surviving.

135
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,680
Get them!

136
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,480
Dieciseis Fleurs!

137
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,430
Fire!

138
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,870
What the hell?!

139
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,700
Strong...

140
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,940
...Face-Slap!

141
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,150
Second group! Go!

142
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,090
Yeah!

143
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,560
Treinta Fleurs!

144
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,440
Master Nails!

145
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,650
Th-Third group! Go!

146
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,620
Fourth group! And fifth group, too!
All together, get them!

147
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,120
Geez... One after another...
They're such a pain in the ass.

148
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
Hey, stand back a little.

149
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,310
Weapons Left!

150
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,220
Fresh Fire!

151
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,140
Franky Boxing!

152
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,560
Yow!

153
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,140
What offensive power...!

154
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,170
We can't possibly fight back.

155
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,640
Not enough for you? Then... Franky...

156
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,210
...Convert!

157
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,720
Franky Centaur!

158
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,080
He's a horse!

159
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,250
No, wait. He's not a horse.
His upper body is attached in the back!

160
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,600
Then he's a monster!

161
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,780
Hold it, you bastards!

162
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,650
I said hold it, bastards!

163
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,410
Hey, you idiots! Don't run away! Fight him!

164
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,240
Ow, ow, ow...!

165
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,870
H-Help!

166
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,320
Hey, escort ship! Send some
reinforcements in! Now!

167
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,580
Yes, sir! How many do you need?

168
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,590
How many do I need?! You idiot!

169
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,300
Listen! Two vicious criminals
have removed their handcuffs

170
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,190
and escaped, and are
now going on a rampage!

171
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,090
The ship's captain, navigator,
signalmen, corpsmen...

172
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,550
All of you! Come out and...

173
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,160
Understood, sir! We'll all work
together and capture the...

174
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,120
...protect me!

175
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,540
So this is about you?!

176
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,600
Chimney! Gonbe! Let's hurry!

177
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,480
Grandma! You're fast!

178
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,030
The power of alcohol is amazing, huh?!

179
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,440
The truth is, it's not really
because of the alcohol.

180
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,310
--What?
--I'm having fun, so...

181
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,040
This is the first time I've felt this
way since Tom-san was still alive.

182
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,380
What's funny, you horned raccoon dog?!

183
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,590
Who're you taking it out on, Moron-ky?!
You are not gonna get away with it!

184
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,890
How about you guys?

185
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,180
Yeah! It's kinda exciting!

186
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,660
This is fun! This is fun! The pirate guy is fun!

187
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,580
Kokoro-san! Chimney! Gonbe!

188
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,820
Thanks for the guide marks!

189
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,490
Pirate lady!

190
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
I felt quite a shock just a moment ago.

191
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,930
Looks like it's finally gonna start, huh?!

192
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,050
Cannon fire! Cannon fire!

193
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,840
Shave!

194
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,130
You jerk!

195
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,850
Jet Pistol!

196
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,110
Jet Whip!

197
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,200
Shave!

198
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,370
Finger Pistol!

199
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,660
Yellow Lotus!

200
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,970
Jet Stamp!

201
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,070
His physical ability is as good
as that of a Six Powers Master.

202
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,010
He surely seems like a different person
from the time I met him at Galley-La.

203
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,980
That rising steam...
That strange red tint his body has...

204
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,350
What's going on in his body?

205
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,730
Oh, I get it!

206
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,660
Razor!

207
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,210
Jet Pistol!

208
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,880
I see...

209
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,160
So, it's basically like doping.

210
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,970
You accelerate your blood circulation
by using your legs as a pump.

211
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,960
The blood pressure gets so high that
a normal person's heart would explode,

212
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,330
but since your internal organs and veins
are all rubber-made, you can bear it.

213
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,800
That's a technique only a rubber man can use.

214
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,750
Although your physical ability
indeed spikes, exceeding its limits,

215
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,260
your physical strength itself just
can't keep up with that intensification.

216
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,400
That's not really smart.
You're shortening your life, you know that?

217
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,230
It's better than losing all sorts
of things right before my eyes!

218
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,250
I'll do whatever I can do!

219
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,690
You're too ambitious!

220
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,930
Did you feel the explosion earlier?

221
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,860
That was probably a Navy Headquarters
battleship doing some trial fire.

222
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,410
Before too long, they'll all start firing at once.

223
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,540
Your friends who are in the
Tower of Law will die there.

224
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,210
Even if there are some lucky ones

225
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,090
who are running this way in the
underground passage right now...

226
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,630
Tempest Kick!

227
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,640
What?!

228
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,070
This seawater will gush into the passage,

229
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,190
ensuring that anyone in there will drown.

230
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,040
You...

231
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,180
Nothing is going well for you, Straw Hat.

232
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,790
That naive idea of yours that you
can save everyone and escape...

233
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,140
Let's see how far it gets you.

234
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,600
What're you doing, you jerk?!

235
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,090
Dammit! They're persistent.

236
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,670
Based solely on the head count,
they're like a first-class military force.

237
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,110
Hurry up!

238
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,350
All you have to do is capture Nico Robin
and put her on the escort ship!

239
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,930
Move it! The battleships are coming!

240
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,050
Looks like it's too late.

241
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,390
What'd you say?!

242
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,350
Ah!

243
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,480
Ahh!

244
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,990
Behind the fog...

245
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,510
...we can see the outline of the ships!

246
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,500
H-Hey, don't run away! Wait!

247
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,980
Oh, no...

248
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,320
This serves you right!

249
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,230
They're here! They're finally here!

250
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Th-They're here! The cannon fire has started!

251
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,170
Watch out!

252
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,390
Run!

253
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,830
Get us out of here!

254
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,950
I know!

255
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,840
A Buster Call has been invoked!

256
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,660
Our targets are Straw Hat Luffy
and his gang of about sixty pirates!

257
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,780
However, due to a private agreement with
Admiral Aokiji, the criminal Nico Robin,

258
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,810
last sighted on the Bridge of Hesitation,

259
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,440
is a sole exception to this
and is not one of our targets.

260
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,340
There's no need to assess the current situation!

261
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,220
Completely destroy the
judicial island, Enies Lobby!

262
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,770
All battleships, take your positions!

263
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,840
A fleet of battleships!

264
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,090
The Buster Call has begun!

265
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,370
Boss! There's trouble! There's trouble!

266
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,680
Oh, what's the matter?
Did you get hay fever or something?

267
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,760
Yeah. My nose tickles and my eyes are itchy.
I really don't know what to do!

268
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,580
Hey, that's not it!

269
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,930
The famous millennium cherry tree is gone!

270
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,810
What'd you say?! That really is trouble!

271
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

272
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,240
"Boss Luffy Is the Culprit?
Track Down the Missing Great Cherry Tree"

273
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,430
I'm gonna be a policeman!!
