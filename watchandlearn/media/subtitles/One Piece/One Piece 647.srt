00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980
Running at full speed

We can't wait until the
morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

something - that's the treasure

We are the one! Go ahead!

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

burning, intense excitement!

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,130

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,610
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,510
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,900
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,780
When Luffy found out that the prize for

77
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,250
a fighting event was the Flare-Flare
Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,320
"Light and Shadow!
Darkness behind Dressrosa!"

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,790
It seems like those famous tough warriors
have been knocked out by...

80
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,820
...the impact from the epic
clash of those two men

81
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,990
and have been taken out of the fight!

82
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,970
But what did we actually see?!

83
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,930
I didn't know you could use Conqueror's Haki!

84
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,510
What kind of king are you dreaming to become?!

85
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,210
The King of the Pirates!

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,780
Shut up!

87
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,230
There are so many in the New World
who can use that power!

88
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,250
And only battling it out amongst you all
will determine the winner!

89
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,010
The strongest among a legion of "Conquerors"!

90
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,560
That's who the King of the Pirates is!

91
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,740
Who taught you how to use the Haki?

92
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,760
Rayleigh!

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,380
Is he still alive?!

94
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,580
How annoying!

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,050
I don't even want to think about
what happened in the past!

96
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,810
He landed a powerful kick against Lucy!

97
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,730
Even though he's already retired,

98
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,530
the strength of the 12th leader
of the Happo Navy remains!

99
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,930
What?

100
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,670
Whaaat?!

101
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,440
Tell me, Straw Hat.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,210
I want to forget but it's always
right there in front of me!

103
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,910
But it's out of my reach! My treasure!

104
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,320
Can you imagine anything harder than that?!

105
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,590
What's going on?! The legendary pirate is...

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,920
...crying!

107
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,350
Grandpa...

108
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,840
I thought the plan was to
let Sai move into the final!

109
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,900
I'm still not strong enough.

110
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,610
Nobody can stop him once he's at it!

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,580
"Chinjao the Drill."

112
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,450
That's what they used to
call me but not anymore.

113
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,570
Answer me!

114
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,930
Do you know what Garp has done to me?!

115
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,400
I told you - I don't know!

116
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,570
Since you're that bastard Garp's
grandson, I can't just let you

117
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,640
walk away because you have no idea!

118
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,780
For 30 years,

119
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,050
I've been holding a grudge!

120
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,570
He's showing his fighting spirit again!

121
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,760
Don Chinjao!

122
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,920
Say it, Straw Hat!
What has Garp done to me?!

123
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,800
What did he take away from me?!

124
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,110
He's crying again!

125
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,730
This old man is such a pain in the ass.

126
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,520
I can't tell if he wants to cry or be mad.

127
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,110
Go Lucy! Now's the chance!

128
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,700
Luffy-dono!

129
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,880
I don't have time for this!

130
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,290
Sanji-dono, I want to get to the

131
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,760
Toy House to rescue Kanjuro already!

132
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,700
I wanna help you with that
but you have to wait.

133
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,310
We have a situation here.

134
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,790
Look how many Navy soldiers
there are around the Colosseum.

135
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,990
Why are there so many?

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,720
It seems like pirates and criminals are
freely entering this competition.

137
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,260
The Navy is here to catch them
as they come out.

138
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,960
Well, criminals should be caught.

139
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,520
Don't forget that you
were on the pirate ship!

140
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,670
Oh yeah!

141
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,010
We have to tell Luffy about this situation

142
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,680
but the entrance for the competitors is
completely closed off.

143
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,970
What's going on here-dara?

144
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,410
No one has come out
from the Colosseum yet-dara?

145
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,980
No, sir. Not yet.

146
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,720
There must be hundreds of losers
from Block A and B-dara!

147
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,110
Why hasn't even a single one of them
come out-dara?

148
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,790
It's strange.

149
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,230
Vice Admiral Maynard went undercover as a competitor

150
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:55,230
"SHARK SLICER" BASTILLE
- A NAVY VICE ADMIRAL

151
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,590
but we haven't had any contact with him for a while.

152
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,580
Why did he do that on his own?

153
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,250
That punk!

154
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,520
Is something going on...

155
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,950
...in the Colosseum-dara?

156
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,790
Here in Dressrosa, there are two laws...

157
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,850
...that people have obeyed strictly

158
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,430
since Doflamingo came to the throne 10 years ago.

159
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,340
--Two laws?
--Yes.

160
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,050
First, lights should be out by midnight.

161
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,930
Citizens must not go out after that.

162
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,610
What?! Even adults?!

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,850
Humans have to go back to their homes

164
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,830
and toys have to go back to their toy houses.

165
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,620
No one's allowed to go out after midnight.

166
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,260
You can't even go for a drink!

167
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,190
Everything is closed anyway.

168
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,990
Second,

169
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,760
toys must not enter human's houses

170
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,230
and humans must not enter toy's houses!

171
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,770
What?!

172
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,740
It looks like they're
friendly with each other

173
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,120
but that's prohibited?!

174
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,800
But if that's the sad boundary between

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,010
artifacts and living things, it can't be helped.

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,340
Well, come to think of it,
I'm kind of getting used to it already but...

177
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,020
...what kind of toys are you guys?

178
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,180
You have free will and you can talk.

179
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,140
Whoever made you all should
be a genius like Vegapunk.

180
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,060
Who was it?

181
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,970
Somebody, call the police!

182
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,740
What's going on?!

183
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,370
--Please! Let go of me!
--Esta, it's me!

184
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,170
The toy's broken! It's got "human disorder"!

185
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,170
Listen to me! It's not that!

186
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,240
Don't you remember, Esta?!

187
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
It's me!

188
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,220
Get away from me! You're freaking me out!

189
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,160
What happened all of a sudden?!

190
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,950
You've been friendly with her until now!

191
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,790
Please! Try to remember!

192
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,730
Get away from her!

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,130
Come with us!

194
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,970
Damn!

195
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,270
Esta! I'm your boyfriend!

196
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,070
Don't hook up with that bastard!

197
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,340
You know who I am! Remember me!

198
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,930
--Let go of me! Dammit!
--Calm down!

199
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,200
Don't!

200
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,400
No! Don't!

201
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,740
No! Let go of me, you bastards!

202
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm a human!

203
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,600
That was scary!

204
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,940
Boy...

205
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,350
I can't believe that toy thinks he's a human.

206
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,450
I know.

207
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,760
What was it all about?

208
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,460
Let me ride you, Onepoko!

209
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,040
No-wan! You're too heavy now-wan!

210
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,220
Onepoko!

211
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm not heavy!
Onepoko!

212
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,090
Let me go talk to him.

213
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,280
Don't worry. He's a toy, too.

214
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,540
Well, yeah, a half of me is.

215
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,620
Hmmm, Onepoko's got it!

216
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,560
Who are you?

217
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,230
I'm that boy's father.
And that woman is my wife.

218
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,140
My name is Milo, not Onepoko.

219
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,630
Hey boy, don't you have a daddy?

220
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,210
Huh? No, I don't!

221
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,250
Do you have a husband?

222
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,050
No, I don't. I'm not married.

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,350
It's not so unusual, is it?

224
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,720
Bye bye!

225
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:10,070
Hey soldier, what's your point?
What's going on here?

226
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,670
What I wanted to show you is...

227
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,710
...this country is filled
with both the forgotten

228
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,910
and those who forgot them!

229
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,380
All of us toys were once humans!

230
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,790
What?!

231
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,160
A Devil Fruit eater
who Doflamingo brought 10 years ago,

232
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,930
turned us to toys!

233
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,900
Hey! That means you were...

234
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,530
There!

235
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,780
I see the Flower Field!
I'll tell you everything there!

236
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,910
Although he's already retired,

237
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,180
his Eight-Impact Fist is still
as sharp as it used to be!

238
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,100
He is full of fight spirit! Don Chinjao!

239
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,750
He's been fighting so hard
but his Haki hasn't weakened at all!

240
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,820
How tenacious you are, Grandpa!

241
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,860
I'm gonna avenge my head with my head!

242
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,500
Avenge your head?
What are you talking about?

243
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,250
Take this as payment for what he did to me!

244
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,370
Here it goes! Head-Arms!

245
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,970
Gum-Gum Balloon!

246
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,040
What?!

247
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,010
Chinjao's been deflected off of Lucy!

248
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,050
Oh, that was close!

249
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,690
But it didn't work for him!

250
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,850
Dammit! If I were still "Chinjao the Drill"
like people used to call me,

251
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm sure I could have taken
him down with that one!

252
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,560
Not just my treasure and fortune

253
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,470
but Garp also took my strength away!

254
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,840
I'm gonna get back at him after 30 years!

255
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,020
I said...

256
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,720
..."Talk to...

257
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,300
...my grandpa"!

258
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,010
Did it work this time?!

259
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,630
Did he knock him out?!

260
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,880
Chinjao isn't moving a bit!

261
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,910
N-No, it didn't work this time either!

262
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,560
You, Straw Hat!

263
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,480
Wh...

264
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,530
What the hell?!

265
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,290
Wow! Chinjao, is he gonna attack like that?!

266
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,620
What kind of technique is it?!

267
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,390
Eight-Impact Fist! Head-Arms Spin!

268
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,600
Go, grandpa!

269
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,920
Old man, beat him up!
In the name of Eight-Impact Fist!

270
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,020
I'm gonna make you pay! Stop me if you can!

271
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,720
I don't know why you're mad at my grandpa

272
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,950
but I have to win this thing!

273
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,430
Here I go!

274
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,600
Gum-Gum...

275
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,670
...Gatling!

276
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,430
Now it's the one-on-one fight between

277
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,410
the remaining two - Lucy and Don Chinjao!

278
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,620
Which one is going to...

279
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,180
...win the Block C match!

280
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,540
GREEN BIT

281
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,200
Why are you trying to buy time, Law?

282
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,140
I'm sure he's up to something again.

283
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,350
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

284
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,060
What is she doing?! Pick up already!

285
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,980
You have no mercy!

286
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,520
I'm all thumbs so...

287
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,610
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

288
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,230
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

289
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,860
Why is she not picking up?! Nami-ya!

290
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,650
I know I'm not calling the wrong number!

291
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,600
It's Usoland's Haki!

292
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,460
So powerful!

293
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,820
We need tension rods for the shelf -
it's gonna fall over.

294
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,590
Leo, are you ready to go? Do you need lunch?

295
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,500
Grandma, I'm sure there is something
to eat at the headquarters.

296
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,510
Yeah?

297
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,960
Grandma!

298
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,030
Oh yeah, I'm gonna sew up everything
that might fall over!

299
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,080
Okay, now it's safe!

300
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,730
I can't believe how powerful the hero is!

301
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,170
He can shake up the whole kingdom
with the thing called Haki!

302
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,090
That's right!

303
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,920
Because Usoland is the legendary hero!

304
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,860
By the way, Leo, I won't fall
over even though I look weak.

305
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,170
So this is the Tontatta Kingdom.

306
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,080
What kind of relationship do they
have with the Warlord Doflamingo?

307
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,180
Whatever it is,
they're serious about fighting him.

308
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,110
Oh, Usoland and Robiland,
have you eaten enough?

309
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,740
Yeah, I'm totally pigged out...

310
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,120
I mean, I had enough and I'm ready to go!

311
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:52,060
Look, my body trembles with excitement
so the ground is shaking!

312
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,130
--How awesome!
--He's unbelievable!

313
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,530
By the way, Leo,
you people keep saying "fight" but...

314
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,050
...why do you wanna fight Doflamingo?

315
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,070
What?

316
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,270
The hero's very funny!

317
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,460
We want to rescue the 500
friends who are forced

318
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,490
to work at the shady factory, of course!

319
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,380
What?! A factory?!

320
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,960
Is that the one that Luffy and
the others went to destroy?!

321
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,190
Is that the one that's manufacturing SMILEs?

322
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,730
I don't know what they are making there

323
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,150
but they also have the Tontatta Tribe's...

324
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:45,770
...obnoxious, selfish, mean, moody,
short-tempered Princess Mancherie, too.

325
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,820
So we have to get going!

326
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,270
Sounds like she's a horrible person!

327
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,730
Yes but...

328
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,890
...she's one of us, too!

329
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,660
Noland would save everybody
who's in trouble, wouldn't he?

330
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,700
What?!

331
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,740
Y-Yeah, he would! That's
what a true hero does!

332
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,500
Since I'm his descendant,
I'd do the same, of course!

333
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,410
That's our legendary hero!

334
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,140
Leo!

335
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
Flapper!

336
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,880
What's wrong?

337
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,890
Leo, I just heard the Don Quixote
Family at the palace is on the move!

338
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,060
They're probably heading to
the basement of the Colosseum!

339
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,650
Kabu-san's Yellow Cub
and Bian's Pink Bee

340
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,990
are ready to take off anytime!

341
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,310
Okay!

342
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,600
Let's go! Usoland! Robiland!

343
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,980
Is everybody ready now?!

344
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,400
Yeah!

345
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,100
The legendary hero - Usoland is here with us!

346
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,480
He's the strongest ally that we can expect!

347
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,330
This is not a miracle! This must be destiny!

348
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,890
Let's win today's battle
and rescue our friends!

349
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,090
The battle will take place in Dressrosa!

350
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,690
Underneath the Colosseum!

351
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,470
At the shady factory!

352
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,030
Let's go, everybody!

353
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,970
Yeah!
