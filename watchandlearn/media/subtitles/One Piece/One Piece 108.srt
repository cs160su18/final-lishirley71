00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:16,210
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,700
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,430
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,290
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people take up weapons.

25
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,040
A fake King Cobra
appeared before the people

26
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,990
"Nanohana"

27
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,120
and claimed to be responsible
for the lack of rain.

28
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,380
Moreover, he destroyed the city
and persecuted its people.

29
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,270
Unaware it was all a trap set by Crocodile,

30
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,250
the people's hatred exploded.

31
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,640
The intense flames of rebellion
covered all of Alabasta.

32
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,300
Ready for the final showdown,
the rebel army heads

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,950
to the capital city of Alubarna.

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,860
However, Luffy and company still
remain in a Rainbase prison cell.

35
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,810
"The Terrifying Bananagators and Mr. Prince"

36
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,590
The rebel army is quickly approaching!

37
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,460
Listen! We must protect
Alabasta by our own hands!

38
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,970
Do not fear sacrifice!

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,900
Fight to the utmost of your power!

40
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,230
Counter the rebel army!

41
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,610
Take up intercept positions!

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,440
Bring Alubarna down!

43
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,240
Are you okay, Koza?

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,010
This is nothing!

45
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,510
At this pace, we'll reach
Alubarna by morning!

46
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,600
Let's continue our march at this speed!

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,440
Right!

48
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,180
The decisive battle will be at dawn!

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,450
What a coincidence.

50
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,010
We're just about to head to Alubarna, too.

51
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,040
If you'd like to come with us, then do so.

52
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,480
Or...

53
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,570
...would you rather save these people?

54
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,990
That's--!

55
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,680
The key to this cell?! Give it here!

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,700
A hole?!

57
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,920
It won't be too long before
their fight to the death begins.

58
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,870
Even if you hurried to Alubarna from here,

59
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,890
who knows if you'd make it in time...?

60
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,010
To stop the rebellion, you'd need
to leave at once, Miss Wednesday.

61
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,360
Or will you save these people instead?

62
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,070
Though it doesn't help that I accidentally
dropped the key below the floor,

63
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,510
into the bananagators' den.

64
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,070
A bananagator!

65
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,120
Bananagator?

66
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,330
Whoa! What's that?! There's an
alligator growing from that banana!

67
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,130
W-What is that insanely huge alligator?!

68
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,030
This room is underwater?!

69
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,500
What a weird banana!

70
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,440
You idiot! Look closer!

71
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,550
It's an alligator with a
banana growing out of it!

72
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,060
It's a weird gator!

73
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,520
Hey! What happened, Vivi?!

74
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,550
A bananagator swallowed
the key to your cell!

75
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,060
What?! Chase it and make it spit it out!

76
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,830
I can't!

77
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,990
Bananagators are so ferocious
that they even prey on Sea Kings!

78
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,350
Get near one, and you'll
be eaten in one bite!

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,350
I apologize for clumsily dropping the key.

80
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,220
Plus, there's no telling
which one swallowed it.

81
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,140
What?!

82
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,210
I can't believe this guy!

83
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,980
Damn! If we could just get out of here,
I could handle those reptiles!

84
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,410
You're so dumb, Zoro!

85
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,000
We can't get out
because the key got eaten!

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,930
I know that!

87
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,490
Well, then.

88
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,860
We must be going a little earlier than you.

89
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,060
Also, this room will be destroyed
automatically in one hour's time.

90
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,770
This secret underground room I've
used as Baroque Works president

91
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,010
is no longer of use.

92
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,530
It will soon fill with water and
be submerged in Rainbase's lake.

93
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,230
One million innocent citizens,
or a mere four pirates with no future?

94
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,550
Only one choice can be saved,
though the odds are low for both.

95
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,370
Your feelings are your ante,
Miss Wednesday.

96
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,480
Do you like gambling?

97
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,790
With so many fools in this country,
this was such an easy job.

98
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,340
The juvenile rebels and the old man
digging in Yuba, for example.

99
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,660
W-What?! You mean the dry old guy?!

100
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,380
A foolish old man who keeps
pecking away every day

101
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,280
at an oasis that's long dead.

102
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,940
He keeps at it,
despite the constant sandstorms.

103
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,480
Why, you--!

104
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,520
Tell me, Straw Hat Luffy.

105
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,120
Do you think sandstorms can strike
towns perfectly time after time?

106
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,950
What are you saying?

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,830
Yuba, you see...

108
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,960
...can't be beaten by
some lousy sandstorms!

109
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,180
I'll dig it back up as
many times as it takes!

110
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,480
As many times as it takes!

111
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,370
As many times as it takes...

112
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,830
You did it?!

113
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,030
Vivi-chan.

114
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,940
I have faith in His Majesty!

115
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,040
He's not someone who would
ever betray the kingdom.

116
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,500
I-I'll kill you!

117
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,720
Water's leaking in!

118
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,190
The whole room's gonna be
flooded if we don't do something!

119
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,890
Vivi! Help! Do something!

120
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,150
I don't want only one hour to live!

121
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,660
Quit freaking out.

122
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,790
Are you crazy, Zoro?!

123
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,730
How can I not freak out at time like this?!

124
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,400
We're gonna die if we don't do something!

125
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,480
Don't you understand?!

126
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,910
The kingdom or my friends, you say?!

127
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,370
I doubt you really plan
on giving anything back!

128
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,800
You plan to take my life too
before I reach Alubarna!

129
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,580
I know full well that nothing
will end unless I beat you!

130
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,580
You don't even know anything

131
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,960
about this country's people,
history, way of life...

132
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,430
You don't know anything about it!

133
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,390
Vivi!

134
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,120
Do something! Get us out of here!

135
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,870
Luffy-san...

136
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,620
Finally starting to beg for
your life, Straw Hat Luffy?

137
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,880
But it's only natural.

138
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,100
Everyone is afraid of dying.

139
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,580
If we...

140
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,850
If we die, then who's
going to kick your ass?!

141
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,320
Don't flatter yourself, small fry.

142
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,770
You're the small fry!

143
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,740
Well, this is your chance to
abandon them, Miss Wednesday.

144
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,340
If you wish to stop the rebellion, that is.

145
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,170
It's so big!

146
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,480
Alright! Beat it, Vivi!

147
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,870
That's crazy talk! It's too huge!

148
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,090
Vivi! Run! You can't beat it!

149
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,720
But help us!

150
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,480
You're the one who's talking crazy!

151
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,530
Wait! Look out the windows!

152
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,590
They're all waiting for their turn!

153
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,290
We're pretty much being treated as food!

154
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,110
We're all gonna be in their
stomachs in an hour?!

155
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,900
Peacock Str--!

156
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,930
I-It's fast!

157
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,220
It took a chomp out of the
stone stairs in one instant!

158
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,660
What a jaw!

159
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,250
Vivi!

160
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,380
Damn! These monsters are unstoppable!

161
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,340
Oww...

162
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,110
Vivi! Run!

163
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,100
Get up!

164
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,770
Vivi! It's gonna eat you!

165
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,190
Someone's calling.

166
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,600
What?

167
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,280
Hello? Hello?

168
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,750
Can you hear me?

169
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,100
Yes, I hear you. You're a Millions, yes?

170
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,230
Hey, does this thing work?

171
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,820
I've never used a
Mini-Transponder Snail before.

172
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,890
Yes, everything is fine.
You can talk just as you are.

173
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,970
What do you want?

174
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,100
Hurry and state your business!
What happened?!

175
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,240
Oh, I've heard that voice before.

176
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,020
Heya. You've called
the Damn Restaurant.

177
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,820
Heya. You've called
the Damn Restaurant.

178
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,450
The Damn Restaurant?

179
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,850
Oh, it sounds like you remember me.

180
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,720
That's great.

181
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,370
Heya. You've called
the Damn Restaurant.

182
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,760
You want reservations?

183
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,230
Quit fooling around, dumbass.

184
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,140
Transponder Snail?!
What are you talking about?

185
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,310
I never used a Transponder Snail
while on Little Garden!

186
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,280
I'm certain we have all four
Straw Hat pirates inside that cell.

187
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,640
All that's left is their pet.

188
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,390
Does this mean there are still others?

189
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,020
Hey, did you hear that?

190
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,580
"Damn Restaurant"? Could it be?!

191
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,340
San--!

192
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,440
Wait, Luffy!

193
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,740
The enemy doesn't know about him!

194
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,640
He was in his room when Mr. 2
showed up, so they never met!

195
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,570
Sanji-san...

196
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,840
That's right! Sanji-san and
Tony-kun are still outside!

197
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,140
Just who are you?

198
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,090
Me? I'm...

199
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,060
...Mr. Prince.

200
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,580
I see. Mr. Prince.

201
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,330
Where are you?

202
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,600
'Fraid I can't say!

203
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,730
If I did, you'd come get rid of me.

204
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,700
Though, setting aside whether
or not you can get rid of me,

205
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,420
I'm not so stupid as to give
up information so easily.

206
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,230
Unlike you, Mr. 0.

207
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,080
Prince! Help!

208
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,420
We've been caught! There's no time!

209
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,380
--Come rescue me!
--Mr. Prince! Help me!

210
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,130
Sounds like my crew's right by your side.

211
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,570
In that case, I'm gonna--

212
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,610
Troublesome bastard!

213
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,940
Hello?

214
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,690
We've caught him!

215
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,350
What should we do
with this strange man?!

216
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,030
Sanji-san... No...

217
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,230
Where are you? Tell me!

218
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,500
T-The front gate of a casino
in Rainbase named Raindinners!

219
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,460
That useless moron!

220
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,670
That bastard better be alive!

221
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,230
Sanji!

222
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,760
Our hope...

223
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,500
This is great.

224
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,830
Let's go to the front gate.

225
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,940
Is that wise? The Millions still
don't know who their boss is.

226
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,410
I won't be going as their boss.

227
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,300
Aside from the Number Agents,
no one knows who you and I are.

228
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,850
What's so strange about Crocodile,
the owner of this casino,

229
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,000
going to see what has happened
in front of his building?

230
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,370
Vivi!

231
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,550
What are you doing, Vivi?!

232
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,140
There's still time before
this room fills up with water!

233
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,060
I'm going outside to get help!

234
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,510
Yeah! There's no way he
kicked the bucket just now!

235
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,560
If Vivi can just free him--!

236
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,060
And Chopper's outside, too!
We might have a chance!

237
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,850
Look out, Vivi!

238
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,240
Vivi!

239
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Enough of your nonsense!

240
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,500
--Vivi! Wake up! Vivi!
--The gator's coming! Vivi!

241
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,670
If you love your friends that much,
you can all die here together.

242
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,520
The water will soon turn this
into their feeding ground

243
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,730
and submerge the entire room.

244
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,460
I'll drag your cheeky Mr. Prince
here too, if you'd like!

245
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,190
Hopefully you don't mind corpses!

246
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,490
Damn it!

247
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,500
Oh! Owner Crocodile!

248
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,030
Have you heard what
happened in Nanohana?!

249
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,980
Yes, I have.

250
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,980
The whole town-- no, the whole country--
is clamoring at the news

251
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,280
that the rebel army and the royal
army are finally about to clash!

252
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,820
I'm not surprised.

253
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,190
The king does let pirates
attack cities freely.

254
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,190
I always thought something
like this might happen.

255
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,370
Hey, look! It's Crocodile-san!

256
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,300
It really is him! He's so wonderful!

257
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,650
He rarely shows himself inside the casino!

258
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,850
Crocodile-sama!

259
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,910
You're as popular as ever.

260
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,650
Quit it with the gloomy look!

261
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,340
Curse you. When did you touch my face?

262
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,100
I didn't touch it! I punched it!

263
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,970
Have you forgotten, Musclebrain?!

264
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,000
What?!

265
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,980
Oh? You wanna fight?

266
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,270
Knock it off! Aren't there
others for you to fight?

267
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,660
You're no fun!

268
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,240
Why do I have to work
with someone so un-fun?

269
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,280
Fun or not, Alubarna has
finally come into view.

270
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,200
Oh? Let me see, let me see!
Oh, there it is!

271
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,920
So that's Alubarna,
where the drama will unfold?

272
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,660
Where Zero-chan's ambition
will blossom as a desert flower?!

273
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,250
Vivi!

274
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,010
T-They've always been there
to help me all this time...

275
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,720
I refuse to just let them die...

276
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,820
Yes! She got away!

277
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,470
The water's broken through the glass!

278
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,370
Now we got less than 20 minutes
until this room's submerged!

279
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,940
Vivi! You alright?!

280
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,810
Everyone! Hang in there a little longer!

281
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,260
I will bring back help!
I promise I won't abandon you!

282
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,020
Yeah! We're counting on you, Vivi!

283
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,110
What in the world is this?

284
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,790
Including the employees just
done in by Pell the Falcon,

285
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,330
it looks like all the Millions
in this town have been wiped out.

286
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,520
What happened?! Hey!

287
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,090
A-A man named Mr. Prince...

288
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,470
I thought you caught him?

289
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,040
Where did he go?!

290
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,480
He just now headed to
the south part of town...

291
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,250
Just now?

292
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,140
Him?!

293
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,180
Small fry.

294
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,890
Don't think you can escape me.

295
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,030
Why not forget about him?

296
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,050
Quiet.

297
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:01,740
I've always killed everyone
who's made a mockery of me!

298
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,570
Whoa! An earthquake?!

299
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,070
This is bad!

300
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,480
The bridge into
Raindinners has collapsed!

301
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,760
Just out of the blue?!

302
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,550
What's going on?! What caused it?!

303
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,630
Hey! What's going on?!

304
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,590
Now we can't get back to town!

305
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,600
Aren't there any boats?!

306
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,850
What's going on?!

307
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,180
The bridge fell!

308
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,610
Oh no! I can't go outside now?!

309
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,720
It's not about not going outside.

310
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,420
It's about keeping Baroque Works
from coming back in.

311
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,440
It's all part of the plan.

312
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,690
Chopper's running around
town as a decoy as we speak.

313
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,160
We gotta hurry.

314
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,060
The rebellion's begun, too.

315
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,560
Sanji-san!

316
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,840
Think you could tell me
where they are, Princess?

317
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,770
I always wanted to talk about it

318
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:31,580
I couldn't even say half of it

319
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

320
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:55,480
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

321
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,690
Glory glory you're my shine

322
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:06,450
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

323
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:12,200
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

324
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm sure I'll make it there

325
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,530
Whoa! There's a whole bunch now!

326
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,220
We're gonna die!

327
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,590
I'm suddenly out of strength...

328
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,390
Hey, now! Endure it!

329
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,160
Damn!

330
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,070
If only I were a better swordsman,
this cage'd be nothing!

331
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,140
Heya! Been waiting long?

332
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,430
Oh! Prince!

333
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,260
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,100
"The Key to a Great Comeback Escape!
The Wax-Wax Ball!"

335
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,220
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
