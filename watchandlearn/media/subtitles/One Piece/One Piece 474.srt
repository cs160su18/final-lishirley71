2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's go

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
I'll keep getting back up

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
To the future I believe in...

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,350
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,590
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,690
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,610
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,660
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,520
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,460
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,210
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,420
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

63
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,280
Luffy and the others are fighting
hard to get to the scaffold

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,670
but the Navy has activated encircling
walls leaving the pirates no way out!

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,430
Hey, what's wrong?!
It should be fully activated!

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,140
I-I'm afraid that the wall
can't lift the giant body of Oars!

67
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,230
It seems like his blood is
running down in the system

68
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,970
and making it less powerful!

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,390
Oars! Y-You're...

70
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,230
We can't close it but...

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,740
...do it, Akainu!

72
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,210
"Execution Order Issued!
Break Through the Encircling Walls!"

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,330
Why did it black out?!

74
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,780
Let us see the war!

75
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,100
Hurry and fix it!

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,560
They're having trouble with
the Video Transponder Snail!

77
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,150
There's nothing we can do!

78
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,470
Is it true that the Navy and
Whitebeard had a secret deal?!

79
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,950
Do something!

80
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,870
Did Whitebeard sell out his allies?!

81
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,250
What's gonna happen to the war?!

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,040
What's gonna happen to the world?!

83
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,170
How ridiculous the Navy is!

84
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,860
This means it was just a
sideshow up until now?

85
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,560
We came back just to see the war!

86
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,540
I can't believe there's
trouble with the snail!

87
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,440
So you're buying into that?

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,900
You aren't?

89
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,280
You guys are such fools!

90
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,870
They're not showing it
because there're things...

91
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,830
...that they don't want us
or the world to see.

92
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,610
Captain Bonney...

93
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,100
Shut up! Just leave me alone!

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,130
"Whitebeard sold out his allies?"

95
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,440
That's crap!

96
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,220
He wouldn't do that.
That's why he's a living legend!

97
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,280
Let's set sail, Bepo!

98
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,870
Aye-aye, Captain!

99
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,380
Come with us, Jean Bart!

100
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,120
That's right, Head Office! And there's
no chance of recovering the signal!

101
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,610
So I don't know what's
going on at Marineford now!

102
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,210
Meteor Volcano!

103
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,700
They can't get away!

104
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,300
Melt the ice that they're standing on!

105
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,350
The ice is melting!

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,450
Th-This water is...

107
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,190
Ouch, it's hot!

108
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,320
The seawater's boiling because of the lava!

109
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,510
Get on the ice!

110
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,870
Hey, look!

111
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,810
They're blocking this side!

112
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,370
Can't we break this wall?!

113
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,160
Whitebeard!

114
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,750
Pops' blow didn't work!
It's no ordinary wall!

115
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,260
Alright, let's finish this up!

116
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,160
The lava hit the back of the Moby Dick!

117
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
Put out the fire!

118
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,520
Hurry up, everybody!

119
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,860
Do whatever it takes!

120
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,230
Don't let it sink!

121
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,090
We were looking forward to sailing
the world with Ace again on that ship!

122
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,980
Whitebeard! Your days are over!

123
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,310
The Moby Dick is...

124
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,130
Damn the Navy!

125
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,820
The ship of our glory!

126
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,920
Damn! Our ship!

127
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,150
They sank the ship that
carried the Whitebeards for years!

128
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,240
I'm sorry...

129
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,780
We're running out of ways
to get to the plaza!

130
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,060
What's going on inside the walls?!

131
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,110
You know it even if you can't see it!

132
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,840
They can't advance or back up
and keep being pounded.

133
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,080
The encircling walls are none other than
the casket of the Whitebeard Pirates!

134
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,270
The casket...

135
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,230
The plan is going well!

136
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,840
Now let's move on to...

137
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,970
...the execution of Portgaz D. Ace...

138
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,380
...immediately!

139
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,160
At a place we can't even see...

140
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,450
...We won't let them kill Ace!

141
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,800
Yes! There is still a way!

142
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,580
Just one!

143
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,420
The way that Oars made!

144
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,600
We'll be sitting ducks if we go that way!

145
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,830
The Navy is expecting
us to go there for sure!

146
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,400
There's no time to argue!

147
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,230
He's right! That's the
only way to save Ace...

148
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,130
Ace!

149
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,670
Straw Hat...

150
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,600
We're coming too!

151
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,400
They shouldn't take such an obvious route!

152
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,910
Not yet! Let them approach
as close as possible!

153
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,040
Fire!

154
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,070
Of course they're going to
defend the only way out!

155
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,240
It's more like a trap!

156
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,250
Fire!

157
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,230
Ace!

158
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,090
We're finishing them off little by little!

159
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,470
Ace!

160
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,730
Ace...

161
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,280
Ace...

162
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,650
Ace!!

163
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,860
Fire!

164
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,140
Straw boy!

165
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,090
Luffy-kun!

166
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,960
Luffy!!

167
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,420
Shoot everyone who came over Oars!

168
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,460
I'm gonna save you even if it means my death!

169
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,290
Proceed with the execution.

170
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,140
Ace-... kun!

171
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,600
Little Oars Jr.! He's still alive?!

172
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,360
Ace-kun!

173
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,990
Ace-kun!

174
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,910
Ace-kun!

175
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,430
Oars...!

176
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,200
I protect Ace-kun!

177
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,080
Oars!!

178
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,720
Oars!

179
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,810
Oars is alive!

180
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
Captain!

181
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
What guy!

182
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,440
Oars...

183
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,650
Captain Squard!

184
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,880
Captain... Squard!

185
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,340
You all...

186
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,390
Alright!

187
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,000
Are you okay, Luffy-kun?!

188
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,720
Honestly! You're too reckless!

189
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,680
Get ready to shoot!

190
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,810
Fire!

191
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,120
Oars!

192
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,290
They'll beat Oars again!

193
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,120
Oars!

194
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,840
Oars!

195
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,240
We gotta do something! We gotta hurry!

196
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,500
They'll execute Ace!

197
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,930
Yes, we have to stop them!

198
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,760
Jimbei!

199
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,760
I need you to do me a favor!

200
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,350
Ace-kun!

201
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,060
How tough!

202
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,410
He's barely alive! Keep shooting!

203
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh, okay. Let me do it!

204
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,170
Kizaru-san!

205
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,620
We have to finish the execution already!

206
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,970
I better take out his
head at a time like this!

207
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Oars!

208
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,830
Captain Oars!

209
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,540
Oars!!

210
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,460
It's over!

211
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,810
Ocean Current Shoulder Throw!

212
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Lu...!

213
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,100
Luffy!!

214
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,430
Oh no! You finally made it!

215
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,440
You're standing tall, Dragon's son!

216
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,230
It scares me! His youthfulness!

217
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,920
The guy who jumped over
the wall was Ace's brother!

218
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,120
That brat!

219
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,140
I praise you just for your tenacity.

220
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,010
But you're not good enough
to reach this stage yet.

221
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,190
What makes you think that you can beat us?

222
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:27,950
I'm gonna get Ace back!!

223
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,210
He's so reckless just like his brother!

224
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,880
Oars, stay there!

225
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,150
I need your power!

226
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,120
Pops!

227
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,810
Jozu, the trump card!

228
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,590
Okay!

229
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,480
Everyone, get ready!

230
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,220
We're gonna charge into the plaza!

231
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,320
Gum-Gum...

232
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,020
...Stamp Gatling!

233
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,850
Luffy finally leads the
charge into the plaza.

234
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,890
But the three admirals form
a heavy wall in front of him,

235
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,770
repelling his advance.

236
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,540
Meanwhile, in the bay, Whitebeard
prepares to deal his final trump card

237
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,910
to change the course of the battle!

238
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

239
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,200
"Moving into the Final Phase!
Whitebeard's Trump Card for Recovery!"

240
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
