00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,980
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,760
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,270
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,370
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,380
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,810
It really took a long time.

35
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,800
But I'm finally here.

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,770
Once I've gone through those gates,
I can be the Government's...

37
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,480
No, the world's hero!

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,360
Lucci, huh? So you're having
a tough time against him?

39
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,320
Where's Nico Robin? I brought two keys.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,950
Shall I give you a hand?

41
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,820
No. More importantly...

42
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,770
...please stop Robin.

43
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,890
You can get to the Gates of Justice
through the doors behind the pigeon guy.

44
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,920
Robin has already been taken away.

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,970
I'll restrain him.

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,590
Just super leave it to me, you jerk!

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Thanks for waiting!

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,570
Arms, legs, and neck...
If I can control their reach at will,

49
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,440
I can swing my swords vigorously!

50
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,250
I'm a Four-Sword Style swordsman.

51
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,120
I can now make full use of the giraffe's power!

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,580
You no longer have any chance against me!

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,000
The giraffe's power is very strong...

54
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,090
You can store your obstructive neck away...

55
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,720
You use the Four-Sword Style...

56
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,220
Hmph!

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,270
What?!

58
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,230
He stopped my sword attacks?!

59
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,950
None of those things...
can be a basis for my defeat.

60
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,700
"Demon God Zoro! An Incarnation
of Asura Born from Fighting Spirit"

61
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,690
What a useless retort.
Then show me your "basis"!

62
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,830
Three-Sword Style...

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,190
...Leopard...

64
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,240
...Spinning...

65
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,200
He's gonna fly towards me!

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,570
...Shot!

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,310
Paper Art!

68
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,300
Can't be...! I'm sure I saw through his attack!

69
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,930
Don't tell me...

70
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,960
Did he actually foresee my reaction?!

71
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,900
What are you so surprised about?

72
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,820
Don't tell me you've never been cut before...

73
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,600
Hmph! I see... So it looks like
it wasn't just an empty boast.

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,590
I underestimated you a bit. But no longer.

75
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,310
I've mastered the Six Powers. On top of that,
I now have the wild powers of a giraffe.

76
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,540
Techniques, power, speed...
There's no way you can beat me in any of them!

77
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,420
I won't give you any more openings to attack!

78
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,090
Tempest Kick Throwing Stars!

79
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,230
Giraffe Blast!

80
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,980
Shoot!

81
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,840
My neck can become a whip...

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,150
Whiplash!

83
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,700
And now for the faster version...
Fierce Whiplash!

84
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,210
How's this?! Can you still talk big?!

85
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,510
The four-sword attacks
will not stop. Just give it up!

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,800
Fury Slash!

87
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,140
Here I come...!

88
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,890
What a vigorous attack!

89
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,610
Well, well! What's the matter?!
All you can do now is block!

90
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,150
You can't defeat me!

91
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,740
You guys are mere pirates.

92
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,620
It was a mistake to go up against the
World Government in the first place!

93
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,960
Now that it's come to this, in the
name of justice, you'll have to die...

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,420
...just like that woman!

95
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,480
You bastard...

96
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,810
What was that?!

97
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,790
For a moment, he looked like a demon
god with three faces and six arms!

98
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,710
What the hell is with this guy?!

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,990
You're getting carried away.

100
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,130
You talk too much.

101
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,380
You're tired of listening to me?

102
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,700
Then I'll use my strongest
Tempest Kick, Sky Slicer,

103
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,360
the one that slashed this tower...

104
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,860
...and end this battle by splitting you into two!

105
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,280
So give it up. You have nowhere to escape.

106
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,490
It's on a completely different level from
the demonstration I showed you earlier!

107
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,200
You fool...

108
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,170
You're the one who has to give up.

109
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,080
Demon Aura... Nine-Sword Style...

110
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,100
...Asura!

111
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,730
The demon god I saw earlier...!

112
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,480
He can show such a powerful
illusion with his fighting spirit?!

113
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,440
Splendid! But it's too late!

114
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,570
You're the one who's too late.

115
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,390
Wait until you dodge this
Tempest Kick to make such a boast.

116
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,060
Sky Slicer!

117
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,270
My slash attack...

118
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,820
...was turned into mist?!

119
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,030
Hardships are fine by me!

120
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,780
I choose to walk the path of Asura!

121
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,710
Asura... Silver Mist!

122
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,800
I've got...

123
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,430
...a message for you from
the junior boss of Galley-La.

124
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,020
When you see... those guys, tell them...

125
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,860
He said you guys're fired.

126
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,970
I considered you guys my friends all this time!

127
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,110
Paulie, huh?

128
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,440
I see... I'm in trouble.

129
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,900
Assassination skills aren't very
helpful in other lines of work.

130
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,740
You can still work in a zoo.

131
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,620
Hey, be nice...

132
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,290
Sorry.

133
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,010
Hm?

134
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,430
Hey, Moss Head! Where's the key?!

135
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,590
Yeah...

136
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,020
I just got it.

137
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,550
I see.

138
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,550
At any rate, looks like you
guys really put on a show.

139
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,000
Didn't you guys cause the tower
to slip even more? Is it okay?

140
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,560
Who cares? That's not important.

141
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,900
Anyway, we now have all the keys.

142
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,410
Yeah.

143
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,040
Let's hurry to Robin.

144
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,500
Run!

145
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,510
Just run! Keep running at full speed!

146
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,950
It's our duty to survive so that we won't
worry our Bro and the Straw Hats!

147
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,680
Ribbit!

148
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,830
Run in order to live! Even if it breaks your legs!

149
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,060
Yeah!

150
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,570
Run!

151
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,980
We're counting on you, giants!

152
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,680
You guys... If you guys are just gonna
ride on there, then at least be quiet!

153
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,450
Yeah, I agree!

154
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Go! In the name of Elbaf!

155
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,460
Shut up!

156
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,690
Grandma! Hurry! Hurry up! Hurry up!

157
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,010
Hey, Chimney! I'm old! Show a little kindness!

158
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,470
Seriously, I can't keep running
unless I refuel myself.

159
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,050
Whoa!

160
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,690
Grandma! He's gonna fall off!
Pull him up! Pull him up!

161
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,760
Boy, you sure are demanding, geez...!

162
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,130
Grandma!

163
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,060
"Hurry up," right? I know!

164
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,780
The bridge is finally completely connected!

165
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,590
I can't stop laughing!

166
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,170
Hey! Guards at the Gates of Justice!
Are you guys ready?!

167
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,510
Yes, sir! The escort ship is already
in front of the third column and...

168
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,300
That's not it! Why aren't you
coming out to salute me?!

169
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,500
Great Spandam the hero is passing through!

170
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,930
Ah! Y-Yes! We'll be right out!

171
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,000
Geez, those idiots! They can't
do anything on their own!

172
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,470
Hey, Nico Robin. Look at that.

173
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,140
That small gate is the actual entrance.

174
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,940
When you pass through it, you'll cross
the border between heaven and hell.

175
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,900
And that's the moment my name
will be engraved in history!

176
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,590
Oops. Where're you trying to run away to now?

177
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,110
I'm actually sympathizing with you, at least.

178
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,320
But it can't be helped, right?
Your life has no value.

179
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,470
Hurry up and die.

180
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,290
That bitch!

181
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,050
I don't wanna die...

182
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,010
I don't wanna die...!

183
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,970
I don't wanna die!

184
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,900
I've had enough, you bitch!

185
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,030
Stand up already and...

186
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,660
What? She isn't moving. What's going on?!

187
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,410
She's biting into the stone bridge!

188
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,050
She just doesn't know when
to give up! How irritating!

189
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,270
It's detestable how she clings to life!

190
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,150
It's pitiful and vulgar!

191
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,900
You're a criminal! The only way you
can make others happy is by dying!

192
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,250
Why must you act so miserable
until the very last minute?!

193
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,440
I fear death so much...

194
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,810
I don't wanna die...!

195
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,400
Help me, everyone...

196
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,810
Luffy...!

197
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,540
Finger Pistol!

198
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,710
I told you that doesn't work...!

199
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,000
Yellow Lotus!

200
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,880
Straw Hat!

201
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,550
No...

202
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,100
My mission is to go past those
doors as soon as possible!

203
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,170
It's no use. You can't pass through here.

204
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,050
Shut up! Strong...

205
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,570
--Iron Body.
--...Hammer!

206
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,560
What? He doesn't budge an inch...

207
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,960
...when it was strong enough
to blow Chapapa away.

208
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,820
I see. You came after defeating Fukurou, huh?

209
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,500
But sorry. My Power Level
is five times as strong as his.

210
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,080
It's splendid that you
were able to defeat Fukurou.

211
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,400
It can be said that you're already
in the boundary of superhumans.

212
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,910
As I suspected, he's incomparably
stronger than the others.

213
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,530
But... die.

214
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,910
Gum-Gum...

215
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,620
...Jet Pistol!

216
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,050
What the hell did you...

217
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,730
What's that steam?!

218
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,230
Second Gear.

219
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,910
This can't last too long.

220
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,960
But I'll stop him, so you go on ahead, Franky!

221
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,120
Robin's waiting!

222
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,590
Okay, Straw Hat!

223
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,890
I don't know what's going on,
but finish him off with that!

224
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,880
I said I wouldn't let you do that...

225
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,520
...didn't I?

226
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,730
Whoa! So you are a power holder, too?!

227
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,770
First, I'll kill you, Franky.

228
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,530
Jet Whip!

229
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,900
Did you forget, Straw Hat Luffy?

230
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,670
You went down with a single
thrust I gave you in this form.

231
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,880
Oh, that... I got better after I ate meat.

232
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,470
Shave!

233
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,510
Finger Pistol!

234
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,350
Gum-Gum...

235
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,180
Iron Body!

236
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,390
...Jet Bazooka!

237
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,980
Franky!

238
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,440
Please save Robin!

239
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,980
Just super leave it to me!

240
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,810
You bitch! You still don't get it?!
I said this is useless!

241
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,380
How many times do I have to tell you?!

242
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,220
There's no hope left for you!

243
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,370
I'm not going anywhere!

244
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,100
They'll all come to rescue me for sure!

245
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,590
Listen good, marines. Just watch carefully!

246
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,260
This is the great first step of the hero Spandam

247
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,220
who will be engraved in histo...

248
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,190
What?! Who's that?!

249
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

250
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,820
"Spandam Frightened!
The Hero on the Tower of Law"

251
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,050
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
