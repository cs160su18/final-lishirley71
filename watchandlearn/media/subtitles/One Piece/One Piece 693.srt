All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

71
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

72
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

73
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

76
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

77
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

78
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,750
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

80
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,840
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,070
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

82
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,740
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

83
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,010
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

84
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,700
On top of that, he put prices
on the heads of Luffy and

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,320
11 others, and now they're being
hunted by all the citizens.

86
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,130
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

87
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,210
Luffy and Law are heading
to the Royal Palace!

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,580
"The Little People's Princess!
Captive Mansherry!"

89
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,920
Well done. Guys!

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,970
It's a robot!

91
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,140
A robot came to save us!

92
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,550
Thank you!

93
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,200
--A robot!
--Cool!

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Is everybody okay?!

95
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,690
How are you?!

96
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,030
We all came to save you!

97
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,070
To save... us?

98
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,040
I-I'm so happy for all of you!

99
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,000
--Thank you, Robot-san!
--His name is not Robot!

100
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,510
He's our savior, a Big Human - Fraland!

101
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,670
A Big Human?!

102
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,530
Princess Mansherry!
Is she alright?!

103
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,180
As for Princess Mansherry,
Mouji is...

104
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,120
...looking now...

105
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,680
S... S... S...

106
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,670
She's not here.

107
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,420
Princess Mansherry is...

108
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,570
...nowhere to be found! No way!

109
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,450
Princess? Princess? Princess?
Where are you?!

110
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,030
Not here!

111
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,180
Not here!

112
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,520
The princess isn't here!

113
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,580
We've been fooled! I can't believe it!

114
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,060
Stop!

115
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,720
Princess, please be safe!
I, Mouji, am coming to save you!

116
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,970
Princess!

117
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,470
Wait, Mouji!

118
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,180
Princess!

119
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,060
Where are you?!

120
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,980
Not here! Not here!

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,260
Princess? Princess? Princess!!

122
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,150
Prin...

123
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,220

124
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,210
What?

125
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,380
Princess!

126
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,410
--Mouji, wait!
--Where are you?!

127
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,410
Princess!

128
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,770
Oh? I hear a strange noise.

129
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,800
Oh, just rats!

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,900
I gotta find her! Princess!

131
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,780
Wait!

132
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,860
We all looked... but Princess Mansherry may not be here!

133
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,280
What?!

134
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,160
You can't find Princess Mansherry?!

135
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,060
What kind of person is Princess Mansherry?

136
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,700
Princess Mansherry is...

137
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,570
You fools!

138
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,870
How dare you pay no notice to me
for such a long time!

139
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,330
Is she the princess?

140
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,610
No way!

141
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,000
The factory...

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,840
...is...

143
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,800
...my life!

144
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,760
I'm the factory manager.
I'm the most powerful figure in this factory!

145
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,980
You're Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hats,
aren't you?

146
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,390
You're a One-star criminal.
How did you make it this far alive?

147
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,290
What did you do to Pink-sama?

148
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,860
That fool?

149
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:07,400
A FEW MINUTES AGO

150
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,700
I saw a weak old granny

151
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,600
having trouble in the back street

152
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,060
on the right!

153
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,130
I just remembered I have

154
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,130
some minor business to attend to.

155
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,900
I guess it's tough to live a hard-boiled life.

156
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,550
What're you talking about?

157
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,850
There's no old granny!

158
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,180
Anyway, I won't let you do as you like in this factory!

159
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,810
I'm gonna take your life!

160
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,230
Watch out! Run, Fraland!

161
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,450
Fraland hugged the factory manager!

162
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,310
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE
LEVEL 3

163
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,970
--We're totally surrounded.
--Aren't they increasing?

164
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,220
Destroying them all is
the only way to advance, it seems.

165
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,300
Alright!

166
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,180
Kick all their asses, you mean?

167
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,410
--Yes.
--That's right.

168
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,570
Gum-Gum Gatling!

169
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,980
Oh? My leg is stuck!

170
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,170
Whoa! Thank you! You saved me.

171
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,300
Kid, you give me a lot of trouble.

172
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,540
It's coming.

173
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,890
--They're coming one after another!
--We can't spend too much time here!

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,980
I'll take care of them all at once!

175
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,150
--I will!
--No, me!

176
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,840
First come, first served, then!

177
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,370
H-Hey, what's going on?!
What are you doing?! Let go of me!

178
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,800
Fraland hugged the manager!

179
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,670
Did Fraland fall in love with her?!

180
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,540
She's Fraland's type?

181
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,220
That cyborg idiot, how dare he fool me!

182
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,930
There's no troubled old granny anywhere.

183
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,060
Well, I'm relieved to know that.

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,020
Oh! So hard-boiled!

185
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,150
Señor Pink!
I'm ready! Bring it on anytime!

186
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,170
Ready?! Bring it on?! You ready for what?!

187
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,150
Cut it out! Are you nuts?!

188
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,610
So manly!

189
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,320
He's so aggressive.

190
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,340
That idiot!

191
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,760
Oh! So cool!

192
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,670
Hey, stop messing with
the morals in the factory!

193
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,380
That bastard has been throwing me around with suplexes!

194
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,770
Was he...

195
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,260
...trying to dig up a hot spring or something
with the back of my head?!

196
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,510
What are you talking about?!

197
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,410
Drop dead!

198
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,640
Cat-Ear Punch!

199
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,670
Franky Southland Suplex!

200
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,380
No! The manager is...

201
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,010
That hurt, you jerk!
How could you use my head like a hammer?!

202
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,950
How dare you treat me so cruelly!

203
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,430
I'm the factory manager!
I'm the most powerful figure here!

204
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,480
Once she gets mad, nobody can stop her!

205
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,270
Please run, Fraland!

206
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,340
Now, what should I do with you?!
I can do anything I want!

207
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,930
I have the power to punish people
in this factory!

208
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,450
You're sentenced to death! Death!
Because you deserve it!

209
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,040
Insulting me is a grave crime!

210
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,960
I'll cut up your body and
suck your guts up with my vacuum

211
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,380
then pound them into pieces!

212
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,030
Why don't you cry like a baby, you...

213
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,940
Fraland kissed the factory manager!

214
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,880
H-He kissed...

215
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,210
This guy just stole a kiss from me...

216
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,260
--Now, get up, you swimming idiot!
--H-Hey!

217
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,960
Wait a minute!
What are you thinking?!

218
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,080
Why did you do that?!

219
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,860
B-Be a man about it
and become my boyfriend!

220
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,650
You fool!

221
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,680
The manager just became a bit
more feminine...

222
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,910
You can't blame him, factory manager.

223
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,860
What?

224
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,700
--You got involved. It's your fault.
--Pink-sama! But...

225
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,360
You cut in to a fight between grown men.
When a woman does that,

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,710
how else can we seal her mouth?

227
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,790
Getting upset over a kiss or two makes you

228
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,680
just an immature little tramp. So don't talk about...

229
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,770
...love or relationships
or that sort of stuff!

230
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,460
That's right.

231
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,270
Love with a little chick like that...

232
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,840
...Would drive me nuts!

233
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,620
So hard-boiled!

234
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,250
Señor! Franky!

235
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,830
How hard-boiled you two are!

236
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
It's getting intense!

237
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,040
Is that what "hard-boiled" is?

238
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,000
I won't let you destroy the factory!

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,920
Humph! Prove it with your fists! If you're a man!

240
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,470
Franky-sama! Pink-sama!

241
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,810
It's gonna start! The men's fight!

242
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,640
Diaper Bombs!

243
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,010
Nipple Light Special!

244
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,740
All right!

245
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,620
I beat up the most!

246
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,580
IN FRONT OF THE PLATEAU -
LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE
THE STATUE OF PICA

247
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,760
You stop that assimilating with the stone crap?

248
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,430
How dare you let Rebecca and
the others get away!

249
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,730
Thank you!
I couldn't have done it without you.

250
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,790
Don't think shitheads like you guys
can escape this country!

251
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,200
He never learns!

252
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,620
Zoro-senpai!

253
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm still so impressed!

254
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,750
Rooster-kun, get yourself together!
We're almost there!

255
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,390
But Zoro-senpai was so cool!

256
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,570
We're almost there at the second level!
Be careful where you land!

257
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,980
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

258
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,880
--Hello, this is Leo.
--It's Mouji!

259
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,840
Mouji! I'm glad to hear from you!

260
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,150
It means our friends have been released!

261
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,860
But Leo, we have a big problem...

262
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,970
What is it?

263
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,780
The princess is...
Princess Mansherry is...

264
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,410
...nowhere to be found in the factory!

265
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,310
What?!

266
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,700
The poor dear...

267
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,380
She must be locked up somewhere
and crying "Mouji! Mouji!"

268
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,640
No...

269
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,510
Get to the old King's Plateau!

270
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,840
Yeah!!

271
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,010
Catch King Riku and God Usopp!

272
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,990
THE OLD KING'S PLATEAU

273
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,230
N-No need to be afraid.
They can't climb up here that easily...

274
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,350
Kill God Usopp!

275
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,980
Father-sama, I just got a call from
the Tontattas in the factory!

276
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,990
Oh, are they alright?!

277
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,940
Yes.

278
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,780
But they told me
they can't find Princess Mansherry anywhere.

279
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,910
What?!

280
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,280
What are you guys talking about?!

281
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,550
Everyone in this country is looking for us!

282
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,750
Let's run now!

283
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,170
Where are you gonna go when
everyone in this country is looking for you?

284
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,210
It'll be fine.

285
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,990
They know the truth about the past.

286
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,090
They're not gonna harm Father-sama.

287
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,080
--What about me?
--Viola.

288
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,010
--Yes.
--Am I being ignored?

289
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,060
If they're hiding Princess Mansherry elsewhere,
it must be in the Palace.

290
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,590
Search there with your ability.

291
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,820
Okay.

292
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,210
Awesome!

293
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,500
You can see inside of the Palace from here?

294
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes, with my Clairvoyance.
I can send my sight wherever I want.

295
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,490
Sanji would kill for your ability.

296
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,770
Princess Mansherry, please be safe.

297
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,300
I wonder what kind of person
Princess Mansherry is.

298
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,100
If I remember correctly, Leo said she's capricious,
selfish, and short-tempered.

299
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,940
Who the hell are you?!

300
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,250
Stop it!

301
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,630
K-Kin'emon!

302
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,320
--Oh, Usopp-dono!
--You know him?

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,110
Yeah, you can let go of him...

304
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,610
There's some kind of weirdo!

305
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,970
He's Kanjuro, who I've been looking for.

306
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,510
Oh, that was you!

307
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,650
Indeed!

308
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,390
I'm a samurai from the Wano Kingdom.

309
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,840
My name is Evening Shower Kanjuro.

310
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,490
What's that pathetic creature...?

311
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,940
Anyway, we surfaced earlier
and were surprised.

312
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,190
Tons of people are heading

313
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,860
towards this plateau
so I wondered what's going on.

314
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,990
That's right!

315
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,820
I think they can't climb up this high but...

316
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,700
Don't worry, long-nosed goblin man!
They were having trouble so...

317
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,410
I made a net for them!

318
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,330
What?

319
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,460
They will be here in any minute.

320
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,530
Why did you do such a thing, you fool?!

321
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,050
Catch God Usopp!

322
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,550
This rope sucks!

323
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,310
--They're coming to get me!
--Was it unnecessary?!

324
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,310
How foolish I've been...

325
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,360
I made a blunder! I failed my savior!

326
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,150
I'll commit hara-kiri to show my regret!

327
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,780
Don't, Kanjuro!

328
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,900
Okay, I won't.

329
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,550
Shut up! Do it!

330
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,360
What are you gonna do about those climbers?!

331
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,320
I don't see her anywhere.

332
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,620
When I was living in the Palace as Violet,

333
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,590
I never heard they'd captured
the Tontattas' Princess Mansherry.

334
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,600
Is she really here?

335
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,700
Father-sama,
I don't see her anywhere.

336
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,950
She must be somewhere.
Search every nook and cranny.

337
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,820
I don't think
Doflamingo has killed Mansherry.

338
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,670
I know he needs her ability.

339
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,450
Though we need that ability
more than him now...

340
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,920
Princess Mansherry, where are you?

341
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,630
There must be a place I haven't looked yet.

342
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,180
A place that I haven't looked
in the last few years.

343
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,880
I had been living here since I was little.

344
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,280
I used to explore all over the Palace.

345
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,910
I snuck into places no one would enter

346
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,700
and I created some mischief
and got scolded by Father-sama and...

347
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,600
Maybe...

348
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,190
I haven't looked at that room!

349
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,770
At the back of the chapel,

350
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,660
there was a room...

351
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,380
Here. Your food.

352
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,900
I want to go back to Green Bit!

353
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,180
Come and save me now!

354
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,790
Leo!

355
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,650
There you are, Mansherry!

356
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,130
Violet finally finds out

357
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,340
Princess Mansherry's whereabouts
with her Clairvoyance

358
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,880
and it gives Leo and the others hope but at that very moment,

359
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,890
Luffy and the others are completely surrounded by

360
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,760
eerie Headcracker Dolls that keep up their

361
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,080
relentless attacks, no matter how many times they get taken down!

362
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,120
On the next episode of One Piece!

363
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,180
"Invincible! A Gruesome Army of Headcracker Dolls!"

364
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,330
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
