2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,450
Luffy and crew managed to avoid
the White Berets' demands,

20
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:15,760
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

21
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,420
but a divine messenger suddenly
dragged Nami and three others away.

22
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,300
So, they're saying that if we
want our friends and ship back,

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,880
we just have to come in from the front.

24
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,720
So that's our ordeal and...

25
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,510
Heaven's Judgment?!

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,850
Yes.

27
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,130
In Upper Yard, four priests strong
beyond imagination await you.

28
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,560
Oh, then it's easy.

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,670
To put it simply, all we have to do
is beat up those priests, right?

30
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,270
You're so simpleminded...

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,190
This is becoming fun!

32
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,780
"A Trap on Lovely Street! The Almighty Eneru"

33
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,380
Hey! Luffy!

34
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,670
W-Wait up!

35
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,650
What is it?

36
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,390
Where are you wandering
off to, all of a sudden?!

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,940
You heard Nami.

38
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,230
We'll only burden Conis and
the old guy if we stay here.

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,360
Yeah, but where are we going?

40
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,290
Isn't it obvious? The sacrificial altar.

41
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,240
How are you plannin' to get there?

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,120
Quit thinking!

43
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,880
We just need to swipe one of those
ships and take the Milky Road.

44
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,090
Do you see any ships we can swipe?!

45
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,170
I said quit thinking!

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,160
This isn't like the Blue Sea, you know!

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,310
This old map doesn't give us details
about Angel Island's geography,

48
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,220
and even how to get onto
the Milky Road is a mystery!

49
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,600
Man, what a pain...

50
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,500
Everyone...

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,350
Conis-chan! Did you come
all this way to see us off?!

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,110
My father asked me to help you on
your way to the sacrificial altar...

53
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,080
Oh? Pagaya-san did?

54
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,500
I'll accompany you to the Angel Island docks.

55
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,060
Once there, I'll prepare an
appropriate boat for you.

56
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,440
Wow! You're too perfect!

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,620
Nothing like a certain scatterbrain I know!

58
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,530
That's for sure!

59
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,820
I was referring to you!

60
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,660
We'd be delighted to have you
accompany us, Conis-chan!

61
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,790
Right, Luffy?!

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,130
Sure, we'll take you up on your offer!

63
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,250
G-Great!

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,150
I won't let you escape!

65
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm going to send you to Upper Yard
to receive Heaven's Judgment!

66
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,780
What's that?!

67
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,850
That's Lovely Street.

68
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,850
Once we're there, we'll be right by the docks.

69
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,640
Aren't they already headed for Upper Yard?

70
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,590
Do we really need to be this secretive?

71
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,530
Fools!

72
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,740
All the Blue Sea people who've
come here have been the same!

73
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,050
At first, they talk all cool
about dreams and adventures,

74
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,460
but once they're in danger, they
suddenly cry and beg for their lives!

75
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,440
I'm so excited to go to Upper Yard!

76
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,530
Y-You could die, you know...

77
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,060
Yeah. Everyone dies sometime.

78
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,290
You're not concerned?

79
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,960
Nope! I'm excited!

80
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,710
Eh?

81
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,210
Quit laughin'!

82
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,030
Worry about Nami-san
and Robin-chan, will ya?!

83
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,100
And the Going Merry and
Zoro and Chopper, too!

84
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,930
S-Sorry...

85
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,690
Wow! This place is great!

86
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,010
Lovely Street is the only
downtown area on Angel Island.

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,620
Check it out! The stores are floating!

88
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,420
They've been built using
the qualities of island cloud.

89
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,580
Wow! Any yakiniku shops?

90
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,140
They're here!

91
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,560
Please, just go straight there...

92
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,680
Just get outta here...!

93
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,740
Is it just me, or is everyone avoiding us?

94
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,140
Can't blame 'em.

95
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,870
Word's probably already
gotten out that we're criminals.

96
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,510
This feels great! All of downtown to ourselves!

97
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,350
All the angels are avoiding me...

98
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,640
Oh? There sure is a lot of weird stuff for sale!

99
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,940
Ooh! If only I had money!

100
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,810
Is a treasure payment plan okay?

101
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,900
No, no!

102
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,550
This must be a dial shop!

103
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,730
I wonder if the Going Merry
could speed along like a waver

104
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,400
if it had two of these big Breath Dials?!

105
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,580
Luffy! This ain't the time to be foolin' around!

106
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,030
Nami-san and the others
are gonna be sacrificed!

107
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,220
Are you even serious about saving 'em?!

108
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,600
Save them? They're gonna be fine!

109
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,160
Zoro was caught with them!

110
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,410
Like we can really count on him!

111
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,350
I just hope the ship isn't any more damaged,

112
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,120
but things've been so crazy lately...

113
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,880
Huh?! There's something
in the middle of the street!

114
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,610
Eh?

115
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,880
What a weird face! What is this? A seal?

116
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,390
Looks like a weird mud figure,

117
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,280
but it's probably a religious statue.

118
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Morons! This is art! I can tell!

119
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,890
It's "Vearth."

120
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,610
The people of
the sky have forever admired it.

121
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,060
Vearth?

122
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,410
Eh?! You guys admire this thing?

123
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,480
You must be crazy...

124
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,700
Yes, I'm sure it must be difficult
for Blue Sea people to understand.

125
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,920
Oh, the docks are this way!

126
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,010
Eh?! We're already leaving town?!

127
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,430
What're you talking about?!
This isn't our destination!

128
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,180
C'mon, can't we hang around a little more?

129
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,070
Looks like it worked...

130
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,850
They went straight to the docks...

131
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,060
We're saved!

132
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh!

133
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,190
So many boats!

134
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,920
There are all kinds of boats anchored here.

135
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,430
From hotel ships where you can stay the night

136
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,430
to speed-oriented boats
loaded with giant dials.

137
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,560
There are many other kinds that--

138
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,840
Whoa! Check out this gondola!

139
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,560
It's so cool! Let's take it!

140
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,810
Look behind it!

141
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,560
This one can move on its own, like a waver!

142
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,450
This could turn into a fun gondola ride!

143
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,860
You idiot!

144
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,200
We're rescuing Nami-san
and Robin-chan! Get serious!

145
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,740
Oh, your boat is over here.

146
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,440
Right!

147
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,470
Eh?!

148
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,750
Oh, boy! What kind of gondola is it?!

149
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,170
The Crow!

150
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,810
You can't be serious!

151
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,060
Crows...

152
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,770
aren't even waterfowl.

153
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,110
I used it until just recently,
when I learned how to ride wavers.

154
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,140
It's not fast like a waver,

155
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,570
but it does have two Breath Dials on board!

156
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,780
Please feel free to use it!

157
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,330
No... I'm not going.

158
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,270
No... I'm not going.

159
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,000
Just as I expected!

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,290
He shows his true colors at the last minute!

161
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,790
There's no one in this world
who doesn't value his life!

162
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,620
I prefer that one instead.

163
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,780
He was just being selfish?

164
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,960
Y-You don't like it? I'm sorry. But...

165
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,760
You damn ingrate! Apologize!

166
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,740
Apologize to Conis-chan from
the bottom of your heart!

167
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,190
You scumbag!

168
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,420
Pay no attention to his selfishness!

169
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,500
Sorry!

170
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,300
N-No problem...

171
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,460
Your exit is Gate #2.

172
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,500
It will lead you to the giant Milky Road,
which connects to Upper Yard.

173
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,530
Y-You simply need to take that.

174
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,400
Hey. Conis.

175
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,420
Yes?

176
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,330
Why've you been shaking
ever since we left your house?

177
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,310
W-What the hell is he saying?!

178
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,500
D-Does it seem that way?

179
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,990
Yeah. It's like you're afraid of something...

180
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,370
No! She wouldn't!

181
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,740
Conis-chan! You're worried about us!

182
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,380
That's so touching!

183
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,340
Still, are you guys gonna be alright?!

184
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,320
Everyone in town is plainly avoiding us,

185
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,120
yet you're lending us your boat
and even giving us directions...

186
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,260
Doesn't that make you our accomplices?

187
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,730
Say, you're looking pale, too...

188
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,710
You should've told us if you were that scared.

189
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,700
We would've come on our own...

190
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,960
No.

191
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,990
I'm...

192
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,190
It's not what you think!

193
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,900
She wouldn't!

194
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,250
Don't say anything you shouldn't!

195
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,830
It's strange, isn't it?

196
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,140
Explaining the route to your "ordeal,"
guiding you here myself...

197
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,060
It's like I want to lead you there,
despite saying how terrifying it is...

198
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,940
Stop it! Don't say anything foolish!

199
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,280
Huh? What was that?!

200
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,460
Don't tell me they're all...

201
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,800
Why?! There's no need for that!

202
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,110
They're different...

203
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,270
Why do I need to guide them?
They're already headed for Upper Yard...

204
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,540
Yes,

205
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,150
if that were the case, I wouldn't
force this horrible job on you...

206
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,240
But most of the people we've
seen haven't been that way.

207
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,080
Once the initial excitement wears off,

208
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,640
everyone values their life more
than dreams and adventures...

209
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,230
We must lead them to the very end...

210
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,170
To Upper Yard...

211
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,100
Forgive me, Conis-san...

212
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,740
It is our citizens' duty.

213
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,690
It is his will.

214
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,840
Could you run away?

215
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,990
I'm sorry!

216
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,190
Stop!

217
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,630
What are you saying?!

218
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,590
I was the one who called
the Super-Express Lobster!

219
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,470
The thing that took Nami-san
and the others?! You called it?!

220
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,280
While you weren't on board,

221
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,090
I lied to them about a current
that leads to Cloud End

222
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,630
and had them raise the anchor.

223
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,060
That was the signal for the
Super-Express Lobster...

224
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,840
Foolish girl! Do you want to die?!

225
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,810
This is our duty!

226
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,570
Once we know someone's a criminal,

227
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,370
we'll be killed if we don't lead
them to the place of judgment!

228
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,420
Stop it! Do you realize what you're saying?!

229
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,940
You're blaspheming against God!

230
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,440
Stop her!

231
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,650
This is our citizens' duty...

232
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,180
Are you serious?!

233
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,820
I'm sorry!

234
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,410
It's all so strange, isn't it?!

235
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,660
Don't be stupid!

236
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,410
You didn't have any choice, right?!

237
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,820
Then...

238
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,960
...why are you telling us?!

239
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,150
Your life is in danger!

240
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,180
It's all over!

241
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,390
We're too late!

242
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,910
Stay away from the girl!

243
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,350
The judgment is coming!

244
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,970
No good! It's too big!

245
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,990
What was that?!

246
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,080
What just happened?!

247
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,470
Luffy!

248
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,230
Conis-chan! Hey! Where'd you go?!

249
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,410
Luffy! Conis!

250
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,940
It's no use...

251
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,410
The almighty God Eneru sees all...!

252
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,560
They are both safe.

253
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,260
It's Gan Fall-san!

254
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,430
Oh! That weird old man!

255
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,240
"Weird"?

256
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,720
No, I am the Sky Knight!

257
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,670
This one is on the house!

258
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,900
Thank goodness! Conis-chan...!

259
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,430
Leave this girl with me.

260
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,060
I will not allow Eneru to harm her.

261
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,490
Right!

262
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,850
You now know this land's true nature,
as well as "God's" power.

263
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,080
What will you do now?

264
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,530
This land is none of our business.

265
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,970
Our friends are on "God's Island"!

266
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,420
I see... May luck be with you.

267
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,590
What about them?

268
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,960
They have chosen their course.

269
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,020
It is no fault of yours.

270
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,290
I know who you are.

271
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,640
I am the Sky Knight.

272
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,050
No, we all know.

273
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,290
Please come back...

274
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,170
...God!

275
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,220
Get on! I'll give you a strong push out!

276
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,990
You're comin', too!

277
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,310
Alright, let's go to Upper Yard!

278
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,390
No...!

279
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,040
The bastards actually left...

280
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,020
With no hesitation or uncertainty at all...

281
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,360
Even if we're far apart

282
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,820
I don't want you to forget

283
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:38,290
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

284
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,010
You have a friend here to share the pain

285
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,560
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

286
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:59,150
I won't let it just be a dream

287
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:05,820
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

288
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:13,000
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

289
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,210
Is Conis gonna be alright?

290
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,020
All we can do is count on the old man!

291
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,340
We gotta save Nami-san and Robin-chan now!

292
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,570
There are two others.

293
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,680
Huh? What's that?

294
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,430
--Aaah! Aieee!
--Is it "God's ordeal"? Shut up!

295
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,190
Just keep moving forward!

296
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,410
Please let me go home!

297
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,700
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,660
"Onward, Crow! To the Sacrificial Altar"

299
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,860
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
