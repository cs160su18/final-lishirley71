00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,540
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,810
There's the signal...

22
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,610
Today is very promising!

23
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,250
You're going?! Your wounds from
that last battle still haven't--!

24
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,950
It's nothing! The conditions
are the same for both of us!

25
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,790
Making excuses during a
merciless fight to the death

26
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,460
would spoil my name!

27
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,340
Hey! Wait, old guy!

28
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,170
Don't go!

29
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,670
You can't go, Dorry-san!
You need to keep still!

30
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,040
You'll die if you push yourself too hard!

31
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,510
I, Warrior Dorry, am here...

32
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,820
At the very least...

33
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,150
...I will fight to uphold the name of Elbaf!

34
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,130
"Broggy's Bitter Tears of Victory!
The Conclusion of Elbaf"

35
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,730
Don't tell me he's--!

36
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,820
Awesome! He picked up
that gigantic rock!

37
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,350
Luffy-san!

38
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,930
What're you doing, old guy?!
Move this rock! Hey!

39
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,960
It can't be stopped...

40
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,940
It was over a hundred years ago...

41
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,080
...when we started the battle.

42
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,650
But running from a battle you've started...

43
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,950
...is the same as running
from the title of "warrior."

44
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,090
If I am no longer a warrior...

45
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,190
...I will no longer be me.

46
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,060
I'm sorry I suspected you.

47
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,940
This is the judgment given by...

48
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,440
...Elbaf, the god of war.

49
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,740
I didn't have his
divine protection. That's all.

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,680
Gods and divine protection and
all that have nothing to do with this!

51
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
If a god told you to die, would you?!

52
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,760
This duel has been interfered with!

53
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,700
A duel that's been interfered
with isn't a duel anymore!

54
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,030
--Isn't that right?!
--Be quiet!

55
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,710
You've lived only a mere 10 or 20 years--

56
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,710
you wouldn't understand
the grand words of Elbaf!

57
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,480
Who gives a crap about that?!
Hey! Move this thing! Hey! Old guy!

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,190
Hey! Old guy! Hey! Dammit!

59
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,290
I can't move this!

60
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,430
Okay, Master Broggy! Go get 'im!

61
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,600
You bet, Usopp!

62
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,770
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with him for sure this time!

63
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,010
Go get 'im, Warrior of Elbaf!

64
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,180
You can do it!

65
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,150
You're strong! Strong! Strong!

66
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,850
You're big! Big!

67
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,960
How can he keep doing
this pointless fighting?

68
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,890
Don't call it pointless fighting, you idiot!

69
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,060
Broggy's a brave warrior of the sea,
like the kind I'm aiming to be!

70
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,360
What gives you the right--

71
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,130
Anyways, let's return to the ship.

72
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,870
Waiting a year for the Log to
store up is out of the question!

73
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,170
We need to wait on the ship for
everyone and come up with a plan.

74
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,770
Hold it! Not so fast!

75
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,450
I am absolutely useless in
a fight against dinosaurs!

76
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,920
As such, we cannot possibly traverse
the jungle to reach our ship!

77
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,020
What was all that "brave warrior
of the sea" stuff just now, then?

78
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,520
I meant that in the mental sense!

79
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,090
I want to be a man who's
proud of the way he lives!

80
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,300
No choice.

81
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,400
Luffy's group is at the
other giant's house.

82
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,000
Guess we'll head there...

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,470
Listen, Nami.

84
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,170
Even if I wind up
losing everything someday

85
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,480
and greet death all alone
on a deserted island,

86
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,050
I'll proudly say this
about my life as I die:

87
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,680
"I am Usopp, brave warrior of the sea!"

88
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,290
Yeah, yeah.

89
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,890
Then will you hurry up
and be a dependable warrior?

90
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,220
Oh...

91
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,560
Alright!

92
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,370
Dorry! How was your drink?!
Hit the spot, didn't it?!

93
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,510
Yeah... It tasted "godly"...

94
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,550
You're so full of exaggerations! Let's go!

95
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,920
What's wrong, Dorry?!
You're a bit sluggish!

96
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,990
Don't be a fool!
I'm the same as always!

97
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,480
Move, you stupid thing! Come on!

98
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,550
Just when it seemed like
I met an awesome warrior!

99
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,890
Luffy-san...

100
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,290
Why would he go this far
for a giant he just met?

101
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,570
He hardly seems like a criminal
with a bounty on his head...

102
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,840
Who is it?! Who's putting
a damper on the giants' fight?!

103
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,240
Come to think of it...

104
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,680
...Karoo is gone!

105
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,900
Oh? Isn't this ugly bird the one
the princess always has with her?

106
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,230
Yeah.

107
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,420
Don't run away!

108
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,720
We were lucky enough
to meet out here, after all.

109
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,660
There's something we'd like you to do.

110
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,900
That's right.

111
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,980
Damn. I'm lost.

112
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,180
I do recognize this tree, but...

113
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,580
It was, "Go left from the
tree wrapped in vines," right?

114
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,720
Oh! It's you, Nami!

115
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,520
Perfect timing!

116
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,160
I just lost my way, you see,
so I wasn't sure what to do...

117
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,730
What're you doing here, anyway?

118
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,970
Hey. What's the deal?

119
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,940
Dinosaur!

120
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,840
Dinosaur! Dinosaur! Dinosaur!

121
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,080
Hey, you! You're too fast!

122
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,420
Urgh, that guy...

123
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,890
Luffy!

124
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,350
What a relief!

125
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,890
What are you doing here?

126
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,070
N-Nami?

127
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,300
Nami! Nami! Nami! Nami!

128
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,770
This is not good...

129
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,700
Luffy!

130
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,460
Luffy!

131
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,860
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

132
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,400
Luffy!

133
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,140
Oww...

134
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,640
Terrible news! A dinosaur ate Nami!

135
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,110
Seriously?!

136
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,980
We were running through
the jungle to get away from it,

137
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,510
and then suddenly she was gone!

138
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,820
Oh! What do I do now?!
I let my friend get killed!

139
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,930
H-Hold on! Calm down, you two!

140
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:34,260
If she suddenly disappeared,
does that mean you don't know for sure?

141
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,870
Are you crazy?! I was too
terrified to check and make sure!

142
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,600
If it wasn't a dinosaur,
it was a wild beast!

143
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,670
What else could it have been?!

144
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,610
I don't know.

145
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,940
But if people from Baroque Works
have followed us onto this island,

146
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,450
then it'd make sense that only
Nami-san was targeted and not you.

147
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,790
Eh?! Baroque Works is on the island?!

148
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,260
But... why wouldn't they go after me?

149
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,900
Because you're most likely not on
Baroque Works's assassination list.

150
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,560
Oh, I see!

151
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,040
Plus, that alcohol might've
been meant for us, too!

152
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,310
Alcohol?! What about alcohol?!

153
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,580
Broggy brought your alcohol to Dorry.

154
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,580
And when Dorry drank it,
it exploded inside his stomach.

155
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,320
What?! Alcohol exploded
inside his stomach?!

156
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,720
You're saying he went to the
battlefield all busted up like that?!

157
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,990
I tried to stop him,
but I wound up like this instead!

158
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,200
You can't be serious!

159
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,340
Those two've fought evenly for
100 years with all their might!

160
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,250
It's probably the most pride-filled
battle in the entire world!

161
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,320
--Yeah...
--They can't settle the fight like this now!

162
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,660
What's wrong?!

163
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,380
He's still fighting.

164
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,750
Yes. Dorry the Blue Ogre
is quite stubborn indeed.

165
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,350
Perhaps I should assist one of them.

166
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,140
One century...

167
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,410
It was a long battle!

168
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,090
This is the judgment given
by Elbaf, the god of war.

169
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,770
I didn't have his
divine protection. That's all.

170
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,840
--Luffy!
--Luffy-san?!

171
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,950
Who was it?!

172
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,450
Show yourself!

173
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,060
Mr. 3. I think I heard something.

174
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,770
How funny! An underdog loser,
yelping out here in the jungle!

175
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,290
Seventy-three thousand...

176
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,060
...four hundred sixty-seven fights...

177
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:09,270
73,466 draws...

178
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,610
...and one win!

179
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,370
Joyful tears of victory, huh?
Simpleminded people have it so easy.

180
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,840
Though, perhaps I'll
congratulate you for now.

181
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,640
Joyful tears?!

182
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,740
What would you know?!
Just who are you?!

183
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,820
Mr. 3. Please excuse the codename.
I'm a mere formative artist.

184
00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:00,260
And this is my realist painter assistant,
Miss Golden Week.

185
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,560
What's more, I've already captured you.

186
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,860
W-What is this?!

187
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,720
Alright, Luffy!

188
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,950
I dunno who we're dealing with,
but I'll go take care of them myself!

189
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,050
I'm coming, too!

190
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,090
Yes! Please come with me!
That'd be reassuring!

191
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,930
There's no need for that!

192
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,630
You guys!

193
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,180
You can have him back.
We don't need him.

194
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,450
Karoo!

195
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,420
Why, you...!

196
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,090
Hey, who are they?

197
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,250
The guys from that last town!

198
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,190
What are you doing here?!
Karoo has nothing to do with this!

199
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,660
That's right. This bird has
absolutely nothing to do with this.

200
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,400
The only one we considered
dangerous was that "straw hat man."

201
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,440
We were planning to lure you both
out by having this bird squawk,

202
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,540
but he was just too obstinate.

203
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,650
Alright! Call for your owner!

204
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,220
Squawk especially loud
and we'll let you go!

205
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,090
Fine! Want us to make you squawk?!

206
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,230
Call for the princess!

207
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,530
Call for help this instant!

208
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,170
Open your mouth, you damn bird!

209
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,080
But then we saw Straw Hat already
took himself out of the picture.

210
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,920
So we have no use
for that thing anymore.

211
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,390
Karoo...

212
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,660
What a stupid bird!

213
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,800
Why, you...!

214
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,100
Are you the ones who
put a bomb in the alcohol?!

215
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,800
Yes, that was us. Who're you?

216
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Is he on the list?

217
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,440
No. He must be their friend.
But let's make him disappear, too!

218
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,440
So you interfered with the giants' duel!

219
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,110
It was them?! I'll kick their asses!

220
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,380
You're the ones who
are going to disappear!

221
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,220
Oh? You're going to try
struggling, Miss Wednesday?

222
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,260
Do you stand a chance
against us Officer Agents?

223
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,300
Peacock Slasher!

224
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Take this! Special Attack: Exploding Star!

225
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,400
Yes!

226
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,540
What a nice explosive blast!

227
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
Nose Fancy Cannon!

228
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,350
What a pity!

229
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,290
Usopp!

230
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,820
10,000 Kilogram Press!

231
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,060
Calm down, now!

232
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,110
There's no need to be so upset.
We're not going to kill you just yet.

233
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,710
We only came to abduct you.
On Mr. 3's orders...

234
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,490
Mr. 3?! The Wax-Wax Fruit man?!
He's on this island?!

235
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,160
That's right.

236
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,530
He's a "candle man" who controls
the wax he secretes from his body.

237
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,800
A candle man?!

238
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

239
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

240
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

241
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

242
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,170
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

243
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

244
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

245
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

246
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

247
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

248
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

249
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

250
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,520
Usopp! Can you let them
get away with this?!

251
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,850
No...

252
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,690
Can you not stand this, either?!

253
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,590
Alright! Let's all three of us
go beat them senseless!

254
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,530
Let's do it! Usopp! Bird!

255
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,060
Yeah!

256
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

257
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,830
"The Devilish Candle!
Tears of Regret and Tears of Anger"

258
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
