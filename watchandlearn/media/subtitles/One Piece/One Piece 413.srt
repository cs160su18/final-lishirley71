2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,290
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,200
After being ejected from the Sabaody
Archipelago by Bartholomew Kuma,

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,390
Luffy was separated from
his friends and arrived alone

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,810
at the female-only empire of Amazon Lily.

53
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,260
Big Sis!

54
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,920
Big Sis! What happened?!

55
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,220
What in the world happened?!

56
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,630
Oh, I, uhh...

57
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,460
He saw my back.

58
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,070
After seeing the secret hidden on the
back of Pirate Empress Boa Hancock,

59
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,050
Luffy was caught by the Kuja Pirates
and taken to a fighting arena.

60
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,510
Love-Love Beam!

61
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,850
Hey...!

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,220
Hey, you! What did you do to them?!

63
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,900
They saved my life, you know!

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,090
This is the warrior nation of Amazon Lily.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,620
The strong are beautiful.

66
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,720
Fight your hardest and perish.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,770
We will watch and see you off.

68
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,420
You guys are screwed up.

69
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,770
That woman...

70
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,190
She turned your comrades into stone,

71
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,950
so how can you all sit
there and laugh like that?!

72
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,400
Th-The savage is yelling at us!

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,490
Unbelievable! What a vicious creature!

74
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,720
I feel bad about those three,

75
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,730
but the Snake Princess was
right to do what she did!

76
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,900
They're the ones to blame! They
broke the rules of our land!

77
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,720
Whatever I do,

78
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,260
I will be forgiven.

79
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,810
The reason for that is,

80
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,520
yes...

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,140
...because I'm beautiful!

82
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,520
You piss me off!

83
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,270
These guys have powers?

84
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,790
"A Difficult Fight for Luffy!
The Snake Sisters' Haki Power!!"

85
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,110
Execution! Execution!

86
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,380
Execution! Execution!...

87
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,450
The younger sisters'
Snake Pit Dance is about to start!

88
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,310
I can't wait to see Marigold-sama's
"Salamander" with my own eyes!

89
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,160
"Youngest Sister, Marigold Snake-Snake
Fruit, Model King Cobra"

90
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,900
And Sandersonia-sama's
"Eight-Headed Serpent"!

91
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,840
"Middle Sister, Sandersonia
Snake-Snake Fruit, Model Anaconda"

92
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,000
How magnificent she looks!

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,310
She was a strong warrior
to beat the Gorgon monster,

94
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,890
and this is proof of it!

95
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,900
The cursed younger sisters are lovely too!

96
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,850
Cursed? What're they talking about?

97
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,160
They look like they've
eaten Devil Fruits to me.

98
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,430
He's finished for sure now!

99
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,600
I can't wait anymore! Hurry and start!

100
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
Execution! Execution!

101
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,740
Execution!...

102
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,440
Perhaps I should swallow him whole...

103
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,740
Or squeeze him to death...

104
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,600
Don't tell me he's scared stiff!

105
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,720
Just stand there and die!

106
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,910
Hold on! Time out!

107
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,340
What? Going to beg for your life?

108
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,030
Apologizing now won't
make your crimes go away!

109
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,790
No, it's not that.

110
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,920
What's going on?

111
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,390
Look!

112
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,870
There!

113
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,480
You're not cracked, are you?

114
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,880
Wait here, you guys!

115
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,100
Sorry you got turned
into stone because of me!

116
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,470
If Chopper were here,
he could've examined you right away,

117
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,110
but maybe you'll go back to normal again

118
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,650
like when Aokiji turned
me and Robin into ice!

119
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,480
Are you sure you shouldn't be
more concerned about yourself?

120
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,990
Shut up! I can do whatever I want!

121
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,610
That man...

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,090
Is he trying to save Margaret and the others?

123
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,490
That can't be!

124
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,010
He's already been sentenced to death!

125
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,270
Alright, then...

126
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,680
So I just gotta kick your asses now, right?!

127
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,780
What a joke!

128
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,010
What did he just say?!

129
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,780
He intends to beat the younger sisters!

130
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,870
Hilarious! Making people laugh
after being sentenced to death!

131
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,590
Men really are hilarious!

132
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,420
Is that okay, beating you up?

133
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,930
Yes, that's fine!

134
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,710
If you haven't given up on your life yet,
then I'll warn you in advance:

135
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,390
I wouldn't fall into the pit between
the seats and the ring if I were you!

136
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,710
You can fall if you'd like,

137
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,920
but the bottom is filled with blades, so...

138
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,400
Are you ready to go now?

139
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,650
Yeah! All set!

140
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,490
Good.

141
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,420
Then let's begin!

142
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,580
Kill him, Sandersonia! Marigold!

143
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,750
Through combat,
give him the ultimate punishment

144
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,040
for the great crime of sneaking onto
our maiden island and offending me!

145
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,040
I've been waiting for this!

146
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,940
I guess he has some skill...

147
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,950
Get him, Marigold-sama!

148
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,490
What the...?!

149
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,840
Poison?! That was close!

150
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,490
Wrong! It's powerful poison!

151
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,900
Gum-Gum...

152
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,370
...Stamp!

153
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,880
It bounced off!

154
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,710
That hurts!

155
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,870
How...?! I'm made of rubber!

156
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,210
See! He really is all bark and no bite!

157
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,770
But it's true that men stretch! How neat!

158
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,480
Huh?! Am I not rubber anymore?!

159
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,220
No, that's not it!

160
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,210
Then why do impact blows hurt?!

161
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,000
That's not fair, Mari!

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,110
You're hogging him all to yourself!

163
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,410
I want to have some fun with him too!

164
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,830
Why does that hurt?! I'm made of rubber!

165
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,220
Come to think of it, that axe guy also...!

166
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,340
Gum-Gum...

167
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,890
...Gatling!

168
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,500
Hoisa!

169
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
Wh-What the...?!

170
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,430
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

171
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,590
It's exactly the same!

172
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,610
But he didn't have powers!

173
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
Does that mean it's not a Devil Fruit power?

174
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,030
I take it you have powers, too.

175
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,650
A Paramythia type, from the looks of it?

176
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,090
I knew it!

177
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,360
Why are you lying and saying you're cursed?!

178
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,680
That's a secret we can't tell anyone,

179
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,550
not even an opponent about to die.

180
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,160
Damn!

181
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,010
But I take it you can't use Haki?

182
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,480
Most outsiders can't.

183
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,410
That's why you're weak.

184
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,380
Left kick...

185
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,430
Over here!

186
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,640
She read what I was going to do!

187
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,310
Snake Slam!

188
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,230
Yes!

189
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,030
That one didn't hurt.

190
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,360
Same as usual.

191
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,270
Gum-Gum...

192
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,160
...Gatling!

193
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,910
Snake Dance.

194
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,390
What amazing moves!

195
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,460
With Sonia-sama's Haki,
there's no attack she can't dodge!

196
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,500
You're very straightforward.

197
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,120
I can read you like a book.

198
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
What's going on?!

199
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,380
She's guessing my every move!

200
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,300
Focusing entirely on offense
is nice and all, but...

201
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,090
Snake Stick!

202
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,640
Ouch!

203
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,260
Don't forget that there are two of us!

204
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,810
Not good!

205
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,350
He's falling into the pit!

206
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,850
Something seemed unnatural
about that just now...

207
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,970
That man...!

208
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,740
Th-That was close!

209
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,900
So close!

210
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,050
He should've just kept falling!

211
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,890
However tenacious he is,

212
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,760
he still doesn't stand a chance
against the younger sisters!

213
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,070
They're at the very top of the Kuja Pirates!

214
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,450
The Snake Princess put
her hair behind her ear!

215
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,240
Her loveliness knows no bounds!

216
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,630
This man is the very definition
of "nothing but talk."

217
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,880
I can't help but laugh.

218
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,060
Shut up, you dumbass!

219
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,740
Oh, my!

220
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,530
He spoke abusively to
the Snake Princess again!

221
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,940
Unforgivable! Hurry and kill him!

222
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,070
Sonia! Mari!

223
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,730
End that man's life at once!

224
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,450
To ensure there are no further outbursts...

225
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,650
...from his filthy mouth!

226
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,350
I was hoping to have
a little more fun with you,

227
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,040
but you heard our big sister!

228
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,090
It looks like playtime is over now.

229
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,600
Let's give the criminal despair and death!

230
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,650
Margaret!

231
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,070
Hey! What're you doing?! Don't touch them!

232
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,980
What if she breaks?!

233
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,070
She saved my life, you know!

234
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,510
We are going to break her.

235
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,000
You said she saved your life.

236
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Then that's all the more reason to.

237
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,590
I feel bad for her,

238
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,420
but this is your punishment.

239
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,690
Don't be stupid!

240
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,590
This duel is between me and you!

241
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,050
Stop it!

242
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,390
Above.

243
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,720
Hey, you!

244
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,860
Damn! Let go!

245
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,890
You're the only one who
thinks this is a duel.

246
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,710
This is a public execution!

247
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,760
Just sit there and watch!

248
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,220
The emotional trauma you gave our
sister goes much further than this!

249
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,800
Everyone here looks up to the Snake Princess!

250
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,710
She's strong, noble, and the most
beautiful woman in the world!

251
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,860
The Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock!

252
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,060
Hey! Stop it!

253
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,820
She looked up to you guys, you know!

254
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,570
Everyone in this land does.

255
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,780
So I think this is what she would want!

256
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,370
The hell it is!

257
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,990
What are you, stupid?!

258
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,580
Oh, my. What crude language.

259
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,130
After her, we'll break the other two as well.

260
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,050
Nice and slowly, too.

261
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,680
That'd make it more painful
for you too, right?

262
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
Here goes!

263
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,520
Three...

264
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,860
Hey! Stop!

265
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,280
Two...

266
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,930
Stop it! Do you hear me?!

267
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,350
It's no use.

268
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,200
One...

269
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,110
Margaret!

270
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,580
I said stop!

271
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,170
The warriors are fainting!

272
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,150
Could this be...?!

273
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,960
What a relief!

274
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,150
She isn't hurt anywhere!

275
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,500
Oh, I guess you guys are sensible after all!

276
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,450
That was the Conqueror's Spirit just now...!

277
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,580
This can't be real!

278
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,620
Only one out of a million
people can master that Haki!

279
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,930
Only a chosen few can use it!

280
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,890
I've never seen any person who
can use it other than our big sister!

281
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,300
This boy has the "qualities of a conqueror"
to stand above others!

282
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,840
He has the Conqueror's Spirit, just as I do?!

283
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,940
How can this be?!

284
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,640
Is he no mere boy after all?!

285
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,330
Just who is that guy?!

286
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,410
What's everyone blabbing about?

287
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,720
What's the big deal?

288
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,030
He doesn't realize he used Haki?!

289
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,190
I guess he hasn't figured
out how to control it.

290
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,360
Alright!

291
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,060
You showed me you're strong!

292
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,020
Now let's get on with the duel!

293
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Luffy activates Second Gear,

294
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,750
and the sisters respond by unleashing
their true Snake-Snake powers.

295
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,180
Sandersonia's hair turns into giant serpents

296
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,740
while Marigold cloaks her body in flames,

297
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,230
and the sisters continue their attack.

298
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,670
On the next episode of One Piece!

299
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,800
"All-Out Special Power Battle!!
Gum-Gum vs. Snake-Snake"

300
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,950
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
