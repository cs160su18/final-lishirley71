2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,740
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,080
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,140
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,000
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,700
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,140
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,580
Throw that gas mask away!

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,090
You're no longer one of us.

26
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,350
Die!

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,080
I won't let you shoot poison gas!

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,470
Stop scampering about, anchor boy!

29
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,860
D-Dammit!

30
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,580
Ghin! You don't have to listen
to what that weakling says!

31
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,810
I'm gonna kick his ass now!

32
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,710
Don't mock Don Krieg!

33
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,940
He's the strongest man.
You can't defeat him.

34
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,360
Come to your senses, you idiot!
That man is trying to kill you!

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,860
I deserve it...

36
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,650
since I couldn't fulfill my role,
shamelessly losing to emotion...

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,030
This is... This is a
well-deserved punishment!

38
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,280
Ghin!

39
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,750
Why... Why?

40
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,460
Ha! So you showed your pride
at the end... But it's too late.

41
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,170
Die together with that cook!

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,210
Deadly Poison Gas Bomb... M... H... 5!

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,070
"I Won't Die!
Fierce Battle, Luffy vs. Krieg!"

44
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,240
It's coming!!

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,680
Dive into the sea!!

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,210
Owner! Get inside the restaurant!!

47
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,100
Let me borrow those.

48
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,850
Sanji! Ghin! Use these!

49
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,850
Chore boy!

50
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,800
Now for mine!

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,250
Ahh! Everyone dived into the sea!

52
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,970
Ahhh! What do I do?! What do I do?!
What do I do?! What do I do?!

53
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,100
Huh?!

54
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,540
This is force.

55
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,460
I... I'm saved... Good thing
I found that mask when I did...

56
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,010
Wh-What a crazy bastard...

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,010
I can't believe he used
poison gas in battle...

58
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,020
He's a devil...

59
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,200
Yeah, no human being
would do something like that!

60
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,650
Are Sanji and the chore boy okay?

61
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,900
Not sure... Look!
The poison mist is clearing up!

62
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,810
Ghin!

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,800
Let go...

64
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,040
Let go of the mask!

65
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,390
Ghin!

66
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,890
Where's your mask?!

67
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,070
Did you... give me your mask?

68
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,070
Ghin!

69
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,980
What an idiot.

70
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,680
You're in pain right now
because you feel indebted

71
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,070
just because someone
gave you some food.

72
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,790
Well, I guess idiots
don't learn until they die...

73
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,060
That bastard... even after he threw
the gas mask away as ordered...

74
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,170
Is that how he talks
to his loyal subordinate?!

75
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,700
Don... Don Krieg...

76
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,710
Ghin...

77
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,170
Ghin... It seems...

78
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,930
It seems that you picked
the wrong man to follow...

79
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,000
So you're actually sympathizing
with that idiot scum?

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,930
Scum?!

81
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,270
That's right.

82
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,760
An idiot who loses sight of our
goal and can't follow my orders

83
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,980
no longer holds value to me.

84
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,650
There's no guarantee that
he won't betray me again.

85
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,450
It's out of love that I put him out of
his misery now. Wouldn't you agree?

86
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,290
I-I never imagined that Don would
actually kill the Chief Commander...

87
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,260
C-Can't be true...
There's no way he would!

88
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,250
Ghin-san is his right-hand man!

89
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,660
That's right. No one has been more
faithful to Don than Ghin-san!

90
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,100
That time, too. When Fullbody's
Navy ship came after us

91
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,140
right after we escaped
from the Grand Line...

92
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,240
Yeah... He acted as
a decoy all by himself,

93
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,140
pretending to be Don...

94
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,320
He always risked his life
fighting for Don Krieg...

95
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,010
I never imagined... that Don
would actually try to kill him...

96
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,690
How evil...

97
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,660
Patty! We have an antidote, don't we?!

98
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, we do...
but that's for food poisoning.

99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,830
It doesn't matter what it is,
just bring it over here!

100
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,170
Idiot! If you wanna save him,
put the mask on him right away!

101
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,700
It should have some sort
of detoxifying effect!

102
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,110
Bring him to the second floor
and let him breathe well.

103
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,020
If there's a chance to save him,
that's the only way!

104
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,980
Hurry up, Patty! Carne!

105
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,120
All right already!

106
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,510
Me too?!

107
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,460
Ha! It's no use. Even if he stays alive,
it'll be an hour at most...

108
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,730
Don't you dare die, Ghin.

109
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,210
Don't let someone like him kill you!

110
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,670
Cling to life! Got that?!
I'll kick his ass for you!

111
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,170
D-Don't. You can't... defeat him...

112
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,750
Cool down! Attacking head-on

113
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,890
would be playing right
into his hands. You'll die!

114
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
I won't die.

115
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
Go ahead and shoot
as much as you want.

116
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,930
Hey!

117
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,650
Such a fool... The easiest enemy
to kill is one who's in a frenzy.

118
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,440
The sea is your hell, anchor boy.
You're heading towards...

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,120
Here comes...

120
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,910
Bombs!

121
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,610
...your graveyard!

122
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,410
My graveyard?!

123
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,280
Oh, no! Get out of there, chore boy!

124
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,910
He got hit!

125
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,650
He's dead...

126
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,570
Chore boy...

127
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,150
You little...

128
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,470
Gum-Gum...

129
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,350
Hit me...

130
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,060
Here it comes!

131
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,940
...if you can!

132
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,150
How dirty! That's...

133
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,890
...Pistol!!

134
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,650
What?!

135
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,180
Don Krieg got beaten!

136
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,310
What the hell is he?!

137
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,690
He hit him along with the porcupine!

138
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,320
Ouch...

139
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,360
Holy shit...

140
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,700
We've never even seen
Don brought to his knees...

141
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,160
He hit Don in his face! And he did it
through that Porcupine Cape!

142
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,910
C... Can you believe that?!

143
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,380
Is this... my graveyard?

144
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,180
Or... your graveyard?

145
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,950
My... graveyard?!

146
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,330
Don't think... you can send me
to my grave with stuff like this.

147
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,250
I'm not gonna die here.

148
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,510
He's crazy...

149
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,570
You see idiots like that
every once in a while...

150
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,100
...ones who will fight to the death once
they've set their eyes on a target...

151
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,500
Fight... to the death...

152
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,670
You're in trouble if someone
like that becomes your enemy.

153
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,620
But you know, win or lose,
I like guys like him...

154
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,460
Hey, underling!

155
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,380
Hang in there!

156
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,420
Now, breathe!
Breathe in a lot of good air!

157
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,780
Are you all right? Hey!
Do you want to drink some water? Hey!

158
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,190
This isn't good.

159
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,190
Do you wanna eat my
special pudding? It's good!

160
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,340
Idiot! You want to feed
poison to a poisoned man?!

161
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,670
Hey, what do you mean by
poison?! You're one to talk!

162
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,640
What'd you say?! People say my
meat dishes are the best in the world!

163
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,550
They're considered so delicious
that people think they're in heaven.

164
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,040
Ahh! You can't die on us!

165
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Hey! C'mon! Don't die, underling!

166
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,020
A-Are you dead? Are you really dead?!
Hey! Really? Are you dead?

167
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,890
Hey! Are you dead? Really?
Are you really dead?!

168
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,850
Shut up!!

169
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,560
Phew, he's still alive...

170
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:20,160
D... Don Krieg... Is Don Krieg...

171
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,450
Wh-What's gonna happen to this fight?

172
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,480
Idiot! That was just dumb luck!

173
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,750
There's no way Don would be defeated
by a stupid brat like that! Don't worry!

174
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,170
Chore boy...

175
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,070
"I'm not gonna die here," you said?

176
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,610
If you won't die here... then...

177
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,140
...who the hell will?!

178
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,540
You will, right?!

179
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,310
You will!!

180
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,040
Don got beaten again!
What the hell is going on?!

181
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,630
E-Enemies are supposed to die
without even touching Don Krieg...

182
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,530
Don's supposed to be
invincible... What the...

183
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,880
What the hell is that brat?!

184
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,340
He's really good!

185
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,980
Yeah... I'm blown away...

186
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,390
He's amazing!

187
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,240
Get Krieg!

188
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,220
Yeah, he can do it!

189
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,670
That brat is fighting Don
at his level, without a doubt...

190
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,840
This isn't a dream, right? Don getting
beaten by someone like him...

191
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,670
Don's supposed to be invincible...

192
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,670
As it stands, the legend of
Don Krieg the strongest will be...

193
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,190
Stop talking nonsense!!

194
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,530
What the...

195
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,040
F... Finally, Don Krieg's
strongest weapon...

196
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,430
The Mighty Battle Spear!

197
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,200
What's that? It exploded.

198
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,200
Now... I'll see how long you
can keep avoiding this...

199
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,700
It'll be a sight, anchor boy.

200
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,640
That puny spear from earlier still
left you standing after a few attacks,

201
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,150
but this Mighty Battle Spear is different.

202
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,210
As soon as you touch it,
you'll be blown to pieces!!

203
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,800
Wh-What's with that spear?!

204
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,230
I'll fall, I'll fall, I'll fall...

205
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,760
Wh-What's with that spear?

206
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,320
It explodes every time
he strikes it down?

207
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,800
What? My knees...

208
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,340
A long battle will be trouble...

209
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,990
He's shed too much blood...
He's not gonna last long...

210
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,170
Your overdoing it has
taken its toll on you.

211
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,970
You must be reaching your limit...

212
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,050
Darn! With the foothold
rocking like this,

213
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,050
I can't fight with full power.

214
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,410
I'm stumped.

215
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,830
That Mighty Battle Spear
never ceases to amaze me.

216
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,600
Yeah. The stronger that
big spear is struck down,

217
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
the bigger the explosion it causes.

218
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,150
It's something that no one
other than Don can handle!

219
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,350
But how powerful he is...

220
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,080
To think he easily swings around
that super heavy spear,

221
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,560
which weighs 1 ton with
those two shoulder guards!

222
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,070
That's exactly the reason
why Don is the strongest!

223
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,430
Wooaahhh...

224
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,890
Take this!

225
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,730
Die!!

226
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,650
Chore boy!

227
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,270
Phew... That was close...

228
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,160
You... damn caterpillar!!

229
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,490
Waaahhh!

230
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,280
Chore boy!!

231
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,140
Chore boy...

232
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,840
Are you all right?!

233
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,860
Ha! I'm not quite done yet...

234
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,870
You made me angry.
I won't let you die so easily.

235
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,970
Dammit! That bastard Krieg brings
out weapons one after another...

236
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,330
There's no way that chore boy can...

237
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,890
Even if hundreds of
weapons are built in,

238
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,830
he can be defeated by someone
with a spear of blind determination.

239
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,770
Hmph! How easy...

240
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,200
Now that makes you worth crushing...

241
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,310
Life or death...

242
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,240
In a pirate battle, if you fear death
for even a moment, you'll fall to pieces.

243
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,170
What're you talking about?

244
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,740
At least...

245
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
At least...

246
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,540
...that kid doesn't have any hesitation!

247
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,810
Is it a survival instinct?

248
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,390
Or does he not fear death
because he has faith in himself?

249
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,760
Faith...

250
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,990
Y... You son of a bitch!!

251
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,980
Alright! You're amazing!

252
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,140
Chore boy! Go for it!!

253
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,300
Get him!

254
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,930
I told you... that this is where you die!!

255
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,180
I am the strongest man!!

256
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,070
The fleet Krieg gathered...
His hundreds of weapons and poison...

257
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,540
If they're all force...

258
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,530
...then that kid's spear is also force...

259
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,050
The spear held in his heart...

260
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,890
I know an idiot who's holding back
that spear for a stupid reason...

261
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,040
M-My Mighty Battle Spear is...
What the hell did you do?!

262
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,070
I gave it five punches.

263
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,590
I guess that's it for your spear.

264
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,710
Prepare yourself...

265
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

266
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

267
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

268
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

269
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

270
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

271
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,870
so that my memories won't fade

272
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,590
Why is he fighting when
his body's falling apart?

273
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,890
Is he trying to get himself killed?!
No, he isn't even thinking about dying.

274
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,490
Risking life for an ambition and dream...
I used to have a dream like that!

275
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,620
This is it!!

276
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,820
Chore boy! Don't die in a place like this!

277
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

278
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,830
"The Conclusion of the Deadly Battle!
A Spear of Blind Determination!"

279
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,330
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
