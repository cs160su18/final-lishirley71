2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,270
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,060
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,190
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,240
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,770
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,430
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,660
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,080
Nami's group was planning
to escape from Upper Yard

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,040
when God Eneru appeared
and demonstrated his might.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,690
Meanwhile, the four search team
members wound up separated,

21
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,740
and Luffy was confronted by
the Shandian warrior Wyper.

22
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,460
Gum-Gum...

23
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,820
Burn...

24
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,620
Bazooka!

25
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,690
Nami's group then encountered a new enemy...

26
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,400
Don't play dumb! My name is Hotori!

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,710
My name is Kotori!

28
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,370
You guys killed our brother!

29
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,440
And Chopper, after losing his way,
encountered Priest Gedatsu.

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,690
Where did you go?!

31
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,710
Yikes!

32
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,180
"The Ordeal of the Swamp!
Chopper vs. Sky Punk Gedatsu!!"

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,660
A memorial for the very city itself...

34
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,880
Descendants built this after the city fell...

35
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,330
Shandora... That was this
ancient city's name...

36
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,750
402 S.E.

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,410
The city flourished over 1,100 years ago,

38
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,870
and it was 800 years ago when it fell.

39
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,560
That matches the "Blank Century"
that's missing throughout the world.

40
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,830
This island might know
about the "unspoken history"

41
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,260
that's gone from the world below.

42
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,570
This is a complete map of Shandora...

43
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,410
Perhaps I'll find more clues
about the "unspeakable history"

44
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,020
in the center of the city...

45
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,520
Who's there?!

46
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,540
Why, hello there, cutie-pie.

47
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,140
Are you another of God's henchmen?!

48
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,970
Henchmen?

49
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,530
Watch your mouth.

50
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,030
I am Yama, Divine Commander for God Eneru!

51
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,900
So, what brings you here, Divine Commander?

52
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,870
Enough talk!

53
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,990
Where did you disappear to?!

54
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,230
Eh?!

55
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,410
A concealment technique?!

56
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,230
Oh! His eyes are rolled back in his head!

57
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,400
That's so scary!

58
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,280
Gedatsu-sama! You cannot see the
enemy with your eyes rolled back!

59
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,750
How careless of me!

60
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,470
Is this guy an idiot?!

61
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,420
An enemy?! I guess so, huh?!
Are you... a priest?!

62
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,010
Indeed, I am! Heso!
My name is Sky Punk Gedatsu!

63
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,770
Priest of the almighty God Eneru!

64
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,440
I am in charge of Upper
Yard's "Swamp Ordeal"!

65
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,180
Say something, you jerk!

66
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,780
Gedatsu-sama! He cannot hear you
unless you speak out loud!

67
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,620
How careless of me!

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,860
Is that something you normally forget?!

69
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,250
You had best watch your step!
This area is already my territory!

70
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,790
We are surrounded by Swamp Clouds!

71
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,880
Once you're caught by one,
there is no way to escape on your own!

72
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,370
The survival rate here is 50%--

73
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,720
How careless of me!

74
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,810
Swamp?!

75
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,560
The "Swamp Ordeal"!

76
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,430
You're sinking?!

77
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,900
Fool! It has no effect on me!

78
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,940
Swamp Cloud...

79
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,180
...Milky Dials!

80
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,210
Wow! Awesome!

81
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,680
He's shooting stuff out of his feet to fly!

82
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,840
So cool!

83
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,420
Something came out of his hands, too...

84
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,390
A single raccoon dog will
be no trouble at all.

85
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,520
Take this!

86
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,980
Swamp Cloud Burger!

87
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,450
With the weight of a cloud,
and the properties of a swamp!

88
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,160
Once you touch it,
there is no hope for survival!

89
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,580
Gedatsu-sama! No! I'm not the one you're--!

90
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,710
He can't get it off!

91
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,380
I see! It is a cloud! If you try to lift it,
your hands will just go through!

92
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,350
The more you struggle to get it off,
the deeper you're dragged inside...

93
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,400
I have to help him!

94
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,230
There you are, raccoon dog!

95
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,230
Swamp Cloud Burger!

96
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,450
Yikes! If one of those hits me, I'm dead!

97
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,240
Hey! Are you all right?! Hang in there!

98
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,630
Hey!

99
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,270
Breathe!

100
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,470
Don't die!

101
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,260
Thank goodness! You're alive!

102
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,690
I owe you my life...

103
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,600
Being saved by an enemy... Pathetic!

104
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,610
Uh oh!

105
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,570
And you call yourself one of the 50
Skypiean Divine Soldiers who serve God?!

106
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,570
How dare you speak that way?!
You'll pay! I'll never serve you again!

107
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,520
I'll make you prey for my Axe Dial!

108
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,960
Alright! We can do it! Let's fight together!

109
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,720
Hey, you! You don't scare us!

110
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,440
Very well. Jet Punch!

111
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,280
The destructive Jet Dial!

112
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,360
If you accelerate your punch with it,

113
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,030
your opponent doesn't even
have time to feel his own defeat.

114
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,750
Though the fact that it
rips clothing is a problem...

115
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,650
This is a priest?!

116
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,380
I have to run with
everything I've got... or I'll die!

117
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,990
No, stay off the clouds!
There are Swamp Cloud traps!

118
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,230
I gotta go on top of the ruins
and into the forest!

119
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,820
Where do you think you're going, raccoon dog?

120
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,280
Jet Punch!

121
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,950
Rumble! Jumping Point!

122
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,810
Rumble Balls last for three minutes!

123
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,550
If I don't escape within
three minutes, I will be killed!

124
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,370
So you have Zoan-type powers!

125
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,010
It's no use! Jet Punch!

126
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,510
Heavy Point!

127
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,350
Swamp Cloud Burger!

128
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,940
It's that!

129
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,940
Guard Point!

130
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,060
You insolent little...!

131
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,060
Brain Point!

132
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,990
Scope!

133
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,770
A weak point! Some sort of weak point!

134
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,320
Anything at all! I gotta find
an opening and escape!

135
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,080
Jet Punch!

136
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,890
I even had my guard up...

137
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,170
What do you think this place is?!
Don't destroy the ruins!

138
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,310
Why don't you worry about yourself
instead of some ruins, Missy?

139
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,550
Punch Mountain!

140
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,440
Oh, no!

141
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,420
You simpleton...

142
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,390
How far does this cave go?

143
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,500
I can't find any exits,
no matter how much I walk...

144
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,680
Man, I'm hungry...

145
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,710
But I don't see anything edible at all...

146
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,680
I wonder what Chopper and
the rest are up to right now...

147
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,090
Are they actually heading
for the city of gold?

148
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,380
His feet...

149
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,400
I see... a weak spot...

150
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,890
Walk Point!

151
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,640
Can I escape? I can't see straight...

152
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,980
You can still move?

153
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,260
My legs are unsteady... And the
Rumble Ball is about to wear off...

154
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,010
Yes. It's time to stop running...

155
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,120
You can beat him!

156
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,500
You little...! What do
you think you're doing?!

157
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,710
Swamp Cloud Burger!

158
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,880
Everyone protects me
because I always run away!

159
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,520
That's why they don't rely on me!

160
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,770
I'm going to raise a pirate flag right here!

161
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,120
Sore loser. Even the air is my realm!
Do you still not get it?!

162
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,350
Come!

163
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,550
Oh! He removed my shoe just now!

164
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,050
Damn you and your insolence, raccoon dog!

165
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,520
I'm a monster! I'm strong!

166
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,730
The weakest beasts howl the most!

167
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,580
Jet Punch!

168
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,690
I lost my composure and control of my Mantra!

169
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,350
He grazed me! That was close!

170
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,050
Arm Point!

171
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,420
I'm alive!

172
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,380
Cloven...

173
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,050
...Cross!

174
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,290
Now I'm a pirate, too!

175
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,130
It looks like he fell right into
a swamp! Thank goodness!

176
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,670
Don't come back up! Please,
just keep sinking!

177
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,110
He's moving!

178
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,280
He's still alive...!

179
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,830
H-How stupid of me! I can't believe
that raccoon dog overpowered me!

180
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,750
How careless of me! I'm sinking
into a swamp! I must escape!

181
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,260
Don't come back up!

182
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,880
Sink! Sink!

183
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,590
Escape! Milky Dial!

184
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,800
He really sank!

185
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,380
How careless of me!

186
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,720
Y-Yes! I beat him!

187
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,040
How careless of me!

188
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,250
Another of the priests' voices disappeared...

189
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,610
This is bad! I have to hurry to the others!

190
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,870
Huh? What's going on?!
A breakdown at a time like this?!

191
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,500
Come on, work! Work, you!

192
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,770
I can barely even ride
it, much less fix it...

193
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,470
H-Help!

194
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,090
Please! Stay away from me!

195
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,110
Father! Hurry!

196
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,710
I know! Hold on tight, Conis-san! Here we go!

197
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,350
Right!

198
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,670
Now, Conis-san!

199
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,200
Right!

200
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,860
Here! Grab my hand!

201
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,660
That was close...

202
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,930
You're safe now. You're
a Shandian child, right?

203
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,870
Don't be afraid. We're...

204
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,290
I'm not afraid!

205
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,520
I'm a warrior of Shandora!
I'm not afraid of you Skypieans!

206
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,050
Her name is Suu! I think she likes you!

207
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,900
Suu?

208
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,870
My name is Conis.

209
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,880
Hello, my name is Pagaya. I'm sorry.

210
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,460
What's your name?

211
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,880
I'm Aisa...

212
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,910
I know you just saved me, but I
want you to take me to Upper Yard.

213
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,420
Eh?!

214
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,070
Even as we speak, everyone's
voices disappear more and more...

215
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,000
It's the truth! I can hear voices,
even from far away...

216
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,660
All kinds of voices...

217
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,360
Actually, we're headed for Upper Yard, too.

218
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,130
Eh?!

219
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,610
We want to lead the Blue Sea people
in Upper Yard to the end of Skypiea.

220
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,490
You mean the guys on the ship?

221
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,900
Eh? Yes...

222
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,400
I think they're trying to
escape from the forest...

223
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,420
Do you know where their ship is?!

224
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,560
Yeah.

225
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,180
Father!

226
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,560
Yes. I'm sorry. Please lead us there.

227
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,130
A-Alright.

228
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,940
I'm finally a pirate! I think I'll look
for the gold instead of the others!

229
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,850
I'm going to surprise them all!

230
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,120
That seems suspicious to me...

231
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,910
Who knows? Maybe everyone
is already up there...

232
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,800
Racing full speed ahead as always

233
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,550
A to Z, we run through it

234
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,350
We all have worries and fall many times

235
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,270
But we just need to rise to the top someday

236
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:31,740
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

237
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:39,800
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

238
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,300
I never treat you "bad"

239
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,000
How many times did we fall?

240
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:55,090
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

241
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,630
Smile! Come back to you, friends

242
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,440
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

243
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,360
Come back to you, friends

244
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,200
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

245
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,900
Come back to you, friends

246
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,190
Whew, I'm hungry!

247
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,380
Are there any yakiniku shops? I guess not.

248
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,960
Are you all right? You've been
shaking for a while now.

249
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,430
I've never felt this afraid before.

250
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,670
Everyone's voices are
disappearing more and more...

251
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,080
On the next episode of One Piece!

252
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,350
"Unbeatable Powers!
Eneru's True Form is Revealed"

253
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,570
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
