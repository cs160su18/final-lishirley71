2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
saa yukou

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
So let's go

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Without stopping

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll keep getting back up

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
shinjita sono saki e to...

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,350
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,590
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,690
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,610
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,660
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,520
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,460
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,720
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,200
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ
to rescue his brother, Ace!

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,080
Meanwhile, at the Navy HQ,
with Ace's execution at hand,

64
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,560
the Whitebeard Pirates suddenly appear!

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,970
You better tell me that my beloved son...

66
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,880
...is all right.

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,750
Pops!

68
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,350
Finally, the war has begun!

69
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,600
I can hear the ground rumbling!

70
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,780
Now it's coming!

71
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,310
The seaquake that he set up before!

72
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,220
Coming in the form of a tsunami!

73
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,470
It's a tsunami!

74
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,400
Ice Age!

75
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,340
What? Do you wanna fight?

76
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,000
I just want to figure
out the true distance...

77
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,300
...between us and that man who
seems like right in front of us.

78
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,770
"An All-Consuming Inferno!!
Admiral Akainu's Power!"

79
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,870
Oh no!

80
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,960
Run!

81
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,840
Pops!

82
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,340
He deflected the blow of
the world's greatest swordsman!

83
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,410
H-H-He must be...!

84
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,300
...3rd division commander--Diamond Jozu!

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
You better keep your wits about you!

86
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,890
Guys! Let's keep advancing!

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,650
Fight them back!

88
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,560
What fools!

89
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,250
They want to break through from the front!

90
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,010
Artillery unit!

91
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,150
Fire at the enemy ships
and approaching pirates!

92
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,370
Yes, sir!

93
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,780
Forward units, don't allow
them access to this plaza!

94
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,910
Yes, sir!

95
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,270
Oh boy...

96
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,780
The commanders of the Whitebeards
are true to their reputation.

97
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,350
They are all pretty much like monsters.

98
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,970
To finish this with minimum damage,

99
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,550
we just have to cut off
their head nice and quick.

100
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,670
I-It's bright!

101
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,980
Wh-What is it?!

102
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,530
I-It's Kizaru!

103
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,550
Yasakani Sacred Jewel!

104
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,700
Hey, that's so bright.

105
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,060
He warded off the admiral's attack!

106
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,120
What's that?

107
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,320
He's engulfed in a blue flame!

108
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,950
Blue flame?

109
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,750
You can't reach...

110
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,510
...the king...

111
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,800
...so easily!

112
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,590
So fearsome, these Whitebeard Pirates.

113
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,220
What's with his body?!

114
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,890
He took Kizaru-san's attack
directly but didn't fall!

115
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,060
So he has this power as they say?!

116
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,190
It's even rarer than Logia.

117
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,520
Zoan type--Mythical Creature.

118
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,200
Look! His wounds are disappearing!

119
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,740
I-I can't believe it! It didn't hurt him?!

120
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,410
It did.

121
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,890
Don't lie.

122
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,440
So he's the 1st division commander...

123
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,810
No matter what kind of attack he absorbs,
he recovers by flames...

124
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,200
Marco the Phoenix!

125
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,680
I have never seen a bird like that.

126
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,100
How painful.

127
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,670
Don't lie!

128
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,360
Kizaru-san got blown away!

129
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,750
I can't believe it! Kizaru-san!

130
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,330
I knew that you wouldn't let me...

131
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,050
...strike your head that easily.

132
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,650
Giant unit, you better pay
attention to the sky, too.

133
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,200
Yes, sir!

134
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,400
Here come the giants!

135
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,200
Attack their feet! Let's topple them!

136
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,920
All of you! Stand back!

137
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Jozu!

138
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,590
What power!

139
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,650
Withdraw for now!

140
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,330
What is he doing?!

141
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,840
Stop this if you can!

142
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,050
It's a block of ice!

143
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,690
It's gigantic!

144
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,420
Damn! Those two...

145
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,150
They shouldn't leave their
positions like that.

146
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,840
If all three of us left our positions...

147
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,460
...who would cover them?!

148
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,220
Akainu-san!

149
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,790
Great Eruption!

150
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,760
That gigantic block of ice disappeared...

151
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,190
...into thin air!

152
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,010
No...

153
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,930
Get away!

154
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,330
Volcanic rocks!

155
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,490
Too many of them!

156
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,990
Dammit!

157
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,720
One of our ships has been hit!

158
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,940
Get away from the ship!

159
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,320
This is like watching the end of the world!

160
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,210
He lit up the place too brightly.

161
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,600
Why don't you light up birthday
cakes instead, you magma squirt!

162
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,400
Don't you want an illuminated
funeral for yourself, Whitebeard?

163
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,420
There're 3 more!

164
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,780
Keep firing! Don't fall back!

165
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,030
Don't be afraid!

166
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,540
Get to the plaza!

167
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,540
Stop the commanders!

168
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,970
Don't let them get ashore!

169
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,610
Sink the Moby Dick and kill Whitebeard!

170
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,050
Th-Th-They are pirates...

171
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,710
And this is a real battlefield!

172
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,130
Oh no!

173
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,430
I feel weak at the knees
and I can barely move!

174
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,990
It's impossible...

175
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,680
We have nothing on these guys!

176
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Don't you think so?

177
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,620
They are all monsters.

178
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,080
There's no role to play
for fledglings like us!

179
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,880
Let's get away from here. Okay?

180
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,770
Okay?

181
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,290
But...

182
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,220
Are you nuts?

183
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,270
If we try to fight this battle,

184
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,670
we won't last even a second
and you know that!

185
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,730
Don't you wanna become an admiral?!

186
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,480
I'll become a Navy...

187
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,610
...ad...

188
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,270
...admiral someday!

189
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,970
You wanna fight me, right?

190
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,110
Then, of course you have to
become a big deal like that!

191
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,720
D-Don't take this the wrong way!

192
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,800
That's why, that's why...

193
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,050
...neither of us can die here!

194
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,600
Our place to die is still far away!

195
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,000
But I promised Luffy-san so...

196
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,650
Wh-What is it this time?!

197
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,620
Here he comes!

198
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,150
Get him! Get him!

199
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,050
Break the artillery defense
of the Navy ships!

200
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,520
Ace-kun!

201
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,190
Nice! Get them!

202
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,240
Little Oars Jr.!

203
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,990
He must be a descendent of
the Continent Puller Oars.

204
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,770
He's big!

205
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,790
He's way bigger than common Giants!

206
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,270
Don't let him invade the island!

207
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,420
It'll give them the advantage!

208
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,400
I didn't know that the descendant
of Oars was allied with Whitebeard!

209
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,460
I want it!

210
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,850
I want his dead body!

211
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,480
He makes me tingle!

212
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,400
Oars!

213
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,960
Ace-kun is a nice person!

214
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,600
I won't let him...

215
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,890
...die!

216
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,800
In the past, the Straw Hats suffered
at the hands of the beast, Oars.

217
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,430
Now, to save Ace, an ally
of the Whitebeard Pirates,

218
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,320
the descendant of Oars
breaks through to the bay.

219
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,450
How will the Navy deal with
an attacker whose power

220
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,770
overwhelms even the Giants?!

221
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

222
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,240
"A Descendent of the Beast!
Little Oars Jr.--Full Speed Ahead!"

223
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
