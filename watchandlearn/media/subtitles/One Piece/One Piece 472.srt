2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
To the future I believe in...

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,350
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,590
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,690
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,610
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,660
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,520
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,460
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,560
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,950
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,170
Inside the bay, the Whitebeards
are trying to get to the scaffold

64
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,570
but the Navy stands in their way.

65
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,770
And at the bay head,
the Pacifistas began to attack

66
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,360
the allies of the Whitebeards
to exterminate them!

67
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,380
Squard!

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm glad that you're alive!

69
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,250
Yeah, barely.

70
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,550
I see. I was calling for you a while ago.

71
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,060
How is it at the bay head now?

72
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,650
Your allies were beaten badly.

73
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,760
I made it here because
I found the way out luckily.

74
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,450
Sengoku has no mercy.

75
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,560
He's using all the forces he has
in order to defeat us.

76
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,380
Pops, did you notice what the Navy was up to?

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,550
I've known Sengoku for a long time.

78
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,960
Squard? Why is he up there?

79
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,370
There are 43 allied captains here

80
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,110
and we are all in your debt beyond words!

81
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,470
We risk our lives for the Whitebeard Pirates!

82
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,100
"Akainu's Plot!
Whitebeard Entrapped!"

83
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,530
L-Look! Whitebeard has...

84
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,390
Whitebeard has...

85
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,650
Whitebeard has...

86
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,470
Whitebeard has been stabbed!

87
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,460
Old man!

88
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,460
Wh-Who stabbed him?!

89
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,380
I think he is...!

90
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,040
Yes! But the man who did it is a
captain from among the allies...

91
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,340
...from the New World - Whirl Spider...

92
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,040
Squard!

93
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,960
Why did you do that?! Answer me, Squard!

94
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,710
S-Shut up! You guys made me do it!

95
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,170
What do you mean?!

96
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,560
Do you know what you've done...?

97
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,890
Pops! Don't push yourself! Your health is...

98
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,110
Old buddy!

99
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,580
Stop perpetrating this farce, Whitebeard!

100
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,980
I know about your deal with the Navy!

101
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,170
You have their assurance that the
Whitebeards and Ace will remain safe!

102
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,680
What is he talking about?

103
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,830
What's going on here?!

104
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,380
Everyone, listen very closely!

105
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
We've all been trapped!

106
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,680
You never told me...

107
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,820
...that Ace was a son of
that hateful Gold Roger!

108
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,700
When you first found me, I was all alone...

109
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,220
Squard is out of control again!

110
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,860
He's dangerous! Stay away!

111
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,520
Again?! Please!

112
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,730
We can't do anything
about it  when it starts!

113
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,570
Isn't there any strong man?!

114
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,810
Hey! Bring it on!

115
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,550
Bring Gold Roger here!

116
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,500
What? Are you all scared?

117
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,480
What are you waiting for, guys?

118
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,510
You know why I was all alone.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,180
Because Roger killed all my precious crew
who had fought alongside me for so long.

120
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,590
I despise Roger and...

121
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,480
...you know it!!

122
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,520
Then you should have told me
that Ace was Roger's son

123
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,940
and you want to make him
the next King of the Pirates!

124
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,420
Don't mind the Whitebeards!

125
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,720
Back down to the plaza immediately!

126
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,530
The old man wants Ace to be the King?

127
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,260
Whitebeard is the greatest pirate I know.

128
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,940
I wanna help him to be King of the Pirates...

129
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,780
You were already betraying me at that time!

130
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,610
But I didn't know. I even befriended Ace!

131
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,020
I must've looked so stupid!

132
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,510
And then, your dearest son Ace got caught!

133
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,000
With the Whitebeard Pirates
all inside the bay

134
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,900
and we allied pirates on the outside.

135
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,530
You have sold the 43 captains
of the allied pirates to the Navy...

136
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,830
...in exchange for Ace's life!

137
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,840
The allied pirates will be vanquished

138
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,420
and the Whitebeards and Ace will be safe.

139
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,900
That's your deal with Sengoku, isn't it?!

140
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,540
Ace is Roger's son?!

141
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,940
Yes and our superiors have an agreement
over how they're gonna end this war.

142
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,350
That's a lie! I can't believe that crap!

143
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,330
Whether you like or not,
there's only one truth

144
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,110
and you all will die in vain.

145
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,280
Silence! I won't fall for your line!

146
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,410
Can't you see it?

147
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,530
Soon you will know that I'm not lying.

148
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,880
Look closely and see
the outcome for yourself!

149
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,580
Our converging attack will start soon

150
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,880
and only you--the allied
pirates--will be attacked.

151
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,500
The Navy won't even touch
the Whitebeard Pirates.

152
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,630
We didn't know anything about it

153
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,860
and we followed you here sacrificing
our lives to save Ace and help you

154
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,980
and this is what happens!

155
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,820
In fact, we're the ones who
have been attacked by the Navy!

156
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,890
Those monsters approach from the back
and the ice is blocking us on both sides

157
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,030
and we have no way out now!

158
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,610
Big buggy, is he telling the truth?!

159
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,360
Say that he's lying, old buddy!

160
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,340
It's a miracle that I could stab you once.

161
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,880
I'm prepared for it! Kill me!

162
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,050
The wall of ice is blocking us!
There's no place to go!

163
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,060
Is this it?!

164
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,100
When I come to think of it,
they're attacking just us!

165
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,980
Run!

166
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,580
Old buddy, did you really trade us...

167
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,200
...For Ace's life?!

168
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,420
Please say something, old buddy!

169
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,120
Old buddy!

170
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,190
Old buddy!

171
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,410
It can't be true!

172
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,730
Whitebeard wouldn't sell out to the Navy.

173
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,060
He sold his allies?

174
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,120
No way, Whitebeard wouldn't do that!

175
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,960
Whitebeard and the Navy made a deal?

176
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,150
Then the pirates who trusted
and followed Whitebeard...

177
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,130
...Are betrayed and will
be killed by the Navy?!

178
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,270
I didn't wanna believe it,
I couldn't believe it!

179
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,100
I never thought that
old buddy would betray us!

180
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,130
You fool!

181
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,230
You've been deceived, Squard!
Why couldn't you trust Pops?!

182
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,690
Don't play innocent, Marco!

183
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,340
You're the 1st division commander,

184
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,030
I know that you knew about Ace
and the deal with the Navy!

185
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,990
It's true that Ace is Roger's son.

186
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,150
They used that to their advantage,

187
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,960
tricking the one man who would
be most angered by that fact.

188
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,630
Their strategy was a notch above us.

189
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,050
I don't want any delay. Aokiji!

190
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,020
He's coming towards us?!

191
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,330
This war was a setup?!

192
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,470
Everything up to now meant nothing?!

193
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,650
There'll be no win or lose?!

194
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,570
Turned off!

195
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,580
What's wrong?

196
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,870
Is it broken?

197
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,690
Activate the encircling walls!

198
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,140
That bastard!

199
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,800
How could he let his own
allies stab him that easily?

200
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,290
Shame on you, Whitebeard!

201
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,720
I've no recollection of being
beaten by such a weakling!

202
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,240
Croco boy...

203
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,020
Crocodile.

204
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,360
It's true,

205
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,920
he could've fended off that attack
if he was the same guy he used to be.

206
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,040
Even if it was a surprise attack or
the attacker was one of his fellows,

207
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,850
he could've avoid it!

208
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,720
That's the problem!

209
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,150
Are you telling me to draw their
sympathy by putting these on?

210
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,270
Pops!

211
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,940
He allows himself to get out of shape!

212
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,120
You know what you have done, right, Squard?

213
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,640
You thrust a sword into your father's body.

214
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,340
You're such a stupid son!

215
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,570
But I love you, son, even if you are a fool.

216
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,460
Cut the crap...

217
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,850
You sold our lives to...

218
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,920
Who pulled your upright and
loyal heart into the darkness?

219
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,550
Tell me.

220
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,850
He's an insurgent in the Navy.

221
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,080
I'm opposed to this plan.

222
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,060
People who don't know the truth

223
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:04,000
are calling him a legendary
pirate and honoring him

224
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,710
but that's not true.

225
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,930
He's just a scumbag who
offered a secret deal to the Navy

226
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,690
just to protect his own interests

227
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,370
and betrays and sells out his allies.

228
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,820
They made up all his legends.

229
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,580
The one that we have to
kill in this war is Whitebeard!

230
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,730
It's absolutely unthinkable not to!

231
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,660
If you're gonna help me,
I'll save you all--the allied pirates.

232
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,730
Stab Whitebeard.

233
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,700
He said he would save us
allied pirates if I slew you.

234
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,750
So that's what Akainu told you.

235
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,630
I know how much you hate Roger...

236
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,630
...so much so that I can feel your pain.

237
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,650
But, Squard,

238
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,480
it's ridiculous to lay the blame on
a child for the sins of his father.

239
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,430
Did Ace do something to you?

240
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:10,670
You and Ace have weathered
agony, joy and pain together...

241
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,170
...so many times along with
the others, isn't it right?

242
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,130
I don't give a damn who Ace's father is.

243
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,750
We all met each other
on this wide sea by chance!

244
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,450
Not only the two of you but
all of you, I take as my sons!

245
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,010
So, Squard, treat him kindly.

246
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,960
I don't love him any more than any other.

247
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,660
You are all family to me!

248
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,860
Anyway...

249
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,630
...he has never...

250
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,630
...changed at all, Sengoku.

251
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,850
He shook us up very well.

252
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,540
How ridiculous to say that I sold my sons!

253
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,710
He gave the pirates the way out.

254
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,310
I should never underestimate that guy.

255
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,070
The wall of ice has broken down.

256
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,360
This Navy ship is in good condition!

257
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,830
We can get away at any time!

258
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,180
If you are a pirate, you pick what
you want to believe on your own!

259
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,660
I knew that it was a lie!
That was the Navy's plan!

260
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,560
Damn! They fooled us!

261
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,980
Old buddy would never betray us!

262
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm sorry! I will never lose
trust in you, old buddy!

263
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,000
Me too, old buddy! I'm so sorry!

264
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,080
I'll follow you to the end!

265
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,250
Old buddy!

266
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,110
Did you call me a weakling?
Please, Croco brat.

267
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,250
I'm just a human with one heart.

268
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,530
People would call me a devil or a monster

269
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,350
but I can't continue to
be the strongest forever.

270
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,090
If I can save this one young man's life,

271
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,970
I will earn my right to
retire from the world.

272
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,260
Those of you who'll follow me,
lay down your life for it!

273
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,150
Be ready! He's gonna run wild!

274
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,600
He's the strongest man in the world!

275
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,930
Let's go!!

276
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,620
The world's strongest pirate, Whitebeard,
has joined the battle himself.

277
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,040
Unleashing his Tremor-Tremor
fruit powers to the max,

278
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,810
he decimates the Navy's
forces one after another.

279
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,560
In response, Sengoku finally enacts
the greatest counterattack plan

280
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
in Navy history!

281
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,130
On the next episode of One Piece!

282
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,870
"The Encircling Walls Activated!
The Whitebeard Pirates backed into a corner!"

283
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,080
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
