2
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,660
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,420
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,190
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,040
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,340
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,990
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,860
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

14
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,350
the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,280
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,570
an island with two parts,
one burning, the other frozen.

17
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,950
After learning about the ruler of
the island - Caesar Clown's motive,

18
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,040
and all while trying to escape Shinokuni,

19
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,290
along with their pirate ally -

20
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,260
the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

21
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,830
they are on the move to kidnap Caesar,

22
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,820
save the children,

23
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,510
and escape from the island.

24
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,470
After falling into a garbage dump,

25
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,110
Luffy met a dragon named Momonosuke -

26
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,180
who has the same name as the boy that
the samurai Kin'emon was looking for.

27
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Wh-What?!

28
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,850
Hey, wait!

29
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,940
We're... flying!

30
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,860
Wait, Mocha!

31
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,610
Don't do that.

32
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,530
Robin!

33
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,890
Oh!

34
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,270
You're Pirate Hunter Zoro

35
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,340
with a 120 million berry bounty!

36
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,760
She's a Logia-type.

37
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,700
I'll take care of her!

38
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,010
"A Deadly Fight in a Blizzard!
The Straw Hats vs. the Snow Woman!"

39
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,740
B BUILDING 3RD FLOOR - THE BISCUIT ROOM

40
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,190
Robin! Are you okay?

41
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,960
Yes,

42
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
it's just a scratch.

43
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,930
We must stop the children quickly.

44
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,600
Yeah.

45
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,610
Nami, please hurry!

46
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,680
The kids are gonna
leave the room soon!

47
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,230
Wait, Mocha!

48
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,210
I promised her that I will hold them

49
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,400
but I couldn't

50
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,650
and I put Mocha in danger!

51
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,310
Stop!

52
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,160
Give us the candy!

53
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,530
You can't have it!

54
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,790
Chopper-chan told me
what these candies do to us!

55
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,000
It's not fair!

56
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,260
Wait, Mocha! Give us the candy!

57
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,460
You shouldn't eat these candies!

58
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,140
Come to your senses, everybody!

59
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,700
Mocha, we have no choice.

60
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,070
We are sick.

61
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,700
Mommy!

62
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,360
Daddy!

63
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,080
They said we couldn't
see our parents now.

64
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,210
If adults get infected with the
disease we have, they'll die.

65
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,980
You don't want your mother
and father die, do you?

66
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,690
Let's get good treatment
for a year and get better!

67
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,650
Uh-huh!

68
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,720
I'm glad that you made it!

69
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,220
Good to see you!

70
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,630
My name is Caesar Clown.

71
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,330
Call me "Master."

72
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,610
You two are a part of my
first-generation of patients.

73
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,090
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

74
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,480
I bet you were scared and worried

75
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,220
when you heard
that you're sick out of the blue.

76
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,060
But everything is okay now.

77
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,090
You don't have to worry about anything.

78
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,650
I will treat you at any cost!

79
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,240
To tell you the truth,

80
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,510
I lost my only son to this disease.

81
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,450
I never wanna see another
child suffering from it!

82
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,480
Also, I don't wanna see another parent

83
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,980
lose their child and have to grieve like me!

84
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,920
Oh, I'm so sorry.

85
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,760
How embarrassing.
I shouldn't cry in front of you.

86
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,850
Are you okay, Master-san?

87
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,500
Thank you. You're very kind.

88
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,480
Oh yes! I must introduce you to them!

89
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,520
They're from other islands
but have the same disease.

90
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,880
Mocha!

91
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,280
Wait!

92
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm Uzu. Nice to meet you!

93
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,660
Candy!

94
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,950
I'm Doran.

95
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,420
Wait! Mocha!

96
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,540
I'm Konbu.

97
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,960
Give me the candy!

98
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,690
We have some new friends here!

99
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,910
Teach them about this place, okay?

100
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,480
Okay!

101
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,170
Let's play over there!

102
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,280
Let's play!

103
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,620
Go ahead!

104
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,410
Uh-huh!

105
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,000
Everybody! Be nice to each other!

106
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,340
Let me know if you need any help!

107
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,130
Okay, Monet-san!

108
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,410
Monet-san was kind
but she was lying!

109
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,600
It was all lies!

110
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,510
This is a reward for
enduring with the treatment.

111
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,220
It's a candy from the Master.

112
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,820
Let's escape from here together!

113
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,200
Please!

114
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,700
Come to your senses now!

115
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,240
We gotta catch up with the children!

116
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,130
Yeah!

117
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,480
Where did she go?!

118
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,980
Hey you!

119
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,090
What are you doing?!

120
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,280
What?! Wait a sec!

121
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,240
Why is he coming this way?!

122
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,780
Wait, Nami! No!

123
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,120
You can't use me as a shield!

124
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,210
What a shame.

125
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,960
Why are you trying
to attack the weak ones?

126
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,670
It's strategic to finish off
easier foes first.

127
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,890
Zoro, move out of my way!

128
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,910
Heat Egg!

129
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,740
The heat worked, just as I thought!

130
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,460
Don't come after us!

131
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,410
Stay away!

132
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,890
Cat Burglar -

133
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,260
a 16 million berry bounty.

134
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,390
She hid herself in the snow again!

135
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,390
Don't you wanna fight me,
snow woman?!

136
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,140
The exit is...

137
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,820
Oh no!

138
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,960
Snow Fence!

139
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,200
Perpetual Snow!

140
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,500
Nami?!

141
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,900
The snow is...

142
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,630
It's cold! I can't move!

143
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,530
Nami!

144
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,970
She did it again!

145
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,350
Watch out, Chopper!

146
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,930
Cuatro Mano!

147
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,820
Spank!

148
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,530
Nami!

149
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,780
I was scared!

150
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,060
Robin! Thank you!

151
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,470
Oh please.

152
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,310
Those children are the Master's
precious test subjects.

153
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,510
And I'm responsible for protecting
Caesar and his experiment.

154
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,810
Who planted this rebellious
spirit in Mocha's mind?

155
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,690
What?!

156
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,460
Those kids asked for help on their own!

157
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,160
Move out of my way!

158
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,380
You go ahead!

159
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,240
We'd better hurry!

160
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,970
Uh-huh!

161
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,550
Mocha, please hang on!

162
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,020
You people are so uncool.

163
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,230
Every single day, we treat them nicely

164
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,730
and allow them to live in great comfort.

165
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,740
What you people are trying to do is

166
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,190
take away these "treasures"
from us "foster parents."

167
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,210
You people are like pirates.

168
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,630
So you have no problem with it, right?

169
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,090
I said it's uncool.

170
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,260
Stop interfering with my duty!

171
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,920
Sword Snow!

172
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,640
Skin Sword!

173
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,710
Great! We can get out of here like this!

174
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,810
Wh-What?!
What's the matter?!

175
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,910
I'm not hungry at all...

176
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,300
I'm not...

177
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,710
What is Monet doing?

178
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,110
The children are getting away!

179
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,520
But who cares?

180
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,450
We can always restock
guinea pigs through kidnapping.

181
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,890
Our priority now is providing
a showcase for Shinokuni

182
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,550
and getting rid of the Straw Hats.

183
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,990
Because the gas is
flowing into the building,

184
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,650
the situation is favorable for us.

185
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,400
B Building will be

186
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,660
filled up with gas soon.

187
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,840
They have no choice
but to head to R Building.

188
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,290
They're gonna be killed
by the gas anyway though.

189
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,010
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no...

190
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,540
Oh no! Oh no!

191
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,710
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

192
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,930
It's coming again!

193
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,870
How did the gas flow in?!

194
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,440
I thought the door was closed!

195
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,220
Is it leaking from somewhere?

196
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,320
Really?!

197
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,710
If so, this building is no longer safe!

198
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,270
We have no time!

199
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,020
Let's split up to look for the
Sea Prism Stone Handcuffs!

200
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,150
Again?!

201
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,030
But I guess we have no choice.

202
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,820
Brook, you go with Kin'emon!

203
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,830
We can't leave him alone -
he's too clumsy!

204
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,180
Alright!

205
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,120
Corpse-dono, thank you!

206
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,250
See you at R Building!

207
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,430
Okay!

208
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,640
You've been only defending yourself

209
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,270
without even trying to attack. Why is it?

210
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,780
Could it be what I think it is?

211
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,910
To be honest, I didn't think
I could beat you but...

212
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,200
...maybe I can.

213
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,200
There's another room!

214
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,110
Find the children and
take them out of here!

215
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,790
Hey, isn't it a little cold here?

216
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,750
The Navy?

217
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,340
Let's go through the door!

218
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,590
Yeah!

219
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,930
Everybody's trying to take
the children away from us!

220
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,020
I won't allow it!

221
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,020
Let's go!

222
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,570
Charge!

223
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,150
Why are you leading them?!

224
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Brother! I don't see any children

225
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,410
but there's Pirate Hunter Zoro!

226
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,490
He's such a pain.

227
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,750
Alright, guys!

228
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,800
Stick out your lower lip
and make fun of him!

229
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,720
I hope they all slip on the snow,
hit their heads and die.

230
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,690
Hey, Nami and Robin went ahead.

231
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,220
Just go away already.

232
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,980
Oh! What good information
even from a fool!

233
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,880
Alright, let's go, guys...

234
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,070
But there's a cutie behind him!

235
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,110
Oh! She's so cute!

236
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,290
You people are so obnoxious!

237
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,500
Just go already!

238
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,080
Hey. But look!

239
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,930
Her appearance.

240
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,430
She's not a human.

241
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,810
A bird with a human face?

242
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,290
She's a harpy!

243
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,460
What?!

244
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,630
B-But...

245
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,490
...she's still cute!

246
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,300
Rather bewitchingly beautiful!

247
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,060
Yeah, so sexy!

248
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,120
You're enjoying this, aren't you?!

249
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,940
Hey, why is it snowing in here?

250
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,540
Oh yeah.

251
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,880
It's because of me.

252
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,210
It's getting stormy
all of a sudden!

253
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,030
No matter who you are,

254
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,820
I'm not gonna let anybody

255
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,970
take the children!

256
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,300
She's gone!

257
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,630
Where did she go?!

258
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,280
Hey! Are you alright?!

259
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,250
Wh-What happened to my shoulder?!

260
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,920
You bastard!

261
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,060
Sh-She's a Logia-type!

262
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,330
That bitch!

263
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,220
Damn!

264
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,860
A swordsman using Haki?!

265
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,710
Captain-chan!

266
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,690
We sealed off the door to the room
to prevent the gas from flowing in.

267
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,900
But we don't know

268
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,660
where it might start leaking again.

269
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,120
There's not much time!

270
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,080
Everybody, do all you can
to save the children!

271
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
What about you?

272
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,830
I'm gonna stay here!

273
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,660
What?!

274
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,480
What are you thinking?

275
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,830
I think you need my help here!

276
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,470
What?!

277
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,970
Monet attacks, using the powerful
Snow-Snow Fruit powers,

278
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,090
and Tashigi desperately fights
back by using her Haki.

279
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,150
But she is then caught by
Monet's monstrous fangs,

280
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,940
and just as her shoulder is
about to be torn to shreds,

281
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,060
Zoro's beast-like instincts cause him into action.

282
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

283
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,650
"Showing Off His Techniques!
Zoro's Formidable One-Sword Style!"

284
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
