00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,310
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,570
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,030
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,950
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after Shirahoshi,
are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,460
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:00,380
Then, two people rose up on the Fish-Man Island,
to change our hopeless history.

81
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,130
One was Queen Otohime.

82
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,350
And the other is the hero who
freed the slaves - Fisher Tiger.

83
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,110
Let's talk. They were two
monumental figures!

84
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,150
But what was their hidden angst?!

85
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:28,990
"A Hero Who Freed the Slaves!
An Adventurer Tiger!"

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm going to tell you about...

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,920
...an incident that made Arlong
rampage through the East Blue.

88
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,680
I want you especially to know about this.

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,560
Alright.

90
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,780
It all began...

91
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,610
...16 years ago.

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,410
16 YEARS AGO - THE FISH-MAN ISLAND

93
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,540
Outta my way!

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,830
Thief!

95
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,830
Somebody, catch him!

96
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,800
He stole a lot of money!

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,840
Hey, outta my way!

98
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,600
I-If anyone comes close, you won't
wanna see what I'll do with this girl!

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,390
Your Majesty?

100
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,480
Oh, Your Majesty! Wait!

101
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,690
Don't get involved with such a thing!

102
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,150
That's our responsibility!

103
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,910
--Wait!
--Queen Otohime!

104
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,780
Who is that?!

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,580
Stay away! Or I'll shoot you!

106
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,630
I-I warned you!

107
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,090
Did I miss?

108
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,260
Dammit! Stay away!

109
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,560
I got you!

110
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,620
KING NEPTUNE'S WIFE
QUEEN OTOHIME (GOLDFISH MERMAID)

111
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,040
It's... Otohime-sama!

112
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
--Ouch!
--Really?!

113
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,590
--My hand!
--Doctor!

114
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,800
Your Highness! Let me see it!

115
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,970
It's a compound fracture.

116
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,430
With one hit?!

117
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,180
I don't mind!

118
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,890
Queen Otohime!

119
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,400
Queen?

120
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,530
Why have you done such a senseless
thing as robbing someone?!

121
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,570
Shut up! You're from a wealthy,
royal family - you don't understand!

122
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,700
I have 10 kids at home,
who are crying from hunger!

123
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,330
All the more reason to not do it!

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,920
Q-Queen-sama! Stop hitting him!

125
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,670
You're far more fragile than all of us!

126
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,430
I don't care! I have to do this for him!

127
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,310
I have to teach him even if it
shatters my hand into pieces!

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Would your children be happy
being raised by stolen money?!

129
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,780
Live a life of which your
children can be proud!

130
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,290
However...

131
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,920
I have to... apologize, as well!

132
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,470
I'm sorry!

133
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,220
I didn't notice your struggles

134
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,730
even though I'm your queen and
I'm living in the same country!

135
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,030
Your worries and your pain are killing me!

136
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,620
You must have had some awful
reason to do what you did...

137
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,790
I didn't want to do it!

138
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,080
But I had no choice!

139
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,420
My store burned down.
Somebody set fire to it and stole all my money!

140
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,300
I lost my job and my debts were increasing.
And my poor kids were starving!

141
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,100
So that's why you did it. I understand...
I understand how you feel...

142
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,440
--But you can't do that!
--What?!

143
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,150
If you do the same thing to others,
it will never stop!

144
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,360
I'm sorry!

145
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,990
But I'm sorry! We are guilty
of not being dependable...

146
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,250
That's very generous...
That's very generous of you to say...

147
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,670
But you can't do that!

148
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,670
I'm sorry!

149
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,460
But you can't!

150
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,130
I will change my life!

151
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,340
Thank you for crying for a
good-for-nothing like me, Queen-sama!

152
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,560
Don't mention it. Good luck!

153
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,890
It's already unusual for someone from
the royal family to come out of the palace

154
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,810
and walk around...

155
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,150
But to slap a citizen and sob over his story!

156
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,570
Otohime-sama is a very
unconventional queen.

157
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,620
She's a woman of boundless compassion.
Look, even kids love her!

158
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,490
Otohime-sama!

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,950
Oh!

160
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,170
I will do my best for you children!

161
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,840
What?!

162
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,210
Your nose is running!
I hit you for your own good!

163
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,260
You look like a fool having
snot running out of one nostril.

164
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,260
It's better to have to come from both sides.

165
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,390
How touching!

166
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,810
Yeah?

167
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,900
She was so passionate and
full of love. Queen Otohime...

168
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,820
...went down to the island everyday
and addressed the nation.

169
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,870
We have to relocate the
Ryugu Kingdom on earth!

170
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,960
We have a different skin color.
We look different.

171
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,880
That's what humans say. And instead of waiting
for the day when they'll understand us,

172
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,590
we should move closer to
them to understand them!

173
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,390
The seafloor is 10,000 meters from the land.

174
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,850
That is also the distance
between our ways of thinking.

175
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,400
Don't get the wrong idea!

176
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,110
The humans who come to this island
are the kind called "pirates."

177
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,570
And the humans who buy people from
kidnappers are the Nobles who are in power.

178
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,580
We've only known the bad sort of humans.

179
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,450
We don't know anything about humans yet.

180
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,790
There are so many kind
humans on earth, I assume.

181
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,840
We should relocate the
kingdom under the same sun!

182
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:46,680
Let's express our intention to
relocate at the World Summit this year!

183
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,810
I need you all to sign here!

184
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,320
Well, even if it's Otohime-sama's idea...

185
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,780
The idea of moving closer
to humans is... Right?

186
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,830
Don't say that.

187
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,790
Let's take the first step
instead of doing nothing.

188
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,830
Well?

189
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,170
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,890
It's no use. History has proven it.

191
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,690
I'm home, kids!

192
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,160
Welcome home, mother-sama!

193
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,910
I'm home, Shirahoshi!

194
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,800
Oh, Shirahoshi, my consolation.
I'm sorry to be late.

195
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,350
Oh, your nose is running
but you're beautiful!

196
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,360
We were here with her so
she was safe, mother-sama!

197
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,020
She was safe, she was safe!

198
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,900
Thank you, my princes.

199
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,820
Mother-sama, is your hand okay?

200
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,950
It's nothing.

201
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,870
The future that you four will live in,

202
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,670
I will change it!

203
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,170
If Otohime-sama wants to make a speech,
she could do it by video.

204
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,800
Her strong Observation Haki by
nature makes her the way she is-jamon.

205
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,640
She prefers to face people to win their hearts
rather than speak from the palace above.

206
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,570
That's one of Otohime's guiding principles.
And not even I can stop her.

207
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,650
But there are a lot of human
pirates staying on the island.

208
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,530
She is protected by your friend, the pirate
- Whitebeard's influence to some extent...

209
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,910
but you never know what could happen!

210
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,040
She knows that, too.

211
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,790
The world that Otohime dreams about is...

212
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,720
...exactly the same as...

213
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,100
...what our ancestors dreamed about

214
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,310
but couldn't make come true
several hundred years ago-jamon.

215
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,390
What do you mean by that?

216
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,400
I can't stop Otohime.

217
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,280
Be sure to keep her safe!

218
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,190
Yes, sir!

219
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,660
Hey, fish girl!

220
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,660
--Yes?
--Stay here and serve us!

221
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,830
I'm sorry. We don't do that sort of thing.

222
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,500
Huh? Don't be such a snob!

223
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,840
You're just a Fish-Man!

224
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,480
What? Does anyone have something to say?

225
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,440
Shut your mouth!

226
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,280
You make my sake taste bad.

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,030
O-Okay...

228
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,960
THE RYUGU KINGDOM - A SOLDIER OF NEPTUNE'S ARMY
JIMBEI     30 YEARS OLD

229
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,230
So Otohime-san was a very unusual woman.

230
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,730
You're a crybaby just like your mother, huh?

231
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,070
Well... I-I don't know...

232
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,700
Were you a soldier of the kingdom?

233
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,910
There weren't that many options for
a man from the Fish-Man District...

234
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,370
...who knew nothing but fighting.

235
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,290
The Fish-Man District?

236
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,540
That's where you're from, right, Hachi?

237
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,960
Sounds like a bad neighborhood.

238
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:37,510
Yes. It used to be a big orphanage where they
housed children without any relatives.

239
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,640
But the orphanage started
to get out of control

240
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,440
and was too much for the
administrators to handle

241
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,770
so it became a lawless area that drew
misfits from all over the island.

242
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,070
Fisher Tiger was the leader
figure in the Fish-Man District

243
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,620
but he left the country to chase adventure.

244
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,870
And I was his lieutenant but
I joined Neptune's army.

245
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,080
Macro and the others became kidnappers
even though they were Fish-Men themselves.

246
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:12,380
And all the others went
their separate ways as well.

247
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,220
But one day...

248
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,760
--Give them back! Please!
--Take them if you want them!

249
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,140
Give them back to her! Do you know
how many signatures there are?

250
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,940
I don't care!

251
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,990
What can you do with these papers? Huh?!

252
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,280
Hey! Cut it out! You're Arlong from
the Fish-Man District, aren't you?!

253
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,250
Arlong from the Fish-Man District?

254
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,040
L-Let go of me!

255
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,130
You're a bit wrong.

256
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,220
THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARLONG PIRATES
ARLONG 25     YEARS OLD

257
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,220
I'm Captain Arlong from the Arlong Pirates!

258
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,560
I make a living by hunting those lowly
pirates who can't even breathe in water.

259
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,770
We're doing it on behalf of
all of you - Neptune's army!

260
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,730
Thank me with your money!

261
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,270
B-Boss Jimbei, don't just watch - help me!

262
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,730
Jimbei?

263
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,820
Hey, punk! Let go of that rookie soldier.

264
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,830
He is my man, in a way.
And the papers with signatures.

265
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,620
I have no interest in them but they're
important for the Queen. So give them back.

266
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,840
--That's Boss Jimbei of Neptune's army!
--Great!

267
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,130
"Boss"? That's a good title.

268
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,140
Sounds like you're running a gang!

269
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,470
Do as I say, Arlong!

270
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,430
Alright. Here.

271
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,560
Here!

272
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,230
Don't be mad, brother.

273
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,610
What? Brother?

274
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,150
It's been a while, huh? I'm your
family from the Fish-Man District!

275
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm not like you.
You're still a pirate, aren't you, scum?

276
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,450
--Don't call me "scum," brother!
--How about trash?

277
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,880
"Trash"?! I've let you say
what you wanted, but that's...

278
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,710
Hey, everybody! It's the
adventurer - Fisher Tiger-san!

279
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,970
--What?
--Tiger-san's back!

280
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,470
--Tiger-san!
--How was the trip?

281
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,010
--Brother Tai!
--Big Brother!

282
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,430
Jimbei! Arlong!
Looks like you guys are doing fine!

283
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,100
It was a long trip, wasn't it?

284
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,270
Yeah, a lot happened.

285
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,360
Stop by at my ship!

286
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,740
Maybe later. I need to go
to the Ryugu Palace first.

287
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,910
I'll take you then.
He doesn't have use for a pirate!

288
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,120
Huh? Big Brother wouldn't say such a thing!

289
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,660
Guys, don't fight!

290
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,430
You are going to free the slaves?

291
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,930
Are you serious?

292
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,690
I am serious. I can't take it anymore.

293
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,770
It's like a living hell
to be a slave isn't it?

294
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,400
As we speak now, they are not
being treated like men.

295
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,400
But...

296
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,110
My mind is set.

297
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,360
I just wanted to tell you
and the Queen in advance

298
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,310
since it will cause you trouble.

299
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,250
Please don't tell anybody about this.

300
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,670
What did you see during your trip?

301
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,390
I saw humans!

302
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,000
And then before long,
something big happened.

303
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,550
Something's happened!

304
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,760
What is it?!

305
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,810
B-Boss Jimbei! T-Tiger-san...

306
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,640
...attacked the Celestial Dragons!

307
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,930
The Celestial Dragons?!

308
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,110
Fisher Tiger's attack on
the Holyland of Marie Jois!

309
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,280
People called him the hero
who freed the slaves.

310
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,990
And at the same time, he became a criminal.

311
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,370
I'm leaving the army today.

312
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,960
Jimbei, are you going to
walk away from your mission?!

313
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,010
Surprisingly, I enjoyed my
role of protecting the island.

314
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,240
But sometimes, paying a debt
of honor is more important

315
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,310
than carrying out my mission!

316
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,940
Big Brother Tai did it at last!

317
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,230
We Arlong Pirates will
join Fisher Tiger now!

318
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,650
Let's go, guys!

319
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,040
And that was how the ruffians
from the Fish-Man District

320
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,460
who admired him assembled.

321
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,870
Welcome to the pirates' world!

322
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,830
We'll fight against the world from now on.

323
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,050
Those of you who are ready, come forward!

324
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,560
In order to make it
impossible to distinguish

325
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,180
between those who were
slaves and those who weren't,

326
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:05,690
everybody used the Sun mark to
cover over the mark of slaves...

327
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,780
...and the Sun Pirates
were formed by Fish-Men!

328
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,730
Fisher Tiger attacked the
Holyland of Marie Jois

329
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,970
and freed Fish-Man slaves
from the Celestial Dragons.

330
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,140
Pursued by the Marines, they fight the
humans in battle after bloody battle,

331
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,680
until he has a fateful encounter with
a human girl with a painful past.

332
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,520
And a certain man finally makes his move.

333
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,570
"Kizaru Appears!
A Trap to Catch Tiger!"

335
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
