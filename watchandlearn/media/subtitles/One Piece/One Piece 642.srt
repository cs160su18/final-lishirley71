The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

We will keep making our own route

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980
Running at full speed

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

23

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,570

Keep on advancing

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,260
The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

We are the one! Go ahead!

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480
Everytime we overcome something,

53

Go along with your curiosity

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,310
and go wherever you want to
go - that's the adventure

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,640
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,560
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,880
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,910
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,350
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,610
When Luffy found out that the prize

77
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,670
for a fighting event was the Flare-Flare
Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,850
He's worth 77 million berries!

79
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,540
A member of the Straw
Hats! "Black Foot" Sanji!

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,880
Let's cut his head off!

81
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,620
Sanji was saved by Violet who
was working for Doflamingo,

82
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,550
and has found out some shocking news!

83
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,480
From the moment
you all arrived here with Caesar,

84
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,360
you were walking into that man's trap!

85
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,740
What you see is Dressrosa this morning.

86
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,840
What does this mean?

87
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,050
Alright! It's time finally!

88
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,370
Rebecca.

89
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,860
I saw the list in the Colosseum.

90
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,760
You entered the competition as I thought.

91
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,240
I told you not to!

92
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,440
I...

93
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,030
I'll do it! I'll win it!

94
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,430
Soldier-san!

95
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,230
So...

96
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,670
So... Hey, can we live together?!

97
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,910
A warrior who cries easily can't win
a competition!

98
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,410
Anesthetic flowers!

99
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,960
What's this smoke?

100
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,940
Meanwhile, after passing out
in the forest of Green Bit,

101
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,630
Robin woke up in the Tontatta Kingdom -
the country of the Little People.

102
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,530
The Big Human is waking up!

103
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,540
Don't try to run! Stay calm!

104
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,370
My body is pinned to the ground!

105
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,270
It's no use trying to move!

106
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,980
You're a villainous Big Human, aren't you?

107
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,180
So this is you Little People's kingdom.

108
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,820
It's two fifty-seven.

109
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,190
We don't have time!

110
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,840
"The Stratagem of the Century!
Doflamingo Makes His Move!"

111
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,040
GREEN BIT - THE BEACH ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE

112
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,260
The appointed time
for Caesar's hand-over is...

113
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,790
...in two minutes.

114
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,390
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

115
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,250
Clank!

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,260
Hey, Law! This is Sanji!

117
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,410
Black Foot-ya! Did you find the factory?

118
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,010
That's not important now!

119
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,280
There he is! "Black Foot" Sanji!

120
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,120
Don't let the traitor
Violet get away, either!

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,320
--Kill them!
--This is it!

122
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,860
This way!

123
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,550
You assholes!

124
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,720
Black Foot!

125
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,230
Do you know what you're in for
if you hit Violet-chan?!

126
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,800
Listen carefully!

127
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,740
You've got to get out of there!

128
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,190
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,280
I have to hand Caesar over soon!

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,750
Doflamingo didn't resign
from the Seven Warlords!

131
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,190
Even if you hand Caesar over to him,
there is no trade whatsoever!

132
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,530
That doesn't make sense.

133
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,520
What do you mean?

134
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,300
We've been...

135
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,570
...totally deceived!

136
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,370
--Your Majesty!
--Please don't quit!

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,530
--Doflamingo-sama!
--We need your explanation!

138
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,570
Why did you abdicate from the throne?!

139
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,330
How noisy. Aren't they here yet?

140
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,240
Here they come.

141
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,500
What?!

142
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,680
A warship is arriving into the harbor!

143
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
What?!

144
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,420
I've seen that logo before!

145
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,740
Cipher Pol Aigis Zero!

146
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,010
They're the Government officials
who work directly under the World Nobles!

147
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,320
Why are they here?

148
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,450
Calm down, people of Dressrosa.

149
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
About the report on

150
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,900
Doflamingo's abdication from the throne

151
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,870
and the Seven Warlords that
spread all over the world...

152
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,940
It was a mistake. Just a false report.

153
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,780
That means...

154
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,980
Doflamingo-sama is not quitting!

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,090
That's great!

156
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,910
Now, we will let the world know about it

157
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,560
through an extra edition
of the newspaper at three today.

158
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,710
It's going to be a secret until then.

159
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,270
You mustn't tell anybody about it.

160
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,580
All nations, keep living peacefully
as if nothing has happened.

161
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,510
That wasn't a dream, wasn't it?

162
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,390
It all happened for real
right before you people

163
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,260
came to this island.

164
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,780
I can't believe it! I'm so confused!

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,600
The World Government?!

166
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,470
It's beyond a Warlord's control, isn't it?!

167
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,540
Yes, you're right.

168
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,510
I'm

169
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,880
scared of Doflamingo so I can't go

170
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,950
but maybe you people can get away in time!

171
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,960
Did you get that?!

172
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,430
Leave the island now!

173
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,130
The news about Doflamingo was a mistake?

174
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,520
What do you mean by that, Saka-san?

175
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,510
Are you saying the Navy Headquarters
were fooled by a false report?

176
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,990
Yes, it's so aggravating!

177
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,420
I'm going to go talk to
the Five Elders at Marie Jois.

178
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,700
I'm sorry but that's what happened.

179
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,760
I need you to keep going ahead to

180
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,290
Trafalgar Law and Doflamingo's
rendezvous point.

181
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,190
Roger that.

182
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,870
Clank.

183
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,240
All units! Go to the beach
on the southeast side!

184
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,530
Hurry up!

185
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,950
You fool. It's too late.

186
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,470
I'm busy, too! I'm gonna hang up now!

187
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,510
Clank!

188
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,160
There they are! Go after them!

189
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,430
What should I do?!

190
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,440
Wow! What the...

191
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,530
Nico Robin's upper half came out of the sand!

192
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,460
Nico-ya!

193
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,470
This is just a clone.

194
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,870
I was listening to the conversation.
It was Sanji, wasn't it?

195
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,470
Hey, where are your actual body and Nose-ya?

196
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,750
If what Black Foot-ya

197
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,090
was talking about is true,
the deal with Doflamingo is off.

198
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,330
Off?!

199
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,290
Then, what's gonna happen to my hand-over?!

200
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,280
It's not gonna happen!

201
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,760
No!

202
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,900
Nico-ya! Summon Nose-ya!

203
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,970
Let's get off of the island now!

204
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,340
The thing is, we're
underground Green Bit now!

205
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,540
Underground?!

206
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,220
We had some trouble...

207
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,990
But both Usopp and I are safe.

208
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,330
We can't help you but

209
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,700
if you're gonna escape,
go without us.

210
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,980
We'll go to the harbor
where we agreed to meet up.

211
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,590
Okay, I got it...

212
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,250
Th-The Navy!

213
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,030
You are Trafalgar Law-san, aren't you?

214
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,400
You're the new admiral,

215
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,970
Fujitora, aren't you?

216
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,710
Here he comes.

217
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,940
Good luck!

218
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,300
Good luck to you guys, too!

219
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,710
That's...

220
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,660
Joker!

221
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,490
Hey, Law!

222
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,250
Well done!

223
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,130
I didn't expect to see a Navy admiral here!

224
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,960
Since I'm no longer a Warlord,
I'm scared as hell!

225
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,570
Liar!

226
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,610
Now, all competitors of
Block C are out there finally!

227
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,580
139 warriors!

228
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,940
It's a battle royal!

229
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,440
Who's gonna win this?!

230
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,800
Finally!

231
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,910
Now, the battle is...

232
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,760
I can't believe you're already
in the ring, Straw Hat!

233
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,900
You're in Block D, aren't you, Cavendish?!

234
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,630
Are you trying to break in?!

235
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,470
Let go of me!

236
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,800
Cut it out! Or you'll get eliminated!

237
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,480
Let's do it!

238
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,090
Yeah!

239
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,730
Kick his ass!

240
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,310
Yes!

241
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm gonna drop every single
one of you into the water!

242
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,990
Great!

243
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,120
Prepare to get crushed!

244
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,090
Huh?! Where did he go?!

245
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,100
That's a big hammer!

246
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,110
When did you get there?!

247
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,750
Gum-Gum...

248
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,350
...Pistol!

249
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,130
That guy's arm stretched like rubber!

250
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,630
A Devil Fruit eater?!

251
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,700
A guy with the "Gum" power -
must be Straw Hat...

252
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,790
Oops.

253
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,200
I'm gonna fight you next!

254
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,900
Um...

255
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,100
This is just a normal punch!

256
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,240
That was close.

257
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,130
Did you just see it?

258
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,960
He's not Lucy! He's Straw Hat...

259
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,850
Stop it!

260
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,910
How annoying!

261
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,250
Gum-Gum...

262
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,790
--Huh?!
--He did it again!

263
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,440
Oh, never mind.

264
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,330
What the hell?!

265
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
Here's a normal kick!

266
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,310
What a pain in the butt.

267
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,400
Hey, that guy with a helmet is interesting!

268
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Oh yeah?!

269
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,610
I've never seen him before.

270
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,000
Who is it?

271
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,260
Like I said, he's Straw Hat...

272
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,780
Go back to the bleachers!

273
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,650
Whoa! What are you doing?! Straw Hat!

274
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,010
That little one is quite strong.

275
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,730
Let's take care of him first.

276
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,570
Oh, they're coming all at once!

277
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,060
Go away!

278
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,790
You can't get away this time!

279
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,830
I got him!

280
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,110
That won't work.

281
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,550
Boom!

282
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,660
Because...

283
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,670
...I'm a rubber man.

284
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,010
That was awesome!

285
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,780
He's quite a fighter!

286
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,270
Alright!

287
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,810
Bring it on!

288
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,440
On this day,

289
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,000
the story spread by the News Coos

290
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,460
takes the whole world by surprise again.

291
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,090
An extra edition?!

292
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,400
It seems like a correction about something.

293
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,570
What?!

294
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,510
What the hell?!

295
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,240
A CANDIDATE FOR WARLORD

296
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,670
Captain, look at this!

297
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,710
What is it?

298
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,980
The big news about Doflamingo was...

299
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,960
A mistake?!

300
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,930
--That's insane!
--How could this happen?

301
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,790
Answer me, Doflamingo!

302
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,730
You used the authority of the

303
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,990
World Government
to fool the whole world...

304
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,700
...just to deceive 10 or so of us?!

305
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,710
Often, the more spectacular the magic,
the simpler the trick.

306
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,510
Law.

307
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,320
"That's ridiculous."

308
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,020
People usually have a stereotypical idea

309
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,460
or an assumption like that
and that's what creates a blind spot.

310
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,730
Nobody can really do such a thing,

311
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,170
even if he hatched some scheme.

312
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,220
You're a pirate!

313
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,370
Even if you're a Warlord and a king,

314
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,830
you don't have the power to spread a lie

315
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,140
all over the world!

316
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,340
The only people in this world

317
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,780
who have the power to do such
a ridiculous thing are...

318
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,590
...the Celestial Dragons!

319
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,280
You don't know Joker's past.

320
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,600
And that will cost you your life!

321
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,480
Don't tell me...

322
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,780
...you're...

323
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,220
It's bit more complicated.

324
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,400
I have only one purpose, Law.

325
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,120
I just...

326
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,120
...wanted to kill you!
