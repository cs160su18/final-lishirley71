00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,670
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,790
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,610
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,290
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,560
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

83
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,330
On top of that, he put prices
on the heads of Luffy and

84
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,080
11 others, and now they're being
hunted by all the citizens.

85
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,440
And with the Straw Hats
fighting the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,540
Doflamingo stood in
Luffy and Law's way to the Royal Palace!

87
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,200
I can't go on... like this!

88
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,190
"A United Front!
Luffy's Breakthrough to the Victory!"

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,950
THE ROYAL PALACE

90
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,970
I'm feeling sentimental now...

91
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,600
What did you come here for?

92
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,500
BELLAMY THE HYENA
A PIRATE, BOUNTY: 195 MILLION BERRIES

93
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,990
Did you kill Straw Hat, Bellamy?

94
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,360
Why did you send Dellinger to kill me?!
Was it really your order?!

95
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,990
Oh boy... What rubbish...

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,480
Isn't there any...

97
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,790
...hope left for me?

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,300
Don't make me say it straight, Bellamy.

99
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,530
Your purpose was different from mine.
From long ago.

100
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,510
You always wanted to become a pirate.

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,270
But not me.

102
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,280
Anything was fine with me.

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,380
Anything?

104
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,330
As long as I could...

105
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,260
...destroy this world!

106
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,410
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 2
THE COLOSSEUM ARMY VS THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,410
Move! Move! Move!

108
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,090
You move, Ideo!

109
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,770
What?!

110
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,920
I'll take down Doflamingo!

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,900
Back off, you bastard!

112
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,340
The one who'll take down Doflamingo and
repay Straw Hat my debt is me!

113
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,700
Get out of my way, kid!

114
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm in a rush!

115
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,940
Hey, what do I look like?

116
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,360
Hey, tell me, Suleiman!

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,230
So quick!

118
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,250
Humph... No matter how quick he moves,
I won't lose him!

119
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,030
You used to be a war executioner, right?!

120
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,300
Those well-developed muscles...

121
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,840
High heels...
His specialty must be...

122
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,560
I love... executing people!

123
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Kicks!

124
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,320
What?!

125
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,300
Oh no... That's too bad.
It's over already.

126
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,550
Here come the Executives of the Family!

127
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,350
Even the Executives are showing
up now, it's too late!

128
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,560
I will repay my debt!

129
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,790
It's the former leader of the
Happosui Army - Chin Jao!

130
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,720
Take him down and win fame!

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,410
Yeah!

132
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,960
Humph! It's not gonna work!

133
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,130
Alright! I'm gonna get
to the third level first!

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,680
What are these bulging stones?

135
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,640
That place is dangerous. Mine...

136
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,850
...Pop!

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,410
Grandpa! I'm coming!

138
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,190
Da-in!

139
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,230
Floaty, floaty...

Ten-Ton Vise!

141
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,450
You see it, idiots?!

142
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,290
That's how powerful our
Family's Executives are!

143
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,670
No, it's just that these guys are...

144
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,540
...too fragile.

145
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,970
Too fra"g"ile! There's the "G"!

146
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,800
Shut up, geezer!

147
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,220
You freak!

148
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,030
--He did it!
--They can't go any farther!

149
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,950
I got you!

150
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,230

THE TOWN IN THE SOUTH - SEVIO

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,150
Darling... Please...

154
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,870
Don't do it!

155
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,830
I-I know...

156
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,930
You know I wouldn't...

157
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,130
...shoot you two...

158
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,610
But because of Doflamingo,

159
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,550
my body...

160
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,840
...is out of my control...

161
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,570
Please run! I beg you!

162
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,790
No...

163
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,420
Don't...

164
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,260
I got him!

165
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,640
--Bring the rope now!
--And treat him! He's been shot!

166
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,060
--The rest of you, put out the fire!
--Okay!

167
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,110
I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Thank you!

168
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,680
I almost killed my family!

169
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,920
It was terrible!

170
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,310
THE OLD KING'S PLATEAU

171
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,280
Do you want to cause the same
tragedy again, Doflamingo?

172
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,260
As long as our captain's here,
he won't let it happen.

173
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,390
Earlier, Rebecca and the others
took off from around there, I suppose...

174
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,770
--Is that... King Riku?!
--What?! Let me see!

175
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,940
There's another big-timer!

176
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,530
It was me who set the
town on fire! I'm sorry!

177
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,280
I sliced up my own friend!

178
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,950
Me, too! Dammit!

179
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,750
It's not your fault.

180
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,630
Everything happened
because of Doflamingo's meddling!

181
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,560
We gotta bring
an end to this game somehow...

182
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,230
Hey!

183
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,260
We found out where King Riku is!

184
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,840
He's with the Five-star God Usopp!

185
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,310
Alright... Let's do it!

186
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,470
But we only capture them!

187
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,140
Okay?

188
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,980
Yeah, if we don't do it,
this game will last until we die!

189
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,790
First, take King Riku and
God Usopp as hostages.

190
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,950
And lure other criminals
using those hostages!

191
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,910
Yeah!

192
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,870
Tell the people all over the country!

193
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,120
Head for Old King's Plateau!

194
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,580
Yeah!

195
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,970
Capture King Riku and God Usopp!

196
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,220
Bring an end to this game by ourselves!

197
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,680
Yeah!

198
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,170
BENEATH THE OLD KING'S PLATEAU - THE JUNKYARD

199
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,500
Kanjuro!

200
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,190
Tell me! Where are you?!

201
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,470
It's Kin'emon!

202
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,600
Answer me if you're here! Kanjuro!

203
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,620
I hear it again!
That beast-like voice...

204
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,090
--Where is it coming from?!
--No idea.

205
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,020
Is it some kind of a curse?

206
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,910
Where is it?!
Where does it come from?!

207
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,770
Don't tell me this voice is...
Everybody, be quiet!

208
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,990
Right there?!

209
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:40,520
THE SMILE FACTORY

210
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,860
What are you guys doing?!

211
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,250
Did you knock over this SAD tank?!

212
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,280
Pick it up!

213
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,400
Are you okay?!

214
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,360
Please stop! There was a sudden earthquake

215
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,210
and the tank got knocked over!

216
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,460
--He's right!
--What caused that earthquake?!

217
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,230
Shut up! You guys don't
need to worry about it!

218
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,750
But...

219
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,750
Don't you guys wanna cure
Princess Mancherie's illness?!

220
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,550
I bet you do!

221
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,720
Of course, we wanna cure it!
How is she doing?!

222
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,450
Um...

223
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,470
I'm afraid the princess isn't
getting better at all!

224
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,930
At all!

225
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,320
What?!

226
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,290
Everybody, are you ready?!

227
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,890
Yeah!

228
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,290
Let's go!

229
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,460
Please! Let us see the princess!

230
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,300
Oh, damn! What a pain!

231
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,550
Shut up and work!

232
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,470
Is that...

233
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,360
You fools, just stop grumbling
and keep making SMILEs!

234
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,100
FROM INSIDE, UNLOCK...

235
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,570
What are you guys doing?!
I said work, idiots!

236
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,090
Quit zoning out! Can't you hear me?!

237
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,370
...THE DOOR!

238
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,620
Those words...

239
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,060
...THE DOOR!

240
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,170
It's the Pink Bees!

241
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,760
Bian!

242
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,510
Inhel! Wicka!

243
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,760
Bomba! Cotton!

244
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,670
Everybody!

245
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,440
They noticed us! Bian!

246
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,280
Roger that!
Pink Bees, the next message!

247
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,500
WE GOT FOOLED!!!

248
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
What? "We got fooled"?

249
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,790
What do they mean?

250
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,340
Hey, you guys! Can't you hear us?!

251
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,420
We got fooled?
Is it about the princess' illness?

252
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,800
Doflamingo has been fooling us?

253
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,730
FIGHT!!!

254
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,790
"Fight"?!

255
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,230
I guess you need another beating
to understand things.

256
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,990
I don't know what's going on
but one thing I know is...

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,820
Friends don't lie!

258
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,950
--Shut up!
--Sanshita!

259
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,340
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF
THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 2

260
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,800
Commodore Hug!

261
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,270
You're too slu"gg"ish! There're the "Gs"!

262
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,190
One more coming-in!

263
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,390
This is it for this guy-in!

264
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,020
Ten-Ton Vise!

265
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,570
--Are you okay?!
--Yeah! You alright, Grandpa?!

266
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,450
That little brat!

267
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,870
Mine Pop.

268
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,910
It's dangerous there, too.

269
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,330
And there.

270
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,360
No! That's it?

271
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,650
I wanted to see more of the Longleg
tribe's kicking techniques!

272
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,800
It's too bad!

273
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,180
Destruction Cannon!

274
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,600
Is it Ideo?!

275
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,660
Too slow!

276
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,650
This is like a gathering of comedians!

277
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,700
I guess we're not supposed to
fight to get there first now.

278
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,320
-Yeah.

279
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,300
Armsmorphosis!

280
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,740
Revolver Girl!

281
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,910
A lite version of King Punch!

282
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,980
Dagama, we're gonna lose this battle
if nothing is done!

283
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,890
Straw Hat!

284
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,180
It's me, military tactician
Dagama's chance to show off!

285
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,400
Doflamingo's at the top of this place?!

286
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,480
Cabbage!
Do you wanna get in my way, again?!

287
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,450
No...

288
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,670
--Get on.
--What?

289
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,040
I mean I'll give you a ride
because I have no other choice!

290
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,160
You sure?!

291
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,210
You wanna get to Doflamingo ASAP, don't you?

292
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,040
Alright!

293
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,390
I'm ready! go!

294
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,790
Have you ever once in your life
been humble?!

295
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,770
--Whatever, just go!
--Don't tell me what to do!

296
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,010
Let's go, Farul!

297
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,890
Listen, if we get caught by the Executives,
we get stuck here.

298
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,130
I'm gonna cut the wall and make a path

299
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,200
so you kick the other enemies' asses!

300
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,980
Got it!

301
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,710
And we're gonna go straight to
the third level...

302
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,530
Hey! That's one too many!
Who are you?!

303
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,770
--Oh, Soldier!
--When did you get on?!

304
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,760
Just now!

305
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,900
I followed the path that Luffyland made!

306
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,420
I see. That's how you followed Straw Hat
and got on Farul... Hey!

307
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,540
--You followed too far!
--Great! I was looking for you!

308
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,740
Even if you're his friend, we're overloaded!

309
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,700
Get off!

310
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,330
We're gonna meet up with Rebecca!

311
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,010
Rebecca is in this enemy territory?!
Why didn't you stop her?!

312
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,260
Listen to me!

313
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,380
We'll rendezvous at the Sunflower Field
on the fourth level.

314
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,470
She's on the criminal list, too!

315
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,160
Don't worry! She's with my friends!

316
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,200
Listen! My dear horse Farul
only can run beautifully

317
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,440
with two people or less!

318
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,900
The bull's back had more space...

319
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,400
By the way, pops,
why did you take off before I knew it?

320
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,710
Whatever the situation is...
what I have to do is...

321
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,080
...bring down Doflamingo
and take back the country!

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,450
But there's one more thing!

323
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,970
There's one man in the
Family's Top Executives

324
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,200
that I wanna kill with my
own bare hands at any cost!

325
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,200
Old dude, you're not willing to die,
are you?

326
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,470
No way! I won't be defeated
with this human body!

327
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,800
--Alright, then!
--Nothing's alright! Get off!

328
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,640
Huh?! You get off!

329
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,130
That's nonsense!

330
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,730
You're the worst!
You really are part of the Worst Generation!

331
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,600
Watch out, fool!
Look where you're going! Hey!

332
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,550
Like I said, don't tell me what to do!

333
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,690
What?!

334
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,950
Is that...

335
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,630
Go ahead, Straw Hat!

336
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,800
We're gonna keep them busy!

337
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,720
What-in?! They're suddenly...

338
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,970
They were disorganized before,
fighting each other!

339
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,190
What?! Why are you doing this, guys?!

340
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,530
I'm Dagama, the military tactician!
This is a war!

341
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,570
Even if we all run wild blindly,
no one can reach the top!

342
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't trust Dagama
but I agreed to his plan.

343
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,580
Keep the Executives here
and let Straw Hat go ahead!

344
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,040
Leave this mess here to us and go!

345
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,000
Make sure to take him there,
Cavendish!

346
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,090
Hey hey,
I'm not public transportation!

347
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,900
We gotta win this war!

348
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,330
Interesting...

349
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,040
Let's go!

350
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,920
The motley band of ruffians
quick offense and defense

351
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,080
allows Luffy and the others to
get close to the Royal Palace!

352
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,600
Meanwhile, Kin'emon finally reunites
the other samurai

353
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,810
of the Wano Kingdom, Kanjuro!

354
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,770
In order to get out of the
deep-underground junkyard,

355
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,980
Kanjuro practices unbelievable sorcery!

356
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,370
On the next episode of One Piece!

357
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,370
"The Second Samurai! Evening
Shower Kanjuro Appears!"

358
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
