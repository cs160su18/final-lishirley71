00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome treasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King of
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone dreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen through
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny is
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve your
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,530
"Sanji the Cook! Proving His Merit
at the Navy Dining Hall!"

18
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,130
Is it true that this ghost ship
fell from the sky?!

19
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,150
I can't believe it...

20
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,140
But Navarone is a grand fortress that prides
itself on its impregnable defense.

21
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,130
Falling from the sky is the only way a
pirate ship could make it this far.

22
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,700
I-I heard that there was no one on board.

23
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,670
But they found coffee and cigarettes
sitting out on the ship

24
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,860
as if there had been people right
there up until that moment.

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,160
And inside the room in the back...

26
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,770
A mountain of gold?!

27
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,120
Moreover, it's the kind of gold buried for
hundreds of years in ancient ruins.

28
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,690
I've never heard such a creepy story.

29
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,900
A-A ghost ship?

30
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,260
They must've been cursed by the
ancient ruins and disappeared.

31
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,210
To the 4th, 6th and 10th
units under Lt. Commander Drake!

32
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,890
Assume second-degree battle
formation and stand by.

33
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,570
I don't know if it's a ghost ship or what,

34
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,740
Commanding officers are
to report to Control Room #1

35
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,100
but they think they can pick a fight

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,550
with our fortress, Navarone?!

37
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,550
in the central building immediately!

38
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,160
Hurry it up!

39
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,840
I repeat! Commanding officers of
the 4th, 6th and 10th units

40
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,840
Just who the hell are these guys?!

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,050
are to report to Control Room #1 in
the central building immediately!

42
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,240
Navarone? I see. I get it now.

43
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,490
Of all places, we jumped right into the
middle of that grand fortress

44
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,670
that the Navy's so proud of.

45
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,290
So what're we gonna do, Captain?

46
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,240
I guess he could care less.

47
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,350
Hurry up! This is an emergency order!

48
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,400
We'll moor the pirate ship to Dock
88 and investigate it thoroughly!

49
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,470
Reporting, sir! The Stan
Marey is demanding entry.

50
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,740
What?!

51
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,090
Since we're in a state of emergency,I
advised them to wait a while, but...

52
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,140
We ran into a storm and have many injured!

53
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,790
This is an emergency! Please allow us
to receive treatment at once!

54
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,610
I know it's a ship from headquarters,

55
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,570
but there's a big possibility that
there're pirates hiding within the fortress.

56
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,720
We cannot permit them to enter!

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,690
If we allow outside ships to come in
now,it'll cause unnecessary confusion and...

58
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,840
Open the gate.

59
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,510
I'll permit their entry. Immediately assign
a medical team to them as well.

60
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,220
Yes, sir!

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,200
Commander!

62
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,720
The uneasiness felt by those who are injured
in the middle of the Grand Line...

63
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,360
You understand that feeling, don't you?

64
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,140
Of course! However...!

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,490
You know, this is the first time I've gotten
a little fired up in a long time.

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,310
Well, they can't get out of the fortress.

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,050
Still, why did they come to Navarone?

68
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,420
Monkey D. Luffy...

69
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,910
Ships are coming in!

70
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,690
We are now on first-degree alert!

71
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,370
Have the boarding inspection bridge ready!

72
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,930
This is a big fortress...

73
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,230
Anyway, where am I? Should I go back?

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,900
What's up with the layout of this fortress?!

75
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,590
It's too huge to grasp the whole thing!

76
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,050
We have to get out of
here as soon as possible...

77
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,610
...but the more time goes
by,the harder it gets!

78
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,790
Where did everyone go?

79
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,000
No way!

80
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,050
What is this?! It's too huge!

81
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,320
Hm? Where's the Merry?

82
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
The Merry's gone!

83
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,640
Hold on a sec! Where's the Merry?!

84
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,720
Where the heck is my gold?!Gold,
gold, gold, gold, gold, gold!

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,220
After we went through all
that trouble to get it...

86
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,360
Ships... And they're battleships...

87
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,580
You must be the 31st unit!Go to
the B Building in the 7th block!

88
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,690
Some ships came in... which
means that this place isn't a lake!

89
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,210
It's connected to the open sea!

90
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,170
All right! I have to gather everyone right
away and find the Going Merry!

91
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,430
If I somehow slip into that crowd
and pretend to be a person on the inside,

92
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,410
I can collect information as well!

93
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,980
Where is it?

94
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,890
Luffy and Zoro's faces are known to
the Navy, but luckily, mine isn't.

95
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,860
Oh, is this it?

96
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,090
Oh, crap!

97
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,680
What is up with this fortress?!

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,090
It's like a maze.

99
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,750
Do you know where the kitchen is?

100
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,180
Kitche... Oh! Yes, I do! Kitchen, right?!

101
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,930
We just came in by ship.

102
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,360
What a pain! We're lost.

103
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,460
Sorry to hear that.

104
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,440
I used to get lost all the time, too,when
I first came here five years ago.

105
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,720
You've been here for five years?!

106
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,670
Then, take us to the kitchen.

107
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,070
We can't ask for help from
the cooks here. Help us out here.

108
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,510
Can I say no?

109
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,880
We came from Marie Jois.There's
no harm in doing us a favor.

110
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,840
There's no benefit, either!

111
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,420
Okay, pretty lady?

112
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,180
No problem!

113
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,530
Do you two know anything about this fortress?

114
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,300
No, we brothers are both cooks, so...

115
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,560
We're cooks of some reputation in the Navy.

116
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,850
Whoa! Big name cooks?!

117
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,930
We're going to be the chiefs
of the kitchen here.

118
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,220
In Marie Jois, we've satisfied
generals who have a discerning palate.

119
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,530
We're far from the kind of cooks who
excrete insignificant meals

120
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,030
in the middle of nowhere.

121
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,030
We first have to show them that
we're in a different league.

122
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,140
When did I ask about that?!In
any case, unless I lose them

123
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,570
and disguise myself or something,I
can't even collect information!

124
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,940
Wow! Just what you'd expect from
the legendary cooks!

125
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,670
Now, all you have to do is turn here and
turn right on the first corner.

126
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,680
Then go straight and turn left
twice,and you'll see the kitchen!

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,240
Okay.

128
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,920
This way, huh?

129
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,610
See ya.

130
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,520
So is this the first corner?

131
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,990
Okay, this will do!

132
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,090
Roronoa Zoro.

133
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,220
They told me that the ship they're calling a
ghost ship is Straw Hat Luffy's ship.

134
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,310
At Commander Jonathan's direction, we,the
unit directly under Lt. Commander Drake's,

135
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,110
were given a secret mission to capture them.

136
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,790
When we face them, the one considered
to be the strongest is...

137
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,070
"On Duty"

138
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,080
...Roronoa Zoro...

139
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,530
He's a great swordsman who used to be
feared as a pirate hunter, right?

140
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,020
I hear that he uses the Three-Sword Style.

141
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,770
In any case, we'll capture them
and make them regret ever coming here.

142
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,170
Who is he saying he'll make regret something?

143
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,450
Hm? I passed by here earlier.

144
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,660
And why are you walking around so openly?!

145
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,060
That hurt, you son of a...! Oh, it's you.

146
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,660
If you're wearing three swords so
openly, they'll know right away!

147
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,310
Hey!

148
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,380
I'll be caught, too, right?! Geez...

149
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,110
In any case, you need to hide.

150
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,450
Hey, my swords...!

151
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,140
It's about time to eat.

152
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,640
I'm hungry!

153
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,320
Phew, they're gone now.

154
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,920
We don't have to hide, you know.

155
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,850
When push comes to shove, we can just fight.

156
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,540
You big idiot! If you do that when
we don't know where everyone else is...!

157
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,340
They'll all meet up, won't they?

158
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,350
Now there's an idea... No, I
mean,the Merry is missing, too!

159
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,220
No need to shout like that.Anyway,
isn't this a nice view?

160
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,300
When we got here, it was
night,so we couldn't see well.

161
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,320
Oh, this is good. Hey, Nami, if we watch from
here, the others may soon app...

162
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,810
Don't be ridiculous!Anyway,
you stay put here!

163
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,740
Seriously, you always get lost.

164
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,480
Hey, my swords! What're you doing?!

165
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,500
Dammit!

166
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,840
In any case, try to keep in mind that
you have no sense of direction.

167
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,880
Once I've found the others,I'll
come and get you, so until then...

168
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,520
Hey, you! What're you doing over there?!

169
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,330
They found me! Oh, no...

170
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,900
"Group Leader"

171
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,000
Stop slacking off out here and
start cleaning already!

172
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,560
"On Duty"

173
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,820
Aye aye, sir!

174
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,290
Man, I'm exhausted from all
this ghost ship business!

175
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,220
Anyway, let's eat and prepare
for an emergency.

176
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,690
Ghost ship?

177
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,310
Did you find anything to eat?

178
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,010
Looks like the dining hall is that way.

179
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,680
Dining hall!

180
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,610
Idiot! Wait!

181
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,990
What're you doing?!

182
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,020
Don't be rash.

183
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,610
I'm gonna eat!

184
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,900
Food... Food...

185
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,550
You're so stubborn!

186
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,330
Who's there?!

187
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,690
Freeze!

188
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,520
Hm? That's strange.

189
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,670
Was it our imagination?

190
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,330
We've been on edge since yesterday.It
must be because we're tired.

191
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,380
In any case, we should eat.

192
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,400
Idiot! They almost caught us! Hm?

193
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,720
This is good. We'll probably look less
suspicious in these uniforms.

194
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,240
Something smells good.

195
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,320
So is this the kitchen?

196
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,490
It looks interesting, but...

197
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,540
Hey, I heard that some ships came in.

198
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,730
What?! Then those assholes are
finally coming?!

199
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,110
Yeah, those brothers are coming here.

200
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,330
First impressions are
important.Show them no mercy!

201
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,100
Yeah!

202
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,790
Meat! I smell meat!

203
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,920
Is the word "patience"not
in your vocabulary?!

204
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,180
My vocabulary consists of the terms"all
the meat you can eat" and "free refills"!

205
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,180
Is that all?! Hey, hey, Luffy!

206
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,220
Food!!

207
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,800
"Full of Power!""Carbohydrates!""Navy
Dining Hall"

208
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,310
So you guys are the Murray Brothers?!

209
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,070
Aw, man...

210
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,700
Murray...?

211
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,750
Hiya!

212
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,630
So you're those despicable cooks
from Marie Jois...

213
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,260
I heard that you said you were doing us
a favor by coming to this fortress

214
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
in the boonies even though you didn't want to!

215
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,500
And that we're excreting insignificant meals!

216
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,690
You've sure got nerves to say that!

217
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,140
What?! Are they confusing us
with someone else?

218
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,150
I don't know what you're all
complaining about!

219
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,610
I'm hungry! Give me food!

220
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,540
So you're the idiots...

221
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:42,140
...who used million-Berry foods to
prepare dinners for the big shots in Marie Jois?

222
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,080
Even if your appointment
was decided by the government,

223
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,740
this is the kitchen, the
most sacred place in Navarone.

224
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,560
I won't let any cooks that I don't accept
set even one foot in here!

225
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,010
Exactly!

226
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,890
That's our Jessica-san!

227
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,230
1,000 stalwarts are always stationed
in this fortress.

228
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,010
Cooks here show their respect by preparing
dishes with all their might

229
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,690
and providing energy to everyone's stomach.

230
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,090
In order to support soldiers
on the front lines,

231
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,040
every morning and every night,we never
lose our focus for even an instant.

232
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,690
We're different from the cooks who sit
back and depend on expensive food!

233
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,300
Are you gonna let me eat those?!

234
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,720
Are you forgetting...

235
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,380
...that good cooking comes from the heart?

236
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,450
In other words, you're saying that
you wanna teach me what cooking is about.

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,910
I'm not trying to say
something as dramatic as that.

238
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,610
I just want you to show us the
pride that you talk so much about.

239
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,790
It doesn't matter who you are in here at all.

240
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,690
But if you don't have credible
skills,you'll cause the others trouble.

241
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760
Let me make this clear.
Unless you satisfy me,

242
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,040
I won't let you call
yourselves cooks in Navarone!

243
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,450
I see... That sounds
interesting, Mademoiselle.

244
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,370
What is it?! What's that commotion?!

245
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,590
Apparently the cooks are starting
a fight over cooking.

246
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,910
Hey, let me see!

247
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,060
Is he the cook who came from headquarters?

248
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,010
You can go ahead and use whatever foods
you like. The rule is simple.

249
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,340
Each will cook for 100 people.The soldiers
who eat it will decide the result.

250
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,510
I don't really know what's going
on,but it sure seems exciting!

251
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,450
Start any time.

252
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,130
I can't lose this fight even if it kills me!

253
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,650
I'm gonna fill their plates with
nothing but juicy parts.

254
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,360
Is he gonna admit defeat without even cooking?

255
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,880
Finished!

256
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,670
100 servings!

257
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,580
How's that?!

258
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,800
Wow! You guys already finished?!

259
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,720
Those look delicious!

260
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,400
Don't touch!

261
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,370
Of course! We cook
1,000 servings for each meal!

262
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,040
We're fast like sharks dashing in the sea!

263
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,450
This is the essence of Navarone!

264
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,130
How wasteful they are...

265
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,180
What's he going to do?

266
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,450
H-He's...!

267
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,220
Can't be...!

268
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,340
He's using the parts we didn't use!

269
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,110
Crush the tuna's bones and head

270
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,230
and mash its guts!

271
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,700
Knead it with vegetable wastes...

272
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,390
...and deep-fry them.

273
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,920
Stew the fat from the meat until it melts...

274
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,030
Cover them with a special sauce made
with stock from the shells.

275
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,520
The bitterness of the tuna's
guts stimulates people's appetites,

276
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,890
and the strong tastes blow
spirits into their exhausted bodies.

277
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,730
Which means that we need marinated
food that isn't too heavy.

278
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,660
The skins of burdock roots and potatoes have
more nutrients than the insides.

279
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,320
They're the ideal nutrient source.

280
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,210
Use broccoli cores to make soft,
sweet-scented dressing.

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,880
La...

282
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,100
...cuisine a la carte!

283
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,210
This is a battlefield, right?It's
always best if the food tastes good,

284
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,340
but wouldn't it be the
worst if you ran out of food?

285
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,610
It doesn't matter if it's 10,000
Berries or a million Berries.

286
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,550
You shouldn't waste even one piece of food.

287
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,090
No matter what food it is, giving love to
the whole thing is a cook's etiquette...

288
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,870
...just like loving everything about a lady.

289
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,180
That was borrowed straight from
a certain old geezer.

290
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,000
I've never tasted anything like this!

291
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
It gives me energy!

292
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,660
Y-Yummy!

293
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,620
Dammit!

294
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,250
Just because we didn't
wanna lose to the famous cook,

295
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,900
we did what we shouldn't do!We
used only the juicy parts!

296
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,610
Food in Navarone is different from
the luxurious food prepared for big shots!

297
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,660
It's the food for soldiers who
live life day-by-day!

298
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,870
That was Jessica-san's belief, and yet...

299
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,050
To think that we, the cooks at
Navarone,were picky about the food...

300
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,510
Eighty-six! Eighty-seven! Eighty-eight!

301
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,930
Eighty-nine! Ninety! Ninety-one! Ninety-two!

302
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,970
Ninety-three! Ninety-four! Ninety-five!

303
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,740
Ninety-six! Ninety-seven!

304
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,190
Incredible...!

305
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,600
Has there ever been anyone who
ate our food this brilliantly?!

306
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,510
Ninety-eight!

307
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,900
Ninety-nine!

308
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,430
One hundred!

309
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,540
What's wrong?!

310
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,950
Are you okay?!

311
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,300
Hang in there!

312
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,800
Y... Y... ummy!!

313
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,640
I'm stuffed! I'm so satisfied!

314
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Let's go.

315
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,930
Yeah! I have no regrets.

316
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,880
Thanks for the food!

317
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,050
I didn't wanna fight a pretty woman like you.

318
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,910
See you again, Mademoiselle.

319
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,490
Hold it!

320
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,880
Hm? You still have something for me to eat?!

321
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,780
Are you leaving me humiliated like this?!

322
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,070
I like your way of eating and your spirit!

323
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,590
Starting today, you two
are a part of our team!

324
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,550
That's what I wanted to hear! Jessica-san!

325
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,670
It's not that easy to find them.

326
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,600
Of course it isn't, Commander.

327
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,200
They may be pirates,

328
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,810
but they wouldn't be in a place like
this where they can be found so easily.

329
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,940
This place is in plain sight from anywhere.

330
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,500
Yeah, there're probably
some who act smart and hide.

331
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,950
But among that kind of pirates,there's
usually one or two who have guts.

332
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,630
Is that right?

333
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,280
Hm?

334
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,120
Looks like I'll be able
to catch a fish today.

335
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,850
Huh?

336
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,550
That darn stupid navigator!

337
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,800
Why the heck did she put them in
such a hard-to-reach place?!

338
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,730
Darn...! Okay!

339
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,400
Damn! I thought I became a
jellyfish for a moment!

340
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,250
Welcome to my Navarone.

341
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,100
We've caught the first one.

342
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,700
What's going on?

343
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,060
Beats me.

344
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

345
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

346
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

347
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

348
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

349
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

350
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

351
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,110
Ugh! You stupid grass-head!

352
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,070
What'd you say?!

353
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,000
You're not supposed to get caught
right after I warned you!

354
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,470
Forget it! You stay there and
cool off for a while!

355
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,150
Where's everyone else?! You all think
about the situation you're in!

356
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,780
Chopper! This is no time for you to
give treatments in the medical room, right?!

357
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

358
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,680
"Captured Zoro and Chopper's
Emergency Operations!"

359
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
