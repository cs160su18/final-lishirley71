up the "end of the dream"

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

We are the one! Go ahead!

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920

Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,220
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,130
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,830
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,500
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

77
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,480
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,440
he decided to enter and fight
fierce battles against other tough

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,310
contenders from the New World.

80
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,850
Meanwhile, at the Tontatta
Kingdom in Green Bit,

81
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,710
where the Little People reside...

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,230
Alright, everybody! Let's get going!

83
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,250
With our hero Usoland!

84
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,490
To take back the 500 friends
who are held captive!

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,790
Don Quixote Doflamingo has
been causing us Tontatta Tribe

86
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,260
a lot of pain recently.

87
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,370
But our connection with him
goes way back before last decade, actually.

88
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,080
It goes back about 900 years ago.

89
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,470
Meanwhile, at the King Riku
Army Headquarters where

90
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,480
anti-Doflamingo protesters are assembling...

91
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,920
Hey, don't let him attack you, Luffy!

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,210
Damn, that bastard!

93
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,320
If there is an event like this, why didn't he tell me?!

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,890
I wanna fight with my swords!

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,460
Give me back Caesar's heart already.

96
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,690
It's so meaningless for you
to keep hanging on here.

97
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:00,350
Your partner - Straw Hat has already
walked into the trap that I set up.

98
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,980
He will never come out
alive from the Colosseum.

99
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,140
It's the end of your alliance.

100
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,990
Law!

101
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,610
Just give up!

102
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,600
"The Fierce Battle Coming to the End!
Lucy vs. Chinjao!"

103
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,730
Gum-Gum...

104
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,400
Eight-Impact Fist!

105
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,780
...Jet Pistol!

106
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,990
Gum-Gum...

107
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,820
...Jet Gatling!

108
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,810
Gum-Gum...

109
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,420
...Jet Stamp Gatling!

110
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,900
You fool!

111
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,260
Go Lucy!

112
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,110
Kick his ass, Chinjao!

113
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,650
They're exchanging fierce punches and kicks!

114
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,500
What a fight!

115
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,820
It's too fast and I can't even
see what's going on anymore!

116
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,190
But I can feel their fighting spirit!

117
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,070
I'm sure what we're seeing now is...

118
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,650
...one of the greatest fights ever
in this Colosseum!

119
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,770
You're quite a fighter.

120
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,520
You're strong, too, as I thought.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,860
What did you say?!

122
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,730
Huh?

123
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,520
What did you just say?!

124
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,310
I'm strong?!

125
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,570
Are you trying to insult me?!

126
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,640
What?! I just said "You're strong"!

127
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,730
As far as I'm concerned, that's an insult!

128
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,650
I'm no better than a wolf
without its fangs now.

129
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,590
I mean, a skin-headed man without his drill!

130
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:36,880
A brat like you can't understand
how miserable I feel living my life like this!

131
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,830
I'm frustrated, disappointed, and sad!

132
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,400
But you can never understand!

133
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,160
How can I understand?!

134
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,180
You just keep messing with me
without explaining anything!

135
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,550
Do you really want to know
why I've become like this?!

136
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,130
No, I'm not that interested.

137
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,090
Well then, I'm gonna tell you before you die
since you insist.

138
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,050
It was 30 years ago.

139
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,210
What the hell is wrong with this ice?!

140
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,290
We can't break it with fire or an ax!

141
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,550
But look at all that unbelievable pirate treasure
under the ice!

142
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,970
You can't make a scratch
with what you have there,

143
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,940
even if you keep trying for 100 years!

144
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,190
This continent is made of what
they call "Crystal Ice Sheet"

145
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,380
and to break it,

146
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,180
you have to put tremendous
pressure on one spot!

147
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,200
Drill Dragon Nail!

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,290
Open Chinjao!

149
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,660
Do you like it there, you thieves?

150
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,300
Guys, tie those treasure thieves up
and dump them into the sea!

151
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,840
Okay, Boss!

152
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,370
Lots of happiness!

153
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:18,640
CHINJAO THE DRILL
THE 12TH LEADER OF A PIRATE GROUP - THE HAPPO NAVY
(30 YEARS AGO)

154
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,720
This room of ice contains everything.

155
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,730
Joys and sorrows from the past.

156
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,590
Hopes for the future.

157
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,310
Several decades worth of
my family's treasures!

158
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,030
My drill head is the only key to the room.

159
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,820
Nobody can invade this place!
Not even the Navy!

160
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,150
Hey, Chinjao!
In order to break your head today,

161
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,390
I've trained myself by destroying
about eight mountains

162
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,160
like they were my punching bags!

163
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,520
It's no use!

164
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,000
There is not a thing in the world
harder than my head!

165
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,640
Prepare for it, Chinjao!

166
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,040
I'm gonna break that fist of yours
that you're so proud of, Garp!

167
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,780
Boss!

168
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,570
He did it!

169
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,400
--Let's leave!
--All ships, set sail!

170
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,830
Boss!

171
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,080
Boss! I'm glad that you're okay!

172
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,360
The drill...

173
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,570
Where is my drill?!

174
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,510
Where did my drill go?!

175
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,140
Open Chinjao!

176
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,090
Drill Dragon Nail!

177
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,920
Open Chinjao!

178
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,440
Drill Dragon Nail!

179
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,630
Open! Drill Dragon Nail!

180
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,650
Open! Drill Dragon Nail!

181
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,640
--Boss!
--Please stop, Boss!

182
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,340
You're gonna die!

183
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,730
Open! Open! Open! Open! Open!

184
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,760
It won't open.

185
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,700
What should I do?! Those are my treasures!

186
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,010
I can see them right there!
They're my everything!

187
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,030
My fortune!

188
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,080
Damn Garp! I won't forgive you!

189
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,020
I will carry this anger even towards
your children and grandchildren, Garp!

190
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,350
I will keep...

191
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,990
...holding a grudge against you, you bastard!

192
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,190
A short time later, I retired from pirating.

193
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,210
I lost my power and my heart was broken.

194
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:27,580
I became a lifeless shell,
just idling my time away.

195
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,740
But...

196
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,090
...I didn't expect to see
Garp's grandson like this!

197
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,350
This must be destiny!

198
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,760
I have to take you down
right here at any cost

199
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
and make you pay for what your grandpa did!

200
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,380
This must be destiny!

201
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,930
I have to take you down
right here at any cost

202
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,150
and make you pay for what your grandpa did!

203
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,160
What are you talking about?!
Grandpa and I are different people!

204
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,000
Not so different to me!

205
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,300
I can't get beaten by you here!

206
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,650
I've got things to do!

207
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,640
I'm gonna win Ace's fruit at any price
and become the King of the Pirates!

208
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,210
That's a joke! You have no chance!

209
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,040
They lionized you squirts by calling you all
"the Worst Generation"

210
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,390
and it looks like it emboldened you.

211
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,750
But you guys aren't strong enough to
go across the sea that we fought on.

212
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,330
After Whitebeard's death,
not much can be expected.

213
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,130
The only guy who looks
good is Blackbeard Teach!

214
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,430
Blackbeard?

215
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,080
If I had to pick one, it's him.
But anyway,

216
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,440
if you're only good enough
to compete against me

217
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,860
in my present condition, you have no chance!

218
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,980
Just give up being a pirate!

219
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,220
Head-Arms Spin!

220
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,610
Wild Dance!

221
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,760
Gum-Gum...

222
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,700
...Hawk Rifle!

223
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,860
Lucy's going for it!

224
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,400
It's not over yet!

225
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,340
You're not too bad but if
a guy like Rayleigh chose

226
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,900
a brat of this level...

227
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,830
...as the flag-bearer for the new generation,

228
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,140
he's not as smart as he used to be!

229
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,250
The Navy showed some good insight

230
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,490
when they squelched the most evil of the lot,

231
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean Ace, of course,
in the war two years ago.

232
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,950
That fool had the demon's blood in his veins!

233
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,680
You think you can beat the Navy admirals

234
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,430
and the Four Emperors and surpass Roger?!

235
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,790
That's impossible!

236
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,700
Gum-Gum...

237
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,400
...Rocket!

238
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,900
Lucy is flying?!

239
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,240
That's an incredibly high jump!

240
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,580
Come on! I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

241
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,680
With 30 year worth of my anger toward Garp,

242
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,450
I'm gonna give you an all-out blow,
Straw Hat Luffy!

243
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,290
What's that?!

244
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,560
Am I just hallucinating or...

245
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,290
Lucy's arm looks very big!

246
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,450
Watch what I'm gonna do, Garp!

247
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm going to kill your precious grandson!

248
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,350
Pay for it!

249
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,840
Your old man's punch took everything
away from me!

250
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,870
Stop whining over one punch!

251
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,580
I can't count how many times
I got punched by him!

252
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,450
I'm going to smash you
to the marrow of your bones!

253
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,620
Eight-Impact Fist Technique!

254
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,520
Gum-Gum...

255
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,190
...Thor...

256
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,250
Non-Drill Dragon...

257
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,000
...Elephant Gun!

258
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,070
...Non-Nail!

259
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,570
Whaaat?!

260
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,640
Whaaat?!

261
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,210
Whaaat?!

262
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,730
Whaaat?!

263
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,040
--Old man!
--Grandpa!

264
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,230
Oh, he went out of the ring!

265
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,920
Chinjao is eliminated
by being thrown out of the ring!

266
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,650
What a man!

267
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:05,290
He beat the legend and
won the fierce battle for Block C!

268
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,240
Lucy the Gladiator!

269
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,880
Yeah!

270
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:16,580
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

271
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,490
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!...

272
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,960
I didn't expect him to go this far!

273
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,550
It's really a surprising ending!

274
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,780
Cut the "Lucy" crap!

275
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,650
Those cheers are irritating!

276
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,140
He got into the limelight
even under a fake name!

277
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,650
Just come back here already!

278
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm not gonna let you get
away this time, Straw Hat!

279
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,610
Didn't you hear what I said before?

280
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,330
I'm not gonna let you kill him.

281
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,810
Cavendish!

282
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,540
If you get in my way,
I'm gonna kill you, too, Bartolomeo!

283
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,090
Try it!

284
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm gonna kill Straw Hat!

285
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,960
Straw Hat?

286
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,080
How much farther can he carry the momentum?!

287
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,870
And who is going to win the championship
and the Flare-Flare Fruit?!

288
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,700
How exciting!

289
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,080
I get it now!
