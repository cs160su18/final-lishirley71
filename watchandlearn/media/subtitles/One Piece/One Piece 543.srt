00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Daybreak hasn’t come yet and I can’t wait

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,690

22

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,900
It's not our way to worry

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,350
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,980
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level.

77
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,400
Meeting Jimbei again at the Sea Forest,

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,660
Luffy learns about the Fish-Man Island

79
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,200
along with Nami, Sanji, Chopper,
Franky and the others.

80
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,500
It's okay to cry!

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,460
Don't think that we're like
those stupid Celestial Dragons!

82
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,720
Look closely.

83
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,930
What?

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,650
We won't kill anybody!

85
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,480
We'll take her...

86
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,820
...to her hometown!

87
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:30,910
"The Death of the Hero!
A Shocking Truth of Tiger!"

88
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,210
We finally got an Eternal
Pose to Koala's hometown!

89
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,540
12 YEARS AGO - THE GRAND LINE

90
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,170
Nyu! Koala, you can go back to your home!

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,220
Um...

92
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,470
I can't believe my eyes.
You've changed a lot!

93
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,310
KOALA (THE FORMER SLAVE GIRL)

94
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,930
You look like a girl now!

95
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,600
I don't normally wear these...

96
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,400
What? We bought them for you
but you don't like them?

97
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,200
You got your hair cut, too.
Your mother will be really happy.

98
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,620
I...

99
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,080
I should clean.

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,210
Nyu! You need to stop working
when you don't know what to do!

101
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,550
This is not Marie Jois!

102
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,550
Leave her alone.

103
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,800
She needs time.

104
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,060
THE SHIP'S DOCTOR OF THE SUN PIRATES
ALADDIN

105
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,060
Trauma can't be healed that easily.

106
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,680
Alright.

107
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,850
You understand her very
well, Brother Aladdin.

108
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,480
Because you were a slave yourself.

109
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,730
But wouldn't you rather kill her right now?

110
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,990
She's a human just like
the one who owned you!

111
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,450
Stop it, Arlong!

112
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,790
Tell us the truth.
What did your mother tell you?

113
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,540
Your parents looked down
on Fish-Men, didn't they?

114
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,920
That's how human society is!

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,800
They think that they're
the best race in the world.

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Their children are spoiled
by watching their example.

117
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,230
It won't stop until somebody destroys them!

118
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,360
I suppose you guys have seen it enough
while we were sailing these past 3 years.

119
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,200
Their disrespectful
contemptuous look when they see us.

120
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,450
I don't know what I would've done
to them if the Boss wasn't there.

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,970
That was only a few of them.

122
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,050
--The others didn't look like that.
--Brother Jimbei...

123
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,560
Everytime I see them,
they all look terrified to me.

124
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,230
Is it because we're pirates?

125
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,860
Why are you so afraid of us?

126
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,950
Because I don't know you folk.

127
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,330
If you don't know someone,
you naturally fear them?

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,540
We've only known the bad sort of humans.

129
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,170
We don't know anything about humans yet.

130
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,840
So getting to know someone
would change something?

131
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,430
Nyu. Hey, Koala.

132
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,640
What?

133
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,890
Guess which hand it's in.

134
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,400
Well, where is it now?

135
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,900
Um... This one.

136
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,530
Nope! It's here!

137
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,570
Alright, one more time.

138
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,910
Nyu. Get it right this time.

139
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,830
Uh-huh.

140
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,160
Where is it?

141
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,040
This one.

142
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,000
Wrong again!

143
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,190
Just as Koala was fitting in so well.

144
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,440
That's when we arrived at Foolshout
Island - where she came from.

145
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,030
THE GRAND LINE - FOOLSHOUT ISLAND

146
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,450
Koala, get off of the ship.

147
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,030
This is your home island.

148
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,460
--Where is your home village?
--Huh?

149
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,040
--I'll walk you to the entrance to the village.
--Uh-huh!

150
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,510
Don't go, Koala! Come with us!

151
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,840
You're a good girl even
though you're a human.

152
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,300
Stop crying, you guys.

153
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,060
I'll tell everybody in the village...

154
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,940
...that there are so many good Fish-Men!

155
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,740
Thank you, everybody!

156
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,240
Goodbye!

157
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,790
Hey, take care of yourself!

158
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,570
I'm sure she'll grow up into a
mean-spirited human like the others.

159
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,370
What did you just say?!

160
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,580
Jimbei!

161
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,040
Arlong, you bastard...

162
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,840
Brother Jimbei.
You've changed a lot in last 3 years.

163
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,800
What?

164
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,050
Think about it. What's the point in her
telling people that Fish-Men are nice?

165
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,560
It's like Otohime's speeches,
her voice will just ring hollow.

166
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,820
She's back!

167
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,780
He's right! Your daughter is back!

168
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,740
--I'm so glad!
--Yeah...

169
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,370
Everybody!

170
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,160
Hurry up! She came back!

171
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,210
Koala? Koala!

172
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,670
Mom...

173
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,020
Koala!

174
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,440
Mom! Mom!

175
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,940
Mom!

176
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,240
Mom!

177
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,740
That is the captain of the Sun Pirates...

178
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,580
Fisher Tiger!

179
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,160
He's a bad man, isn't he?
Because he's a Fish-Man...

180
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,170
Shh!

181
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,680
It must've been painful
and hard being a slave!

182
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,560
But Mom, not everybody was
like the Celestial Dragons!

183
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,140
What?

184
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:37,690
I thought Fish-Men were all terrible
but there were so many nice Fish-Men!

185
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,900
That's because you're only a child.

186
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:48,160
No! I know it because I was with Uncle
Tiger and the others all this time!

187
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,910
You would think so too
if you'd lived with them!

188
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,550
Uncle!

189
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,130
Uncle Tiger!

190
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,010
Thank you for keeping your promise!

191
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,180
I'll never forget you - Uncle Tiger...

192
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,940
...and Hachi-san,
Aladdin-san and all of the Sun Pirates...

193
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,610
...for the rest of my life!

194
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,200
Thank you so much!

195
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,200
I want to believe that when you grow up,

196
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,370
humans and Fish-Men will...

197
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,630
I'm Rear Admiral Strawberry
from the Navy Headquarters.

198
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,720
Someone on this island
informed us of your arrival.

199
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,310
The elders of this village knew there
might be trouble if we stopped you

200
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,060
but they approved it.

201
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,860
On the condition that we wouldn't repossess
the girl who is the rightful property

202
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,360
of the Celestial Dragons.

203
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,370
Fisher Tiger, captain of the Sun Pirates.

204
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,540
You are charged on two counts.
I'm sure you know this already.

205
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,580
Assault and evasion.

206
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,030
What was that? I heard gunshots!

207
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,780
It's from the direction Boss headed!

208
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,740
Did something happen to him?!

209
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,370
Hey, look at the sea!

210
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,420
It's the Navy! We're surrounded-choo!

211
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,290
Why are they here?

212
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,210
We're trapped!

213
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,550
That brat was a ploy to lure us here!

214
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,800
And Big Brother and all
of us took it like fools!

215
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,060
See?! That's what humans do!

216
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,530
Damn the Navy!

217
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,780
Boss! Boss Tai is in danger!

218
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,830
Arlong!

219
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,330
Can you handle this? We
gotta go save the Boss!

220
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,540
Okay, Brother Jimbei!

221
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,710
You have to bring Big Brother back safely!

222
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,880
I know! Let's go!

223
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,010
Arlong-san, this is not good!
The ship is gonna be wrecked!

224
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,010
Everybody, get off of the ship!

225
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,890
Let's hijack one of the Navy ships!

226
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,910
Why is he still alive?

227
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,200
He's been shot so many times!
Why is he still standing?!

228
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,250
I won't forgive you...

229
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,550
I won't forgive you!
I won't forgive you, humans!

230
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,210
Shoot him!

231
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,810
I think I heard something.
Did you hear anything, Mom?

232
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,930
No.

233
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,810
Boss...

234
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,480
Boss!

235
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,940
Rear Admiral-dono! The Sun Pirates are here!

236
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,610
So that must be...

237
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,200
...Jimbei.

238
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,460
You all... I'm sorry!

239
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,330
Boss!

240
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,000
You're responsible for all of this?!

241
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,130
Everything I've done is for justice...

242
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,090
...and to destroy the Sun Pirates!

243
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,180
Damn the Navy!

244
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,930
I'll kill you too!

245
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,260
Go ahead! I'd like to see you try!

246
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,110
We managed to rescue Boss

247
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,900
and flee to sea with a Navy
ship that Arlong stole.

248
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,110
But...

249
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,330
Boss!

250
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,500
What do you mean that you don't
want a transfusion? Boss!

251
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,170
Don't be ridiculous!

252
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,630
You lost too much blood!
You're gonna die if you don't get one!

253
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:58,510
The Boss' blood type is rare! No one
in our crew has the same blood type!

254
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:04,020
The blood stock on this Navy ship must be...

255
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,690
...human blood.

256
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,650
That's right. But humans
and we share the same blood.

257
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,150
So we can use human blood to save you!

258
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,570
Now let me do this!

259
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,280
No!

260
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,250
I'd rather die than live with their blood!

261
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,330
Their blood is filthy.

262
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,590
They never stop disrespecting us Fish-Men!

263
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,720
Boss...

264
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I don't wanna owe them anything!

265
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,850
I don't need mercy from them!

266
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,060
I don't wanna give in to humans!

267
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,520
Big Brother! Was there something...
between you and the humans?!

268
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,990
I didn't wanna tell you this!

269
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,540
On my last trip, I...

270
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,910
It was a long trip, wasn't it?

271
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, a lot happened.

272
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,380
What did you see during your trip?

273
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,600
I saw humans!

274
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,770
Soon after I set off on my trip,

275
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,900
--I was caught.
--What?

276
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,440
I spent several years in Marie Jois.

277
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,700
I was...

278
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,410
...a slave!

279
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,240
No!

280
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,250
Boss!

281
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,210
What I saw there was the insanity of humans!

282
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,050
I fled for my life but...

283
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,470
...I couldn't just forget about
all those slaves that I saw!

284
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,970
Listen carefully!

285
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,060
I did things the way I wanted and...

286
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,980
...I interfered with Queen
Otohime as a result.

287
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,530
But she is right.

288
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,870
Everybody wants peace, of course!

289
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,460
But the only people who can make
a difference on that island...

290
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,090
...are children of the next generation
like Koala who aren't prejudiced.

291
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,350
So, please!

292
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,980
Don't tell the people
on the island anything!

293
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,980
Neither the tragedy we endured
nor of our anger towards humans!

294
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,110
But Big Brother...

295
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,570
Arlong!

296
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,200
There are so many humans
who are compassionate!

297
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,160
I know! But...

298
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,920
...it's funny - the dying leave
only their resentment behind.

299
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,380
And even though I know
that there are kind humans,

300
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,470
there is a devil inside of me that is...

301
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,930
...clouding my thoughts.

302
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,480
My whole body rejects their blood!

303
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,600
I can't...

304
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,150
...accept humans!

305
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,160
Boss! Don't say such a
thing and live! I beg you!

306
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,620
You don't have to die!

307
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,790
Boss! No matter what you say,

308
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:02,130
you're the greatest benefactor to
all the slaves who were freed by you!

309
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,010
You're a hero to all Fish-Men,
who accomplished such a great feat!

310
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,890
I'm so happy...

311
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,310
You're not strong enough!

312
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,220
What?!

313
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,640
You have to step further. You can't
protect anybody with that punch!

314
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
Huh? Protect?!

315
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:22,940
Brother!

316
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,110
If there is nobody else
who wants to challenge me,

317
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,950
I'll become the leader of the
Fish-Man District from today!

318
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,990
My name is Tiger!

319
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,370
Since I'm your brother now,
leave everything up to me.

320
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,710
Your life is my life!

321
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,750
I'll keep my men safe!

322
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,720
Boss!

323
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,680
--Boss!
--Boss!

324
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:15,790
Boss!

325
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,880
Fisher Tigers death sent
ripples far and wide.

326
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,670
Can Fish-Men and humans coexist,
or must they remain separate?

327
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,260
As the Fish-Men waver,
Arlong's hatred of humans

328
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,270
and Jimbei's desire to preserve
Otohime and Tiger's ideals

329
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,390
will bring their convictions into conflict!

330
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

331
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,480
"The Sun Pirates Split! Jimbei vs Arlong!"

332
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
