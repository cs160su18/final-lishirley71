2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,020
To rescue his brother Ace who
has been captured by the navy,

50
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,950
Luffy stowed away on a navy ship with
the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock's help

51
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,490
and headed to the Great
Prison - Impel Down!

52
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,240
Meanwhile, the rest
of the Straw Hats

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,510
who had been sent to separate
islands by Bartholomew Kuma are...

54
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,790
This is a country of laborers.

55
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,210
Pull! Pull!

56
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,440
The people who work here are
criminals from various countries

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,310
or citizens of countries that refused to
be allied with the World Government.

58
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,310
In other word, slaves.

59
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,770
--How long until the bridge is complete?
--I have no clue.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,340
You'll become one of laborers so all you
have to worry about is making the bridge!

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,160
Is this good to eat? I've
never seen a fruit like this!

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,830
Usopp'n!

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,960
Boy! What was it?! Did
that plant try to eat me?!

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,500
Of course, they're
man-eating plants'n!

65
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,320
Where the hell am I?!

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,940
This is the Swindling
Forest - Glinston!

67
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,590
H-H-Help me!

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,260
"The Friends' Whereabouts! A Princess
Negativity and the King of Demons!"

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,420
I didn't know navy sailors
got to eat grub this good!

70
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,830
But the meals that Sanji
cooks are way better!

71
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,260
"Hancock & Luffy"

72
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,080
Love-Love Beam!

73
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,810
I can't stop thinking about
those two girls on Luffy's crew.

74
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,980
So you choose those
two girls over me?!

75
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,900
I told you to forget about me.

76
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,650
I didn't know you
were so stubborn.

77
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,600
Tell me what you don't
like about me, Luffy!

78
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
I'll change myself for you!

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,340
Don't leave me, Luffy!

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,210
I won't back off!

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,830
Because...

82
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,590
The love those two have for
Luffy can't compare to mine!

83
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,710
Whew! Couldn't eat another
bite! That was so good!

84
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,790
Luffy!

85
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,600
Don't forget that
you are a stowaway.

86
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,470
Is that how that beautiful,
elegant empress laughs?

87
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,700
Well, I kinda find
that attractive, too.

88
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,460
But something is not right.

89
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,380
"More investigation
is needed."

90
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,970
Meanwhile, the other crew who had been sent

91
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,170
"Grand Line, Kuraigana Island"

92
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,290
to separate islands by
Bartholomew Kuma are...

93
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,460
"Ruins of Shikearu Kingdom"

94
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,680
I'm holding a grudge...

95
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
I'm holding a grudge...

96
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,140
I'm holding a grudge...

97
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,230
I know I said that

98
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,860
if I were to travel, I would go to a dark,
damp old castle shrouded in mystery

99
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,190
and spend my time
singing dark songs.

100
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,910
Damn that Kuma!

101
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,270
But I didn't know there
would be no servants!

102
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,590
And I didn't know there wouldn't be bagel sandwiches
and hot chocolate in a comfy bed in the morning!

103
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,630
I didn't know there wouldn't
be any stuffed animals here!

104
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,320
Where am I? Moria-sama!

105
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,560
I miss you, Kumacy!

106
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,110
I wanna go back
to Thriller Bark...

107
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,490
What is that?

108
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,880
That's what I thought! Somebody
has been sent here like me!

109
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,760
I hope that
somebody is cute.

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,730
I can't expect too much!

111
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,990
Anyway, I'm not on
my own anymore!

112
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,960
H-He is...

113
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,400
one of Straw Hats!

114
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,290
He must have been
beaten by Kuma.

115
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,130
He's dead, isn't he?

116
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,020
He's still alive with all
those scars and bruises!

117
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,980
Looks like it's just a matter
of time before he's dead.

118
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,630
That serves you right!

119
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,690
I'm alive...

120
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,240
Where am I?

121
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,590
You are...

122
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,390
Run!

123
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,640
Negative Hollow!

124
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,080
I don't deserve to walk on the
same earth with everyone.

125
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,650
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,990
Why are you here?

127
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,040
What about you?! Don't start
screaming all of sudden!

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,750
Where is my sword?

129
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm not gonna
return your weapon!

130
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,590
You bitch!

131
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,510
Take this!

132
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,430
Negative Hollow!

133
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,930
I'm such a piece of garbage.
I'm sorry to be alive.

134
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,250
Yes! I can do anything
if I put my mind to it!

135
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,790
How dare you!

136
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,380
Stop talking with your
low voice! It's not cute!

137
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,800
You serve me from
now on! Understand?

138
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,300
Be cute!

139
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,600
What the hell
are you doing?!

140
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,190
Get off of me!

141
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,690
I'm not alone anymore!

142
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,440
Shit! I can't move!

143
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,450
What the hell?

144
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,710
Kumacy!

145
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,330
What did you do to me!

146
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,620
Get off of me!

147
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,580
I'm sorry that I yelled...

148
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,920
It's okay as long as
you learned a lesson.

149
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,140
You little bitch!

150
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,030
I'm sorry about my attitude.

151
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,270
Screw you!

152
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,840
I'll call you "mistress"...

153
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,350
I won't!

154
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,730
I'm really sorry that
I'm being so rude.

155
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,230
That's enough, you idiot!

156
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,960
I don't have any
time to waste.

157
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,580
I got to go back.

158
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,090
The exit is that way.

159
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,490
Yeah?

160
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,580
Why did I tell you that?

161
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,120
Where're you going?! How
can you miss the door?!

162
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,690
Hey!

163
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,550
What? You wanna tell
me where my sword is?

164
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,170
Y-y-y...

165
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,190
...you gonna leave?!

166
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,120
It's none of your business!

167
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,720
I'm not gonna let
you go so easily!

168
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,850
You've got to deal with
me a little bit longer!

169
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,040
"Grand Line, Namakura Island"

170
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,390
The Land of Poverty, "Harahettania"

171
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,440
We call on you to answer us!

172
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,820
We call on you to answer us!

173
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,200
We call on you to answer us!

174
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,710
We pray that all those hateful
people will be terrorized and killed!

175
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,270
Grant our wish!

176
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,910
We call on you to answer us!

177
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,110
We call on you to answer us!

178
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,320
Come, Satan!

179
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,650
Come, Satan! Come, Satan!

180
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,760
Grant our wish!

181
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,070
Satan-sama! Satan-sama!

182
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,750
Is-Is this the Devil?

183
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,510
The black magic
really worked!

184
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,930
What a dreadful figure!

185
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,720
He's definitely unearthly!

186
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,910
Our prayer will be answered!

187
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,150
We must have our revenge!

188
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:50,780
--There is nothing left for us!
--The Long-arm Tribe took everything from us!

189
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,950
Satan-sama, the king of
devils! If our wish come true,

190
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,020
we are all prepared to
sell our souls to you!

191
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,450
Leave them all bloodied!

192
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,550
The king of devils, Satan-sama!
The king of devils, Satan-sama!

193
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,470
The king of devils,
Satan-sama!

194
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,010
How far have I
been carried away?

195
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,980
What happen to Luffy
and the others?!

196
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,130
I must go back to meet them!

197
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,170
W-Wait a minute! Don't go
back to Hell, Satan-sama!

198
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,990
--Try to stop him!
--Maybe we haven't offered him enough!

199
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,610
What does
Satan-sama want?!

200
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,250
A sacrifice? Some blood?

201
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,380
What should we do?

202
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,500
What should we offer to
make him grant our wish?!

203
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,970
What do I want?

204
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,910
Excuse me.

205
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,710
Could I look at your panties?

206
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,060
U-Underwear! Hurry and
show him your underwear!

207
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,140
Um...

208
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,560
I don't need to see the
guys' underwear. Wow!

209
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,190
Returning to the present, to rescue his
brother Ace from prison,

210
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,400
Luffy speeds steadily over the waves
to the Great Prison - Impel Down!

211
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,900
Something stinks! It reeks!

212
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,560
Whew! Couldn't eat another
bite! That was so good!

213
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,100
Luffy!

214
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,080
Don't forget that
you are a stowaway.

215
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,880
Hancock! Is anybody
else in your room?

216
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,720
Oh, damn!

217
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,610
Lieutenant Stalker, did you
really hear someone else?

218
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,010
Yes! I'm sure that I heard "Whew!
Couldn't eat another bite!"

219
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,020
I don't think the
empress would say that.

220
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,660
It can't be!

221
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,020
If that was her, I'll give
myself a Mohawk!

222
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,370
I'll do that, too!

223
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,040
W-Whew! Couldn't
eat another bite!

224
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,540
She said it!

225
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm done. Take these plates.

226
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,950
Don't forget the amount.
I need it five times a day.

227
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,550
Isn't that a bit much?!

228
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,630
What about our food?!

229
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,500
I don't care if you
starve to death!

230
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,090
She's terrible!

231
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,150
But, beautiful!

232
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,230
6 days left for the public
execution of Portgaz D. Ace!

233
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,800
After having all their guard
ships destroyed by Whitebeard,

234
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,820
tensions at Navy
Headquarters are rising.

235
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:31,250
Renowned marines started assembling at the
harbor of Marinford from various regions.

236
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:55,100
In the name of justice, the machines of war were
steadily being built up at Navy Headquarters.

237
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,360
Meanwhile, in the
Holyland of Marejois...

238
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,290
The Seven Warlords of the Sea

239
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,110
who had already been summoned
were told the locations of their battle positions.

240
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,750
But they are all ruffians who
can be tamed by no one.

241
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,920
One thing is certain:

242
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,770
It is impossible for them to
cooperate and fight together.

243
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,900
O-Old man!

244
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:55,790
How can you still live with
all those terrible wounds?

245
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,330
Ace!

246
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,840
Because of you, the
Navy Headquarters -

247
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,470
No! All of the World
Government! - is a mess.

248
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,270
K-Kill me!

249
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,110
You should kill me!

250
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,280
Kill you?

251
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,360
You idiot! Nothing
can stop it now!

252
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,330
Even if you die now, that won't
prevent Whitebeard from fighting!

253
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,460
Nobody can stop it now.

254
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,130
We made the
king of the sea...

255
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,510
...angry!

256
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,290
Father!

257
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,670
Setting aside his concern for his crew,

258
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,130
Luffy heads to Impel Down to save Ace.

259
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,840
An inescapable prison for
the most terrible criminals.

260
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,560
Will Luffy be able to reach his brother, Ace?

261
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

262
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,140
"A Deadly Infiltration! The
Underwater Prison Impel Down!"

263
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
