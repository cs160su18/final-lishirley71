2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,690
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,000
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,580
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,110
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,820
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,970
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,680
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,270
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,150
Luffy...

25
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,750
"Luffy in Big Trouble!
Fishmen vs. the Luffy Pirates"

26
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,110
What the...?

27
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,030
Which one of you is Arlong?!

28
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,340
Arlong?

29
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,490
My name happens to be Arlong...

30
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm Luffy.

31
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,810
Luffy?

32
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,520
So, what are you?

33
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,150
A pirate!

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,190
That's him! He's here!
The guy who likes taking walks!

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,170
Hold it, you.

36
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,060
Where do you think you're goin'?!

37
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,440
You need to run things
by us first, kiddo.

38
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,040
Yeah!

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,550
If you don't stop...

40
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,580
Move!

41
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,330
What does a pirate want with me?

42
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,740
Who the hell are you?

43
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,210
Luffy... Help me...

44
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,120
Don't make our navigator cry!

45
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,030
Why, you...

46
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,720
How dare you insult Arlong-san?!

47
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,470
Butt out, small fries!

48
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,770
Yeesh. You just had to
run on ahead by yourself...

49
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,220
It's not like I'd lose on my own.

50
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,710
Idiot! When did I say
I was worried about you?!

51
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,450
I just don't want you
hogging all the prey!

52
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,380
Oh!

53
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,500
I-I don't mind if you
hog them all, though!

54
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,990
You sure got some guts.

55
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,120
That's him! He's the
unknown swordsman!

56
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,470
It's Roronoa Zoro.

57
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,800
Yeah? Yeah, I thought so!
He tricked me!

58
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
Look, sine, and hinker...

59
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,440
No! Hook, line, and sinker... right?

60
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,200
Look! It's Long-nose!

61
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,180
D-Didn't Nami kill him?!

62
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,890
The bastard's alive. Which means...

63
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,870
I knew it.

64
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,510
The girl was a traitor,
just as I suspected!

65
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,430
Hey! Who are those guys?!

66
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,330
Hold it!

67
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,500
He sent Arlong flying!

68
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,010
Unbelievable!

69
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,080
No ordinary human could do that!

70
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,490
They're...

71
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,340
Do you still want to
try to break in now?

72
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,070
If you go, you'll wind up
putting a damper on this fight.

73
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,990
You'll only get in their way!

74
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,790
B-But... why are they fighting?

75
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,430
What reason do they have to fight?!

76
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,950
Reason to fight?

77
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,510
Big Sis Nami was crying!

78
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,780
Do they need any more reason than that

79
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,150
to put their lives on the line?

80
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,600
A pirate, huh? I see...

81
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,360
So that's what you guys' deal is.

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,360
You were after Nami
from the very start.

83
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,470
But...

84
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,860
What can you four inferior
creatures possibly do?!

85
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,070
Fool! You're not worth Arlong's time!

86
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,770
He'll be more than enough!

87
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,480
No!

88
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,260
It's coming!

89
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,530
What the... What the...
What's going on?!

90
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,620
The whole lot of you
will be food for him!

91
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,580
Come out, Momoo!

92
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,280
A-A monster!

93
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,680
It's the Grand Line monster that
destroyed the town of Gosa!

94
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,780
It's here!

95
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,890
T-That's...

96
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,250
...the sea cow, Momoo!

97
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,880
Oh, it's him?

98
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,580
He's a friend of the fishmen?

99
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,020
Wait! Momoo! Where are you going?!

100
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,650
Hey! Stop! Get back here! Momoo!

101
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,610
Momoo. What are you doing?

102
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,090
Though, if you wanna
run away, I won't stop you.

103
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Understand, Momoo?

104
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,560
It's coming! It's coming!

105
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,740
Alright!

106
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,100
Follow after Momoo!

107
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,240
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

108
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,480
I'll do it! This is a waste of time!

109
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,120
What's he planning now?!

110
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,560
I don't get a very good
feeling about this...

111
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,650
His arms stretched!

112
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,090
He has a Devil Fruit power?!

113
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,250
What?!

114
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,240
Who cares?

115
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,160
Go!

116
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,120
Whoa! Run!

117
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,090
What? What's he doing?!

118
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,070
I dunno, but it doesn't look good!

119
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,570
Gum-Gum...

120
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,050
...Pinwheel!

121
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,210
I didn't come here
to take on these guys!

122
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,190
The one I wanna beat up...

123
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,110
...is you!

124
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,150
That's perfect, then.

125
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,310
I was just thinking of killing you now.

126
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,020
That was dangerous, you!

127
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,440
Are you trying to kill us, too?!

128
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,730
Huh?

129
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,850
What destructive power...

130
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,520
I can't believe a human exists
who can throw that giant beast!

131
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,680
Is this battle of this world?

132
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,460
Huh?

133
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,500
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

134
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,930
What are you doing?!

135
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,500
Huh?

136
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,390
How dare you hurt our brothers?!

137
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,280
It would seem we need to fight, too.

138
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,430
Looks like we need to teach them
the differences between our species.

139
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,390
The main forces finally show up, huh?

140
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,910
Arlong-san. Please stay there quietly.

141
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,860
If you go on a mad rampage,
you'll tear all of Arlong Park into pieces.

142
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,300
We'll take care of these guys!

143
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,820
Yeah. Do as you wish.

144
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,420
Yikes!

145
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,280
Hey. Hey, there. There's something I...

146
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,350
That octopus is up to something.

147
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,150
Octopus is best with
a little salt and sliced up.

148
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,330
Add some olive oil and paprika
and it's a perfect snack while drinking.

149
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,810
Hey, I'm kind of in trouble. Hear me out.

150
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,030
Take this! Zero vision!

151
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,310
Hachi Ink Jet!

152
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,490
You idiot! Why didn't you dodge?!

153
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,460
I can't see!

154
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,250
Now to finish you off!

155
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,170
Hey, Luffy! Run!

156
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,180
Yeah, that's the problem.

157
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,520
I can't seem to move!

158
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,400
Huh?!

159
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,020
M-My feet are stuck!

160
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,350
You're the one who
stuck them in the ground!

161
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,600
Why does he have to be so--

162
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,740
Hachi Ink Jet on the Rocks!

163
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,530
What a pain.

164
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,970
Sanji! Great! Great!

165
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,130
Seems I've wound up following
one hell of an idiot of a captain.

166
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,690
Agreed.

167
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,600
He's... awesome!

168
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,170
But he's 100 times better than
a damn gang that'd hurt a lady.

169
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,260
Lady?

170
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,390
To think you'd bust in here
just for that one lousy girl.

171
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,670
You really know how to make us laugh!

172
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,430
Lousy girl?

173
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,730
Just try and insult
Nami-san one more time.

174
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,640
I'll use a buttered frying pan to
turn you into meuniere, Fish Man!

175
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,800
You seem somewhat
skilled for a human.

176
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,370
Any sort of chivalry from a
pirate is obviously half-hearted.

177
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,750
Go ahead and see if my
chivalry is half-hearted or not.

178
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,400
I was raised by an unbeatable
pirate for half my life.

179
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,080
It appears you don't know the
true level of the fishman species.

180
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,210
Oof! Oof!

181
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,000
They're still really stuck.

182
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,960
Still?! They're still stuck?!

183
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,180
Yep, they're still stuck.

184
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,950
I get the feeling just pulling
me won't get them unstuck.

185
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,440
Are you even trying?! Are you
even trying to pull your legs out?!

186
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,400
What're they playing
around in Arlong Park for?

187
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,310
I'll kill them!

188
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,300
Hey, you! Get unstuck already!

189
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,930
Get back here!

190
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,140
Hey, octopus.

191
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,610
They're busy right now.

192
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,570
I'll take you on.

193
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,210
Roronoa Zoro! Yeah! I forgot!

194
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,390
How dare you trick me!

195
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,890
Yeah! And you cut down
tons of my brothers!

196
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm not interested in these old stories.

197
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,090
It doesn't matter what reasons
you have for wanting to kill me.

198
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,050
The situation's changed now!

199
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,270
You're not trying to destroy us.

200
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,710
We're trying to destroy you!

201
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,780
A-Alright, Zoro!
That octopus is all yours! Nice!

202
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,120
Luffy!

203
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,030
I'm back...

204
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,740
Why, you...

205
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,180
My bad...

206
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,130
Seems you really do
want me to kill you.

207
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,970
Wasn't that the guy
who saved Gen-san?

208
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,980
You're the people
from Cocoyashi Village!

209
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,040
Oh?

210
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,960
Judging from the fact that you have
weapons, I take it this is a rebellion?

211
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,390
Then you're all--

212
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,130
Exploding Star!

213
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,430
Big Bro Usopp!

214
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,340
You're dealing with me!

215
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,300
If you wanna die that badly,
I'll get rid of you right now!

216
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,650
Just who is that lad?

217
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,310
He's brave one minute,
then runs away the next.

218
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,430
He's a baffling man...

219
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,320
Get back here, Nose!

220
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,350
Well, you got a big mouth!

221
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,910
Why are these people pirates?!

222
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,210
You're all pathetic. Move.
I'm sick of watching this.

223
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,680
Arlong-san! We asked you
not to go on a rampage!

224
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,120
I won't. I just thought up a fun game.

225
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,100
Game?

226
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm going to beat you up!

227
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,030
Do you really think you can beat us?

228
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,980
So what if we do?

229
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,440
We do, stupid-head! Let go!

230
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,410
Sounds like he has something to say.

231
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,850
What the... What the...

232
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,760
People with Devil Fruit
powers can't swim!

233
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,940
Though, even people without
powers would sink in this situation!

234
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,660
He's gonna throw him into the sea?!

235
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,680
Gum-Gum Pistol!

236
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,060
Oww!

237
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,130
Fool.

238
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,530
Darn you!

239
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,480
How pointless.

240
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,160
Luffy!

241
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,620
Damn you!

242
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm coming to save...

243
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,600
Idiot! Don't get worked up!

244
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,100
They want us to go in the water!

245
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,840
The fishmen'd obviously have
the advantage in an underwater fight!

246
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,850
There's only one way to save Luffy!

247
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,220
Take these guys down in an
instant, then go into the water?

248
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,850
Let's do it! There's no time!

249
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,490
Yeah!

250
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,590
Just how many seconds
will Rubber Man hold out?

251
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,510
Oh, so that's the game?

252
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,850
I see.

253
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,560
You can have the fish.

254
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,350
You can cut and trim the octopus.

255
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,630
This is bad... I'm out of strength...

256
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,790
What do we do?!
He can't help himself now!

257
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,580
Big Bro Luffy's going to die!

258
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,490
To think they can't
even breathe underwater...

259
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,830
Humans are utterly pitiful creatures!

260
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,790
Bring it on! I challenge you, Octo-Man!

261
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,390
Game! Game!

262
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,810
I'll take care of you in five seconds!

263
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,860
No, three seconds!

264
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,060
Don't be in such a rush.

265
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,870
No matter what happens, none of
you have any hope of surviving!

266
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,660
Hachi Ink Jet!

267
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,040
Hang on, Luffy!

268
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,010
I-I'm gonna be killed!

269
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

270
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

271
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

272
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

273
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

274
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

275
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

276
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

277
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

278
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

279
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

280
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,210
I-I can't breathe!

281
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,280
You damn octopus!
I don't care about you!

282
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,970
I gotta hurry and save Luffy!

283
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,520
Hey! Are the wounds
you got from Hawk-Eye...

284
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,930
Shut up! I can't afford to faint here!

285
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,890
Wait, is running all I do?

286
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,320
On the next episode of One Piece!

287
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,430
"Luffy Submerged!
Zoro vs. Hatchan the Octopus"

288
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
