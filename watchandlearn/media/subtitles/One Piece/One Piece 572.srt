00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:07,380
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,860
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,600
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,110
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,280
where they instigated an all-out war
against the New Fish-Man Pirates,

78
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,450
who were holding a grudge against humans
and looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom.

79
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,540
Luffy finally defeated Hordy, the captain of
the New Fish-Man Pirates, in a fierce fight

80
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,760
and thwarted his plot. However...

81
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,880
Have it your way, instead
of the Fish-Man Island,

82
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,970
I'll have my vengeance against you all!

83
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,980
Monkey D. Luffy. I know your name now.

84
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,230
Come to the New World!

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,260
Sure, wait for me there.

86
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,400
There's some business I want
to settle with you, too.

87
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,910
I can't leave it in your
hands - that's too dangerous!

88
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,120
I'll kick your ass all over the New World...

89
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,340
...and make the Fish-Man Island my territory!

90
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,100
You insolent brat!

91
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:57,060
"Many Problems Lie Ahead! A Trap
Awaiting in the New World!"

92
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,150
--Here you go.
--Oh, thank you!

93
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,360
It's kelp tea - a special
product of the Fish-Man Island.

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,740
It aids in digestion so do
your stomach a favor with it.

95
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,750
It's good! How thoughtful of
you, Minister of the Right!

96
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,130
You are treating us most graciously
- I hope we're not imposing!

97
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,710
No, no!

98
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,800
There are no words to express
my thanks to you all, so...

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,220
We have to say goodbye to this island soon.

100
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,770
Do not mention saying goodbye, "Nose"pp-sama!

101
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,520
No, don't cry! I'm sorry!

102
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,470
And my name is Usopp.

103
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,820
Oh, where did Franky go?

104
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,950
He left to learn how to operate the ship.

105
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,870
Seems like  he needs to learn
a little trick to ascend.

106
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,580
So... this is the list of treasures
that were stolen from the chamber.

107
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,140
There are so many! The Tamate Box, again...

108
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,840
Tamate Box?

109
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,680
IN THE VICINITY OF THE CANDY FACTORY TOWN

110
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,850
Damn Straw Hat!

111
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,180
I can't believe he kicked me out!

112
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,480
But,

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,480
I have so much treasure in my belly.

114
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm gonna buy, like, 100 pirate ships and
kill the Straw Hats in the New World...

115
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,040
T-T-The treasure!

116
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,830
It's all gone!

117
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,450
I can't even buy a hard candy now!

118
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,630
Oh my treasure-chan!

119
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,540
Where is it?!

120
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,890
How is everything-jamon, Jimbei?

121
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,230
Are the members of the
Sun Pirates doing well?

122
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,070
Yes. In fact, they have too much energy
and they are a bit out of control.

123
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,750
But I cannot believe they accepted it.

124
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,740
Even I was surprised when
I heard about it-jamon.

125
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,800
I had never expected the Sun
Pirates becomes Big Mam's allies.

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,590
Is it going well?

127
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,810
I have to say that while she is not a
reasonable person she lets us

128
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,130
do what we like.

129
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,190
Well, I was worried because it must be hard

130
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,540
for a man like you to work under somebody...

131
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,770
...other than Fisher Tiger.

132
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,550
You don't have to worry.

133
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,250
I don't mind working for someone.

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,980
Plus, in the New World,

135
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,140
the best you can do to protect your crew is

136
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,240
ally yourself with one of the Four Emperors.

137
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,040
Oh yeah? It seems to me like you

138
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,710
are doing it for the benefit
of the Fish-Man Island.

139
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,110
Even after Whitebeard's death,

140
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,280
this island remained safe under
Big Mam's name because you

141
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,720
connected us to her.

142
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,990
No, it's just a coincidence.

143
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,470
We are supposed to protect the island

144
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,310
but we are wanted pirates so...

145
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,810
However, Your Majesty!

146
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,610
I am thinking about breaking
away from Big Mam.

147
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,860
Oh, are you going to accept
Luffy-kun's invitation?

148
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,660
Hey, Jimbei.

149
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,390
Join...

150
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,580
...my crew!

151
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,880
Yes. I've made up my mind.

152
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,630
But the pirates' world is all
about obligation and honor.

153
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,630
Our contracts are made by exchanging cups of

154
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,680
sake and a verbal agreement - no documents.

155
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,520
So we have to be really determined
when we terminate a contract.

156
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,600
My concern is that there is a chance

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,550
that Big Mam will turn her
anger toward this island.

158
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,780
Boy... You do not have to feel responsible
for everything-jamon, Jimbei.

159
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,040
If that is going to happen,
so be it. I have a plan-jamon.

160
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,080
We just welcomed 70 thousand rowdy

161
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,400
fellows as new soldiers from
the Fish-Man District today.

162
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,420
So do not worry about us-jamon.

163
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,270
And if we lose Big Mam's
Jolly Roger as protection,

164
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,890
there is another one that I want to use!

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,480
A skull with a straw hat on-jamon.

166
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,880
I see! I like that Jolly Roger too!

167
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,790
King-sama!

168
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,330
W-W-We have a problem!

169
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,750
King-sama!

170
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,590
What is it, Minister of the Right?
Why are you in such a rush?

171
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,840
I just remembered something serious!

172
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,850
Relating to giving all the treasures
to Luffy-kun and the others.

173
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,230
If they find them, could you to
tell them to return the Tamate Box!

174
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,130
What are you saying?!

175
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,650
I will not tell them to return
something I already gave them!

176
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,990
But...

177
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,410
What?! It will explode if someone opens it?!

178
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,740
Why did you rig it with explosives?

179
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,000
Well...

180
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,450
After the contents of the Tamate
Box were stolen 10 years ago,

181
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,390
I thought, in case another thief
comes, we have to teach him a lesson.

182
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,550
So we set up a box-full of explosives
to explode when someone opens it.

183
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,770
Since I am in charge of the treasure
chamber and the Tamate Box...

184
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,400
All right. All right.

185
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,680
If Luffy-kun and the others
come back with the treasures,

186
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,610
give them the reason and ask
them to return it to us.

187
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,500
I am sorry.

188
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,770
But what if they open it
before they get here...

189
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,920
That is my concern, too.

190
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,370
King-sama, Minister of the Right!
Luffy-sama and the others just came back.

191
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,840
Oh, so they are okay?!

192
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,590
I am so relieved. I guess I
was just worrying too much.

193
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,210
What?!

194
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,640
All the treasures?!

195
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,310
To Big Mam?!

196
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,770
You gave them away?!

197
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,650
She said she was gonna destroy the
island if she couldn't get her sweets!

198
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,010
Can you believe how crazy she is?! I mean
- if it were meat, I could understand!

199
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,490
But don't worry!

200
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,070
I really stood up to her!

201
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,950
You stood up to one of the Four Emperors?!

202
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,080
You talked back to Big Mam?!

203
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,990
Wow! You are so tough, Luffy-sama!

204
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,170
That's not the point!

205
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,380
"Nose"pp-sama is scary!

206
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,700
My name is Usopp!

207
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,090
Okay, I'm sorry!

208
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,190
Boy, that's not good.

209
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,060
I have to break away from Big
Mam before it gets complicated.

210
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:41,560
You guys should not do anything
to make Big Mam angrier!

211
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,770
We won't! We're all gonna get killed
since she's one of the Four Emperors!

212
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,120
Hey, this is pretty bad,
Minister of the Right!

213
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,910
I can't believe it!

214
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,990
If they gave the Tamate Box to Big
Mam and if she opens it herself,

215
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,370
she will take it as Luffy-kun's
challenge to her!

216
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,760
That is a big problem-jamon!

217
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,750
Well, he had no choice though.

218
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,010
What's done is done.

219
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,990
I guess it was a tit-for-tat situation
so you couldn't help fighting with her.

220
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,640
You're right! No matter who she was, I'd...

221
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,570
Nami-san...

222
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,570
Why...

223
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,520
...did you give all the treasures away?!

224
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,500
That's what you're focused on?!

225
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,290
--I'll punch you!
--You already did!

226
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,340
All right! Leff's go thew the New World!

227
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,700
We have no future ahead of us!

228
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,140
This is it! We're doomed!

229
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,350
Meanwhile, near the Candy Factory...

230
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,900
Dammit! Somebody took all the
treasures before I knew it!

231
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,400
Who did this? I'm gonna
kill him at any price!

232
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,680
With a mountain of treasures

233
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,490
and the secret of the Mermaid
Princess as presents,

234
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,780
I know that person will like me!

235
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,580
Oh, a crowd!

236
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,460
Who are those two carrying heavy loads?

237
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,410
Straw Hat Luffy! How dare he challenge Mama!

238
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,420
Mama must be really mad-soir.

239
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,800
I wonder what's going to happen-vous plait.

240
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,220
The tea party is 4 days from now.

241
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,370
Let's stop by at some island and
get something really sweet. Grr!

242
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,600
We have to ease her anger
even if just a little bit.

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,480
I think that's the best we can do-soir.

244
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,190
Luckily, we have so many
treasures-vous plait.

245
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,040
Those are my treasures! I'm sure!

246
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,120
Who the hell are they?!
I will bury them alive!

247
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,160
I stole those treasures!
Give them back to me!

248
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,540
--That's...
--He looks familiar to me. Grr!

249
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,460
Oh, here he is!

250
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,010
His name is "Wet-Haired"
Caribou. A rising rookie.

251
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,680
Oh, he's got a 200 million berry bounty.

252
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,010
H-He's worth 200 million berries?

253
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,230
It's too late to beg for your life!

254
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,850
Swamp-Swamp...

255
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,830
...Gatling Gun!

256
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,240
I'll fill you with holes!

257
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,140
Mr. Pekoms!

258
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,940
What is that?!

259
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,630
A turtle?

260
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,600
You're a Devil Fruit eater!

261
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,310
Of course I am!

262
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,140
But you're just Zoan type, aren't you?

263
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,320
Drop dead!

264
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:35,400
Logia Devil Fruit eaters who think
they're invincible often die young.

265
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Half-boiled challengers
always disappoint me-soir.

266
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,620
Let's go home-bon, Pekoms. Mama is waiting.

267
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,750
He beat a guy with a 200 million
bounty in a single blow!

268
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,250
As I recall, Mr. Pekoms has
a 330 million berry bounty.

269
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,130
Over 300 million?

270
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,430
That is how strong the pirate group led
by the one of the Four Emperors can be?

271
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,350
Will Luffy-san and the others be okay?

272
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,160
We are totally heroes now!

273
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,000
There's the Sunny!

274
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,290
Franky's there!

275
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,520
Looks like he's ready to go!

276
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,340
Hey, Franky!

277
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,260
Here we go finally!

278
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,420
Meanwhile, on the sea near the
Red Line in the New World...

279
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,120
An urgent report from the headquarters!

280
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,660
Several coated ships are emerging
from the seafloor at high speed!

281
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,120
Everyone, man your posts now!

282
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,940
I repeat!-- Everyone, man your posts now!

283
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,300
That's...!

284
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,140
A-A pirate ship!

285
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,580
Fire!

286
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,840
Hurry up! There's one more at two o'clock!

287
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,180
Pirate ships are emerging one after another!

288
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
What's going on?

289
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,210
Don't try to gain her favor like that!

290
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,800
Shut up! Go away!

291
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,330
I just got freed from hell at
last! I don't wanna die here!

292
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,410
Here comes a big one!

293
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,580
The captain is in danger!

294
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm gonna embrace her to keep her safe!

295
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,300
Let me take that important task!

296
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,130
Hey!

297
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,340
Not again!

298
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,030
Nice! That's my Captain-chan!

299
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,370
What beautiful swordplay!

300
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,030
It's not just the swordplay that's beautiful!

301
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,490
You guys, be serious!

302
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,160
You all know how to ward off bombshells!

303
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,280
If you don't use that skill
now, when are you gonna...

304
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,200
Captain, you're talking to a mast!

305
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,520
I cleaned your glasses!

306
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,720
Thank you.

307
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,630
She's so cute! She's like
a flower in the filthy G-5!

308
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,140
I will die for you, Captain-chan!

309
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,480
Me too! Me too!

310
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,550
We're in a battle! Stop fooling around!

311
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,020
Otherwise, you'll get killed!

312
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm sick of the G-5!

313
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,930
NAVY GRAND LINE 5TH BRANCH
"G-5" CAPTAIN--TASHIGI

314
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,930
I can't believe you guys are Navy soldiers!

315
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,510
Don't take me lightly
just because I'm a woman!

316
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,500
We're not taking you lightly!

317
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,570
We're just falling for Captain
Tashigi's cuteness...

318
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,920
There! You're taking me lightly!

319
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
You have to realize that you're Navy...

320
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,860
Shut up, Tashigi!

321
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm interrogating someone here.

322
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,700
I'm sorry, sir!

323
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,930
I see.

324
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,000
So you all were captured by Hordy
Jones, a pirate from the seafloor.

325
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,610
That explains why

326
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,380
there was no rookie passing by
the Fish-Man Island for a month.

327
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,140
Captured? No, he enslaved us!

328
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,620
But when Hordy and his clan started a civil
war, a group of pirates defeated them

329
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,270
and freed us!

330
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,980
A group of pirates?

331
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,130
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
tell you who they were!

332
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,160
Idiot! Just tell them!

333
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,740
They're not just Navy
soldiers - they're the G-5!

334
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,980
They'd fish for sharks using a pirate as bait

335
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,660
or make a bonfire using pirates as kindling!

336
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,900
They're the Navy's craziest outlaws

337
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,500
who won't even obey orders
from the headquarters!

338
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,690
You have no idea what they're gonna do to us!

339
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,510
And of all men, we were...

340
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,940
...caught by the infamous
"White Chase" Smoker!

341
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,930
NAVY GRAND LINE 5TH BRANCH "G-5" VICE ADMIRAL

342
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,770
"WHITE CHASE" SMOKER

343
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,730
Vice Admiral Smoker! Can I take them?

344
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,990
No, don't!

345
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,520
I'll tell you! So help me!

346
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,840
The group of pirates who beat
Hordy and his clan was...

347
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,570
...the Straw Hats!

348
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,990
I know.

349
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,120
Fool!

350
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,290
With both excitement and uncertainty...

351
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,960
...the journey to the New
World is finally underway.

352
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,340
The Straw Hats acquire a new Log Pose...

353
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,680
...and say their goodbyes
to Shirahoshi and Jimbei.

354
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,350
To fulfill his promise to Shanks...

355
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,660
...Luffy finally sets off...

356
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,140
...on a new voyage.

357
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,570
On the next episode of One Piece!

358
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,490
"Finally Time to Go!
Goodbye, Fish-Man Island!"

359
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
