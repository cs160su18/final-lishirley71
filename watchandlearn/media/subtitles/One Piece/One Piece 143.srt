2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,740
"And So, the Legend Begins!
To the Other Side of the Rainbow"

20
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,720
Father, it's an even bigger
harvest than we anticipated.

21
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,830
Take it! Take every last bit of treasure in here!

22
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,030
Charge!

23
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,200
Guys!

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,540
Don't do anything crazy!

25
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,680
This is the Pumpkin Pirates' territory!

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Until Rapa Nui gets back,
it's up to us to defend it!

27
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,500
Professor!

28
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm one of the Pumpkin Pirates, too!
I'll fight alongside you!

29
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,020
I'll help you out, Pops!

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,660
Professor!

31
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,510
They got me!

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,890
How come you guys are having
trouble against those kids?!

33
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,430
W-Wetton...!

34
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,750
He's still his same, young self!

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,660
No, you see, I'm Grandpa
Wetton's grandson, Lake.

36
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,790
Do I really look like him?

37
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,310
Yeah, a dead ringer.

38
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,420
I am, huh? My grandpa was
as handsome as I am, was he?

39
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,320
What's with him?

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,380
He's a weirdo.

41
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,990
You guys hand over your
treasure, nice and easy!

42
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,850
If you refuse, I'll burn you to a
crisp with this electroshock suit!

43
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,120
Watch out! He uses electricity!

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,320
Heh! Electricity, huh?

45
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,150
And here I was just itching
to wreak a little havoc, too!

46
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,280
I'll take your electricity, and cut
it clean in half with my sword!

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,950
No, electricity doesn't work that way.

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,910
This will be interesting. Just try it.

49
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,550
I was hoping you'd say that.

50
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,970
It's quiet, huh?

51
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,990
Yeah. Quiet.

52
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,700
Do you think everyone's all right?

53
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,660
Who knows?

54
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,720
"Who knows?" You can't say that!

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,970
Aren't you concerned about everyone?!

56
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,340
They don't need our concern.

57
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,830
Instead, I'm concerned about that
damn mayor coming back alive.

58
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,690
Huh?

59
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,370
If Luffy and the others take
care of that damn mayor,

60
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,150
then I won't be able to get him back.

61
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,990
Oh. I guess there is that.

62
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,400
Coming?

63
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,650
Yeah. Let's go.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,560
Gum-Gum... Rocket!!

65
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,360
What was that?

66
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,800
Whoo, we stopped.

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,450
C-Captain!

68
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,350
Y-You've got some nerve,

69
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,900
coming into the Rainbow Mist
without my permission!

70
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,180
You have to pay the 50 million-Berry
"entering on your own" tax!

71
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,700
No way.

72
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,990
What?!

73
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,190
Are you saying you won't
follow Wetton-sama's orders?!

74
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,370
Wetton? That's you?!

75
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,300
That's right. I am the grand, puffed-up
mayor of all of Luluka, Wetton!

76
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,460
What? You, who were once
a pirate, are now the mayor?!

77
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,360
What, is that so wrong?

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,800
C-Captain! That's him!
He's the one who stole our ship!

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,410
What?

80
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,950
Y-You're that kid from back then?

81
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,530
You, the one who burned down
the town, are now the mayor?!

82
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't accept it! No way do I accept this!

83
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,260
You shut your mouth!

84
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,940
Rapa Nui!

85
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,510
Kid, being the mayor is nice.
I'm able to stay at my desk,

86
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,930
and rake in the money I swindle
from all the foolish citizens.

87
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,120
I don't have to wander the
seas in search of my prey,

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,320
or get hunted down by the navy!
Every day is a carefree paradise.

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,490
There's no other trade as easy as this!

90
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,830
Once you are reborn, you too
will obtain power, as I did.

91
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,970
There's no use going on being a petty pirate!

92
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,680
Shut up!

93
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,610
Captain!

94
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,180
Father!

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,150
Why, you...! What are you doing?!

96
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,210
You don't know what a real pirate is.

97
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,190
What?

98
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,780
Luffy...

99
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,780
We don't need power.
We pirates have a dream, after all.

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,080
A-A dream, you say?

101
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,790
My electroshock suit is invincible!
You cannot escape from it!

102
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,840
Escape? Who, me?

103
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,470
I told you, I'm gonna cut that
electricity of yours in half!

104
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,220
Like I said, where's the sense
in trying to cut electricity?!

105
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,390
Shall I cut it?

106
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,670
Take this! Rolling Thunder!!

107
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,360
Huh? What's going on here?!

108
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,950
That suit he's so proud of
doesn't seem to be of much use

109
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,760
once the plug is pulled.

110
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,120
Damn it! How can this happen?!
Put it back! Put it back, you bastard!

111
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,320
You jackass! That's no fair!

112
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,770
Help me! I'm sinking! I'm sinking!
Ah, I can't open the top!

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,770
Let me cut something...!

114
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,640
A dream, you say? What is it? Tell me!

115
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,140
Everyone knows what your dream is.

116
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,180
You just want to obtain
riches of gold and silver.

117
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,350
That will come falling into your lap
on its own, if you have power.

118
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:59,330
A pirate's dream is to be
the greatest man on the seas.

119
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,980
I'm the man who will be king of the pirates!

120
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,530
Luffy...

121
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,230
Damn...

122
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,600
No one has ever defied me and lived!

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,280
I'll blow you away, right down to your bones!

124
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,530
Wait, Captain!

125
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,440
Father, what about me?!

126
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,840
What do I care?!

127
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,720
Captain!

128
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,180
What is that? What's going on?

129
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,970
Rainbow Tower...!

130
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,180
It's collapsing...

131
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,590
Damn it, what's going on?

132
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,540
He's abandoned us!

133
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:07,470
Wetton, you bastard! You're not
the captain anymore, dammit!

134
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,140
Luffy!

135
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,630
Rapa Nui!

136
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,330
It's Rapa Nui!

137
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,660
He came back!

138
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,610
Thank goodness! Rapa Nui!

139
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,550
He had me so worried!

140
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,260
Man, how big a pain can one guy be?

141
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,380
W-What's that?

142
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,290
It can't be...!

143
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,350
Professor?

144
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,950
Ape's Concert was maintained in
a delicate balance to begin with.

145
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,950
If you set off a large
explosion in a place like this,

146
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,330
there's no telling what might happen!

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,670
What is that?!

148
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,630
The warping of space is expanding quickly!

149
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,970
At this rate, we'll be caught in it,
and all of us will croak!

150
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,930
What?!

151
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,210
How could this happen? Rainbow Tower...

152
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,510
...has completely sunk.

153
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,580
Damn, as unfinished as it was,
it wasn't reinforced enough.

154
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,140
But no matter.

155
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,940
Now, my men won't be coming
after me. The treasure is all mine!

156
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,710
The sky is falling in!

157
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,780
There's not much time. An hour, maybe.

158
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,070
This is bad! We have to get out of here!

159
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,020
But how?

160
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,910
The author of this book
once visited Ape's Concert.

161
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,260
The way out must be written
in here somewhere, too.

162
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,160
What's wrong?

163
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,850
"Continued in the last volume."

164
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,530
And where is that?

165
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,790
You don't have it?!

166
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,910
What's that?

167
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,560
Huh? What's the matter?

168
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,390
Luffy, that light!

169
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,810
That's the light of the sun...
the light of the setting sun!

170
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,810
Setting sun?

171
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah. The light of the sun is
shining in through a crack in space!

172
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,070
We followed that light, and got outside.

173
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,070
R-Really?!

174
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,800
Hurry! That light could disappear at any time!

175
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,240
Unfurl the sails! Everyone,
man the oars as hard as you can!

176
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,080
Hey, you guys come on, too! Give us a hand!

177
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,230
We're getting out of here!

178
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,970
Y-Yeah...

179
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,070
Hey, what are you doing?! Row right!

180
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,820
We are, you know!

181
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,600
Ah, they broke!

182
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,590
What are you doing?!

183
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,070
Damn, not good!

184
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,590
Hey, this is bad! The light
is starting to disappear!

185
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,780
So, this is the end...

186
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,610
You guys get off and push us from behind!

187
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,350
Don't be crazy!

188
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,970
No, if we all flutter kick, then maybe we...

189
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,680
We will not!

190
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,650
If only we could get a tailwind to blow us...

191
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,610
You just need the wind to blow, right?

192
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,320
Hold on! What are you gonna do?!

193
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,350
Blow up our ship!

194
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,440
It was originally a navy ship, after all.

195
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,500
It's fully loaded with
cannonballs. If we light those,

196
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
it should give you a fairly powerful tailwind.

197
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
You can't!

198
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,060
Wait, Rapa Nui! If you do that, what...

199
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,210
...what will happen to you?!

200
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,880
This is my treasure! Mine! This is
why I can't give up being mayor!

201
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,870
Hey, our friends were
supposedly inside that mist.

202
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,820
What happened? Don't tell me
you're the only one who came back.

203
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,420
How about it?!

204
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,160
Hey, hold it!

205
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,010
Rapa Nui!

206
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,080
Hey, guys! Where are you going?! Come back!

207
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,550
We are the Pumpkin Pirates!

208
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,540
We're friends, who swore we'd
stay together until we died!

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
Guys...

210
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,190
Rapa Nui dove in to save you guys!

211
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,080
Don't let what he's done be for nothing!

212
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,150
Are you all trying to get killed together?!

213
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,110
We're not going to die!

214
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,260
Henzo, I promise, we're coming back!

215
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,270
No matter how many years it takes,
we're coming back to Luluka!

216
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,720
Isoka...

217
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,760
D-Don't you go thinking that you
won't answer for striking the mayor!

218
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,760
You'll have to pay the "hitting the
mayor" tax of 90 million Berries!

219
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,220
Are you okay with that?

220
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,670
It doesn't matter to me.

221
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,590
I'll just skip out on it, after all.

222
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,140
What? Paying taxes is a citizen's duty!

223
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,440
How is a pirate obligated to pay taxes?

224
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,270
Er, well...

225
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,160
Sanji!

226
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,000
The Rainbow Mist is disappearing!

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,440
What?

228
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,800
What will happen to Luffy and everyone else?

229
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,380
Now, none of them can come back! Not ever!

230
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:28,160
No matter how hard you guys try,
my power is unshakable!

231
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,260
Hm? What's that?!

232
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,650
What?!

233
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,730
What the...?!

234
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,200
The Merry!

235
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,150
Are those guys all right?

236
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,530
Aah! My mansion!

237
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,450
All of my possessions are being carried away!

238
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,180
Guys!

239
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,180
Nami-san!

240
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,820
Damn, how can this happen?!
My precious ship...!

241
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,600
Oh, Sanji, long time no see!

242
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,880
Nami-san!

243
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,510
What was that for?!

244
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,440
Oh, man, am I annoyed!

245
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,460
Why, Nami-san?

246
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,780
All of the treasure she left
on deck got blown away.

247
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,150
Best not to get too close to her right now.

248
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,370
That's far enough, pirates!

249
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,530
--The navy!
--They're the same ones that were chasing us!

250
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,960
"Justice"

251
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,380
Help us! These guys are terrible criminals,

252
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,990
who have taken every last bit
of the mayor's property!

253
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,390
This is the ring of Princess Illusia,
a treasure which was stolen

254
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,560
by pirates a hundred years ago,
and has been missing ever since.

255
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,860
Why do you have this?

256
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,390
W-Well, you see...

257
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,540
You didn't steal it, did you?

258
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,070
No, of course not! This was a treasure
that was resting in Ape's Concert!

259
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,890
Yes, yes, we just pulled it out of a shipwreck!

260
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,860
I see. What you're saying is,
it doesn't belong to anyone.

261
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,600
What?!

262
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,510
Major, we've discovered a large pile of treasure

263
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,540
that we believe was carried out of there.

264
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,580
All right, the navy will be confiscating all of it.

265
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,090
Hold it! You're not laying
a finger on that treasure!

266
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,090
That treasure is mine!

267
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,290
Any treasure without an owner
belongs to the World Government.

268
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,920
If it has been embezzled, it will
be considered an act of piracy!

269
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,680
Fine with me! I'm a pirate to begin with!

270
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,930
Whatever I want, I take by force!

271
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,410
Watch out!

272
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,670
I will take that as your confession.

273
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,840
Is that okay with you, Wetton the pirate?

274
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,860
What?!

275
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,980
You couldn't be...

276
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,330
"Justice"

277
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,710
Rapa Nui...

278
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,040
You're kidding!

279
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,780
I promised that we'd come back, didn't I?

280
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,660
Isoka?!

281
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,720
Take all of Wetton's gang into custody.

282
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,510
Yes, sir.

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,490
You guys are all alive? B-But how?

284
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,740
At the moment of the explosion,
we were thrown into the outside world, too.

285
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,470
However, it was the world 50 years ago.

286
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,030
Sure enough, that mist warped
the axis of time, as well.

287
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,550
Then why didn't you come here sooner?

288
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,860
In order to defeat Wetton, who
abused the mantle of his authority,

289
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,710
I thought we would need to use another
authority-- the power of the navy.

290
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,400
But in order to gain that high
a rank, it took me a little time.

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,380
So that's it.

292
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,720
I may be wearing the uniform
of the navy, but in my heart,

293
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,380
I'm still a Pumpkin Pirate,
and Henzo, I'm your friend.

294
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,090
For now, and forever.

295
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,850
Rapa Nui...

296
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,740
Also, I forgot to mention this, Luffy Pirates,

297
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,270
but you're under arrest, too.

298
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,290
What?!

299
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,740
You're heartless!

300
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,200
Have you forgotten how you owe
me for feeding you, you jerk?!

301
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,750
As a member of the navy,
charged with upholding justice,

302
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,210
I can't just let a pirate who has
a bounty get away. However...

303
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,070
How can this be?! Right now, we have
to escort Wetton and his gang

304
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,420
back to Navy Headquarters! But if we do that,

305
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,860
the Luffy Pirates are going to
end up slipping away from us!

306
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,680
But they're just too much for us to handle!

307
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Request assistance from
the naval base at once!

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,350
No, it won't be until tomorrow or
the next day that they'll arrive!

309
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,850
If they escape during that time,
that's the end of it!

310
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,150
"Justice"

311
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,110
Aah, I give up! I can't do anything about it!

312
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,850
That sure sounded like a put-on.

313
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,890
We can't do any full-fledged repairs right away.

314
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,650
Those emergency measures should
at least keep the water out, though.

315
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,980
Thank you, Luffy, and all of your friends.

316
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,050
Now, the research that I carried
on all these years is at an end.

317
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,510
We can't have that.

318
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,390
There's no telling when the Rainbow
Mist is going to appear, right?

319
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,600
With that thing out there,
we can't go out to sea in peace.

320
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,820
We want you to make us some gear,

321
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,090
to help us avoid the Rainbow Mist.

322
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,770
That will be an easy task.

323
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,100
The Rainbow Mist is a land of eternity.

324
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,810
It has neither daytime, nor nighttime.

325
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,240
One never gets sick, or grows old.

326
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,580
The sea shines emerald, and the sky
envelops us deeply, like milk.

327
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,430
The countless ships that
become captives of this land

328
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,770
had immeasurable treasures
resting within them.

329
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,380
It was indeed the last
paradise remaining on earth.

330
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,110
We were the kings of that land of eternity.

331
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,110
We routed the pirates that came invading,

332
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,740
and kept the peace in paradise.
Our name was the Pumpkin Pirates.

333
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,450
I would like to write down
the many unusual adventures

334
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,950
we went through inside the mist...

335
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,570
...for the sake of the adventurers
who will visit this land hereafter.

336
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,100
The name of the adventurers belongs to those

337
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,710
whose debt we are in for
leading us back out into the world--

338
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,980
the Luffy Pirates.

339
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,950
Anyway, that sure was an interesting place.

340
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,820
Really? I've had enough of that ship graveyard!

341
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,070
Well, it's not like I wanna live there,
but I wanna visit from time to time.

342
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,120
Was it really that nice?

343
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,010
Hm? Rain?

344
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,740
It's... not rain...

345
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,080
Hail?

346
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,460
No... something's fall--

347
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:17,540
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

348
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:27,570
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

349
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,490
There are days where I almost lose to myself

350
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:51,930
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

351
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,050
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

352
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:08,420
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

353
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:17,270
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

354
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,390
This unique moment...

355
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,650
What's wrong?!

356
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,230
Our Log Pose is broken!
It's stuck pointing upwards.

357
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,700
What?!

358
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,590
That's not it.

359
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,320
It was updated by an island
with stronger magnetism.

360
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,550
If it's pointing up, it's a sky island.

361
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,460
Sky island?

362
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,000
Then, that ship fell from there?

363
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,740
On the next episode of One Piece!

364
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,400
"Caught Log! The King of Salvagers, Masira!"

365
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,750
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
