Put the pieces of our dreams together

and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,610
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,620
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

75
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,530
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,180
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,970
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,740
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law

79
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,470
who's been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,190
Meanwhile, at the Colosseum,

81
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,580
the final round of the competition is about to start.

82
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,840
All right! The final round starts soon!

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,340
It's going to be a battle royal of the five
including Diamante the hero!

84
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,800
A scramble for the Devil Fruit!
A death match involving the Fighting Fish!

85
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,250
Which one of them will win
the Flare-Flare Fruit?!

86
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,590
Everybody! We're going to
make a full-scale charge now!

87
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:24,410
Capture or scrap
Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hats-dara!

88
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,310
Let's see how much the Navy can do.

89
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm not gonna run or hide! So...

90
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,360
Let's have a big party, Navy!

91
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,130
She loves grapes - she's always eating them.

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,400
--So what?
--We're gonna use that against her.

93
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,290
Take a look at this!

94
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,890
This is a clump of Tatababasco Sauce,
the hottest spice in the world!

95
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,310
We made it look like a grape.

96
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,690
Don't tell me you're gonna let her eat it?!

97
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm gonna go and put this in to the basket!

98
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,140
I'm gonna go now!
Let's save all our friends!

99
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,190
Guys! You're too loud!

100
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,220
We will take back King Riku's kingdom!

101
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,330
"Dragon Claw Strikes!
Lucy's Intimidating Attack!"

102
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,640
THE UNDERGROUND TRADE PORT -
IN FRONT OF THE EXECUTIVE TOWER

103
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,720
With this world's hottest grape
made of Tatababasco Sauce,

104
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,910
I'm gonna knock Sugar out!

105
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,190
Here I come, Sugar!

106
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,600
I wonder what kind of guy he is,
the Executive of Doflamingo's clan!

107
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,370
I'm pretty sure he's strong.

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,300
What was that?!
Blasted a hole in the wall!

109
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,690
What was it?

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,730
This is...

111
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,030
There was a fly.

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,240
He shot down a fly?!

113
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,140
Unbelievable!
He shot down a fly behind him!

114
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,400
Who else would blast a hole in the wall
just to kill a fly?!

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,750
It means it was just a
casual attack for him?!

116
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,390
Let's not do this, Leo!
It's not too late!

117
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,470
He's totally ready and willing!

118
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,490
Leo, we'll be counting on you!

119
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,150
Uh-huh! Leave it up to me!

120
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,420
We'll carry through
Operation SOP at any cost!

121
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,420
Even if he can shoot a fly,
he can't shoot me because...

122
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,660
...I'm quicker!

123
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,530
So fast! I can't even see him!
Maybe, he can pull it off!

124
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,770
We'll take back our friends
who're being held captive!

125
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,690
--Go for it!
--Leo!

126
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,070
You can do it!

127
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,360
Please! Make it through!

128
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,430
Go!

129
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,300
Wait, Leo!

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,940
Robiland?!

131
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,060
There's another blood-thirsty
Fighting Fish jumping out!

132
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,580
It's going for Burgess!

133
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,230
Maybe he was off guard!
He isn't moving!

134
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,070
No, maybe he can't move!

135
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,140
Is he gonna fall victim
to the Fighting Fish?!

136
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,020
Shockwave...

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,560
...Elbow!

138
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,800
H-How powerful!

139
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,710
The whole Colosseum is shaking!

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,320
It blasted a massive hole
in the spectator area!

141
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,660
Burgess's terrific Shockwave Elbow!

142
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,310
The upstart pirate - Blackbeard!

143
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,250
The Ten Titanic Captains are supporting him!
And one of them is...

144
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,550
...Jesus Burgess!

145
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,130
--That bastard!
--Don't involve the audience!

146
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,410
How destructive!

147
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,070
There's another Fighting Fish
charging towards the ring!

148
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,690
That's...! Here it comes!

149
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,020
It's the "01" Fighting Fish
carrying the Devil Fruit!

150
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,590
There it is!

151
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,900
Is it going for Bartolomeo?!

152
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,180
Oh no, it's made a turn!

153
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,020
Who is it going for?!

154
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,740
Oh my, oh my! The other Fighting Fish are
surfacing one after another!

155
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,570
Is it going to be all-out battle between

156
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,650
the contenders in the ring and the Fighting Fish?!

157
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,560
These fish will never learn!

158
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,890
It's no use!

159
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,490
Charging at me?
You must be out of your mind!

160
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,760
They've come all at once!

161
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,630
I've no business with you!

162
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,570
I told you! It's no use!

163
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,230
Who is the "01" Fighting Fish targeting?!

164
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,250
Oh! It's going for Rebecca!

165
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,510
It is the survival of the fittest!

166
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,550
It's the mechanism of the natural world
that the weak fall prey first!

167
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,130
It must've set its sights on her
from the beginning!

168
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,540
I've gotta cut the chain at least!

169
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,940
Yes! I've got you!

170
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,150
You can't have it!

171
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,680
He wants a fight.

172
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,320
Here we go! The battle
between Lucy and Diamante!

173
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
Straw Hat!

174
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,090
I'm gonna fight you next!

175
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm gonna have the Flare-Flare Fruit!

176
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm gonna bring you down
along with that fish!

177
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,340
Burgess is gonna do it again!

178
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,010
--Run!
--He's gonna do it again!

179
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,470
How smart of you to stand behind me!

180
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,990
He's not gonna try to get away? Lucy!

181
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,820
Shockwave...

182
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,710
Dragon Claw!

183
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,010
Lucy!

184
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,730
Oh my, oh my! Burgess's armor
has shattered into pieces!

185
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,650
O-Only he could done that!
My great senpai!

186
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,050
They're not gonna just give up
the Flare-Flare Fruit, huh?

187
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,390
His fighting style has changed.

188
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,260
Is that really Straw Hat?

189
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,600
They're all in another league!

190
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,480
It's impossible for you
to win that competition!

191
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,140
You're gonna die!

192
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,040
Have courage to fight!

193
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,550
I've got to attack like I'm willing to kill!

194
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,020
Or I have no chance of winning!

195
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,260
Soldier-san, I am...

196
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,350
...going to do it!

197
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,410
--That's our commander!
--Alright! We're taking control of the lift now!

198
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,800
I guess you do have some fight in you.

199
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
What?! I know that voice!

200
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,250
You've hijacked the lift
and what are you gonna do now?

201
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,120
I will take down Doflamingo
and restore the King Riku dynasty!

202
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,000
That's ridiculous!

203
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,000
LAO G
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY
(THE DIAMANTE ARMY)

204
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,370
Commander!

205
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,600
You bastard!

206
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,570
Cub-san!

207
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,670
What has just happened?!

208
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,790
You fools!
You couldn't see what happened?

209
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,080
I'll tell you if you wanna know.

210
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,490
Commander!

211
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,880
You bastard!

212
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,840
That's what happened.

213
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,240
I didn't expect one of the Executives
to be in the lift!

214
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,540
When I was ordered to stand guard
at the entrance of the Toy House,

215
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,290
I happened to take the lift downwards and

216
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,780
waited ready at the entrance
of the underground trade port

217
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,760
but got on the lift again.
In other words, I...

218
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,810
...took the wron"g" lift!

219
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,610
There's "G"!

220
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,630
I won't let you reach the palace! Intruders!

221
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,070
No!

222
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,530
We must get there!

223
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,950
THE RAMPART TOWER B-1
LUFFY'S GROUP

224
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,310
A-Are you guys okay?

225
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,510
Yes, barely!

226
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,400
Hold on a sec! I'm gonna...

227
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,980
Gum-Gum...

228
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,480
...Storm!

229
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,770
--He's such a pain!
--Let me do it!

230
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,750
What?

231
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,210
What?!

232
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,540
What the hell is that?!

233
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,100
How annoying!

234
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,350
Three-Sword Style - 108 Pound Phoenix!

235
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,990
Gum-Gum...

236
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,280
...Gatling!

237
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,500
It's no use hitting those walls!

238
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,200
THE RAMPART TOWER B-2
KIN'EMON'S GROUP

239
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,960
The stairs that we were going down...

240
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,830
...suddenly bent upwards like
they're leading to the heavens!

241
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,160
Oh, that's good!

242
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,100
What are you talking about?!

243
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,080
We were heading to the Toy House underground!

244
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,410
We can't go any farther like this...

245
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,700
It's actually good we were stopped here!

246
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,170
What do you mean?

247
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,870
To get to the Toy House below,

248
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,010
we have to go up to the palace first

249
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,290
and then take the lift downwards.
That's the only way!

250
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,650
We have to go up in order to go down?!

251
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,090
It means we didn't have to split up
from Luffy and the others!

252
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,390
--No, we didn't!
--Why didn't you tell me?!

253
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,230
I tried to tell you many times!

254
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,970
--To go down...
--Stay inside!

255
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,370
You're my guide!

256
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,670
I wouldn't know what to do
if you fell out of there

257
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,230
while I was unaware!

258
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,240
You didn't listen to me!

259
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,460
You guys are all such blockheads,
jumping to conclusions!

260
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,570
What?! No, no!
We shouldn't be fighting here!

261
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,260
We have to go back now!

262
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,930
Wait! We have a problem!

263
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,160
Even if we can get to the lift in the palace,
the security is tight!

264
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,560
I'm sure I can get on but
since you're a Big Human...

265
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,600
So what if they couldn't figure out
who I truly was?

266
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,170
Poof!

267
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,700
What?!

268
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,070
Whaaat?!

269
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,520
THE TOY HOUSE - FRANKY

270
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,100
That was easy!

271
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,760
Why are you guys taking such a long time
to kill one guy-dara?

272
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,590
Finally, the big fish is coming in?!

273
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,480
Prepare yourself-dara!

274
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,800
That's our Bastille-san!

275
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,860
Huh?! Why is the Navy here?

276
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,990
What's going on?
Don't tell me it's over.

277
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,800
Super!

278
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,530
What?!

279
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,470
You can't take me down that easily!

280
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,790
You're so persistent!

281
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,940
It's my turn!

282
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,020
I'm gonna pay you back double!
Prepare for it!

283
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,370
Take this!

284
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,490
Coup de Vent!

285
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,460
We can't leave it to the Navy as I thought.

286
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,060
That's what I wanted to hear!
Can I do it?

287
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,020
Don't get so cocky!

288
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,900
What's your problem?!

289
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,210
Although he's just a robot,

290
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,810
he is a pervert, just as you are.

291
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,750
Be very careful.

292
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,750
What?

293
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,130
Oh, Señor! You're so hard-boiled!

294
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,460
Let's run away from the stone man!

295
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,750
He's not gonna go down easily!

296
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,320
We're trapped!

297
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,550
Luffy, take her and go on!

298
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,260
Leave him up to me!

299
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,830
You go ahead and kick Doflamingo's ass!

300
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,940
This stone guy…

301
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,960
…is gonna get cut!
