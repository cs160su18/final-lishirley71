00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210
If you want to go to the unbelievable world

It's not our way to worry

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

It’s important not to wake up

39
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,230
Since the day that the dream began

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,810
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,780
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:07,340
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,170
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:20,470
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,470
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,970
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,290
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,320
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,620
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,620
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:55,200
The Straw Hats find themselves caught up in
the turmoil and involved in an all-out war.

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,450
Now, Hordy's merciless plot puts the
Fish-Man Island in unprecedented danger!

81
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,240
My axe! Hit Hordy!

82
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,440
The Noah is falling!

83
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,700
Just in time!

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,830
The Fish-Man Island...

85
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,960
...is in danger!

86
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:44,970
"Luffy Loses the Fight?!
Hordy's Long-Awaited Revenge!"

87
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,570
So he's dead finally!

88
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,030
Now, Vander Decken's
power became ineffective

89
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,370
and the Noah will crash
into the Fish-Man Island!

90
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,740
Go to hell, Straw Hats!

91
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,770
And all those people who stand
in the way of our vengeance!

92
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,900
--The Fish-Man Island...
--...Will be no more!

93
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,150
We have to stop the ship somehow!

94
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,950
Straw Hat!

95
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,580
You wanna stop the Noah, don't
you? Then you have to beat me.

96
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Otherwise, you can't save
the Fish-Man Island!

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,130
You bastard!

98
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,500
If the Noah crashes into the Fish-Man
Island, it will be the end of everything.

99
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,040
Both the kingdom and the Noah's purpose

100
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,430
that has been protected
for hundreds of years!

101
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,380
Listen, my sons.

102
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,770
That ark - the Noah is not just
a relic from history-jamon.

103
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,350
Hundreds of years ago, a promise
was made to a great man

104
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,310
and that ship has been kept on the
seafloor until the appointed day comes.

105
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,980
The ship has not served
its purpose yet-jamon.

106
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,880
Now, we don't even know
how they made that ship.

107
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,340
The Noah cannot be damaged
until the day comes!

108
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,610
Understood, Father.

109
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,320
We will go and find out why
it moved and take care of it.

110
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,060
I have to save both the kingdom
and the Noah at any cost!

111
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,070
Straw Hat, you have neither
a strategy to stop the Noah

112
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,230
nor a chance to beat me!

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,780
What's the matter? If nothing is done,

114
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,850
your friends will have no choice

115
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,920
but to be swallowed by the sea,
along with the Fish-Man Island!

116
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,540
Were you fooling yourself when you said
you'd protect them all, Straw Hat?!

117
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,670
I will stop it!

118
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,510
I'm gonna break it to pieces
before it gets to the island!

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,010
You can't do that, Straw Hat!
Even if you could do so,

120
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,050
as I told you, the Noah has

121
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,770
a long history and will serve
a purpose in the future!

122
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,460
Then how can we save the island?!

123
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,920
We don't have time!

124
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,690
That's all I can think of!

125
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,830
Decken could still be alive.

126
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,780
If we can wake him up, maybe we
can change the course of the ship.

127
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,020
What if he's dead? Then what are
we gonna do? We gotta destroy it...

128
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,250
I said "Wait"!

129
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,940
Are you guys splitting? While you're arguing,

130
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,510
look, the Noah is falling towards the island!

131
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,970
Wait, Noah! There are people
who I love on the island!

132
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,460
Decken-sama! If you are alive,
please make it come after me!

133
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,040
Please don't harm the Fish-Man Island!

134
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,870
Drop dead now and watch it from beyond
the grave, as the Ryugu Kingdom falls!

135
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,120
Fish-Man Karate!

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,830
Shirahoshi!

137
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,080
Sea Drums!

138
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,380
Brother Mamboshi-sama!

139
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,550
Mamboshi!

140
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,720
It's your turn now!

141
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,330
Fish-Man Karate!

142
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,680
Hordy!

143
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,350
Straw Hat!

144
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,020
Second Gear!

145
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,980
Gum-Gum...

146
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,020
Luffy-sama!

147
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,860
...Jet Pistol!

148
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,000
Damn! I can defend myself
with the Armament Haki

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,460
but my Haki is not good enough
for these kind of attacks yet!

150
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,940
I shouldn't be fighting in the water.

151
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,930
In order to beat him, I need...

152
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,820
He wants to fight on the
falling ship, doesn't he?

153
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,240
But what he really wants is...

154
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,450
...the air on its deck!

155
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,420
If I could get in there, I can
beat Hordy with a single blow!

156
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,050
I knew he was going to do it!

157
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,050
Those bubbles are susceptible
to large gashes!

158
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,350
Damn! The air on the deck is gone!

159
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,100
It's so easy to render you humans helpless!

160
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,450
You should realize you're
no better than us Fish-Men!

161
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,370
Not only can you not stop the
Noah but you can't even beat me!

162
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,460
Drop dead, Straw Hat!

163
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,750
Gum-Gum...

164
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,180
...Snake Shot!

165
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,460
Screw you!

166
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,100
Do you think I'm stupid enough
to get hit by the same attack twice?

167
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,480
I wonder which comes first - your friends

168
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,810
being shattered to death
along with the island

169
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,150
or your last breath! Can't wait to see!

170
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,610
Oh no! He's gonna break my bubble again!

171
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,780
You dullard!

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,880
Luffy-sama!

173
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,290
Shirahoshi!

174
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,990
Brother Fukaboshi-sama!

175
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,090
Listen to me very carefully.

176
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,920
I want you to handle Straw Hat.

177
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,460
Handle Luffy-sama?

178
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,830
I'm going to stop Hordy at any cost!

179
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:50,270
You have to trust me no matter what
happens and stay close to the Noah!

180
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,600
No matter what happens! Understood?

181
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,730
Yes.

182
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,540
There's no way I can miss now!
Even with my eyes closed!

183
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,910
Oh no!

184
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,750
This is it!

185
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,060
Wh-What happened?

186
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,380
Luffy-sama.

187
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,110
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,520
Yowahoshi!

189
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,520
Brother Fukaboshi-sama asked me to do this.

190
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,430
Brother-hoshi!

191
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,820
Hordy! What's wrong with you?!

192
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,730
There are so many lives on
that island! How could you?

193
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,700
What's wrong with you?!

194
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,440
You three Princes are the
strongest in the Ryugu Kingdom?!

195
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,320
After all, you are sons
of that stupid Otohime.

196
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,940
She had no pride in being a
Fish-Man and died a dog's death

197
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,820
trying to become friendly with humans.

198
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,700
You three are worthless Princes who
can't even save your own country!

199
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,510
Brother-hoshi!

200
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,430
Brother Fukaboshi-sama!

201
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,310
Even your power is fake,

202
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,610
I admit that I couldn't fight back
because I'm not strong enough.

203
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,480
But there is still hope!

204
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,450
Merman Combat!

205
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,630
Ultramarine!

206
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,490
Don't you get it?!

207
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,540
You can't beat me with
those crappy attacks now!

208
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,800
Why, Hordy?!

209
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,160
What is it that you want
badly enough to sacrifice

210
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,840
so many innocent fellowmen's lives?!

211
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,350
How can you do such a horrible thing?!

212
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,260
Hordy! Ultra...

213
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,140
Shark Slicer!

214
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,970
...Marine!

215
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,520
Go to hell!

216
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,220
Brother Fukaboshi-sama!

217
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,940
How pathetic, you piss-poor Prince!

218
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,290
This power is a gift from heaven!

219
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,670
Now, it's your turn, you two.

220
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,540
Damn!

221
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,550
You can't beat me with that fake power!

222
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,470
Drop dead already!

223
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,600
Hordy, what's with you?!

224
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,260
You petitioned for vengeance against
the humans to Fish-Men, but now

225
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,030
you're trying to take those fellow
Fish-Men's lives along with the island!

226
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,370
You even abandoned the ones you grew
up with in the Fish-Man District!

227
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,370
Don't you realize what you are doing?!

228
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,930
Or is your hatred for humans so
deep that makes you lose your mind?

229
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,330
What happened to you?

230
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,730
Did humans beat you?!

231
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,150
Did humans kill your loved
ones or someone dear to you?!

232
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,380
What did you go through in the past?!

233
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,160
Answer me, Hordy!

234
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,830
What did humans do to you?!

235
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,290
Brother Fukaboshi-sama!

236
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,590
That bastard!

237
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,060
Yowahoshi! Brother-hoshi
is in trouble! Let's go!

238
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,360
What are you doing?! Hey! Yowahoshi!

239
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,610
Where are you going, Yowahoshi?!

240
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,460
You have to trust me no matter what
happens and stay close to the Noah!

241
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,320
No matter what happens! Understood?

242
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,900
Yowahoshi...

243
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,350
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

244
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,700
Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

245
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,950
Straw Hat Luffy-san, this is the
Air Tank. We met you a while ago.

246
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,550
Oh, it's you guys.

247
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,140
AIR TANK

248
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,140
We've been listening to what's
been going on out there.

249
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,700
And we see the Noah falling
towards the island.

250
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,650
CONTROL ROOM

251
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,520
We're getting ready as planned.

252
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,230
That's what Brother-hoshi was talking about.

253
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,780
You wanna go to the deck?

254
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,150
Hordy!

255
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,580
--Go after him!
--No, wait, Straw Hat!

256
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,870
Why?!

257
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,730
I'm sure you know it by now.

258
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,450
Hordy has an advantage in the
water since he is a Fish-Man.

259
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,490
--If nothing is done...
--What should we do?

260
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,090
I have an idea!

261
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,050
Hey, where are you going?! Brother-hoshi!

262
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:48,350
THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE FISH-MAN ISLAND

263
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,790
Prince Fukaboshi?

264
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,350
What brought you here, Prince?

265
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,980
Listen, we might need a
large amount of air soon.

266
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,340
Make preparations!

267
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,410
Yes, sir!

268
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,750
It's fine. There is some air on the deck.

269
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,040
Then I can beat him up there.

270
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,590
Aside from Decken,

271
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,720
do you think Hordy would leave the
bubble so you can fight there?

272
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,910
I want you to take this Baby
Transponder Snail just in case.

273
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,100
We need to be well-prepared. Let's go!

274
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,790
Luffy-sama! What should I do about the Noah?

275
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,090
Brother Fukaboshi-sama told me
to stay close to the Noah along

276
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,440
with Luffy-sama, no matter what happens!

277
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,890
So that's what Brother-hoshi...

278
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,500
H-Hey, hello?  How can we get air from you?

279
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,580
We can shoot all the air from the Air Tank.

280
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,100
What is the Air Tank?

281
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,100
It's an air conditioning facility that's
providing air to the Fish-Man Island.

282
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,750
If we make a bubble and shoot it,
maybe we can surround the Noah.

283
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,580
But the bubbles neutralize ascending forces

284
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,840
so it's not going to make the Noah float.

285
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,490
That means we can't stop it from falling.

286
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,790
On top of that, we have to use all the air

287
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,220
we have in order to engulf that giant ship.

288
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,070
In other words, there is only one chance.

289
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,540
If we don't shoot it at the exact moment

290
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,730
that the Noah comes right beside us,

291
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,030
there will be no second chance.

292
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,020
So basically, it's a hit-or-miss situation.

293
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,130
Y-Yes. And I'm afraid you'll
have to take it from there!

294
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,490
Again, I can't emphasize enough that...

295
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,400
Enough with the difficult
stuff and just do it!

296
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,170
I can handle anything
as long as there is air!

297
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,210
All right. We'll do our best!

298
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,300
Luffy-san, please save the island!

299
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,090
Straw Hat! Shirahoshi!

300
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,890
What can they accomplish by
swimming alongside the Noah?

301
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,680
They are only a human and a Mermaid Princess!

302
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,390
Shark Slicer!

303
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,230
Straw Hat!

304
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,270
Screw this!

305
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,730
Armament Hardening!

306
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,240
He's putting up quite a fight!

307
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,040
Hey, Human! Give it up, Human!

308
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,650
It makes me sick to my stomach
just looking at you people!

309
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,920
Even if it shortens my life and even
if it comes at the ultimate price,

310
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,760
I will execute my revenge on you humans!

311
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,180
That bastard!

312
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,370
Don't miss it! You don't
have a second chance!

313
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,650
If you miss it, the
Fish-Man Island will be...

314
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,500
Hey, Straw Hat. Can you hear me?

315
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,330
It's Brother Fukaboshi-sama!

316
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,580
Brother-hoshi, are you okay?!

317
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,470
Barely alive. Anyway, listen carefully.

318
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,900
About Hordy Jones...

319
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,690
I found out who he really is!

320
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,890
As the Noah once again draws near,

321
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,810
Fish-Man Island is in chaos
as the citizens evacuate.

322
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,050
The Straw Hats continue to
believe in Luffy and fight on.

323
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,430
Neptune's army finally
joins the battle, as well.

324
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,840
The battle at the Conchcorde
Plaza is unfolding rapidly,

325
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,390
as a new truth further
shakes up the citizens!

326
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

327
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,780
"A Shocking Fact! The
True Identity of Hordy!"

328
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
