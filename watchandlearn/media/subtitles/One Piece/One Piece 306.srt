00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,050
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,850
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,350
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,550
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,430
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,760
Stop! Stop! I said stop!

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,180
It's dangerous ahead of here!
Water is rushing towards us!

36
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,570
C-Can't you guys hear the sound of water?!

37
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,610
Listen, if the water flows into
an underground passage like this,

38
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,910
we'll have no choice but to drown.

39
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,690
Zoro-kun, can't you hear the sound of water?!

40
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,910
Hmm, it's true that
something doesn't feel right.

41
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,910
Then let's stop, you guys!

42
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,620
There's no other passage. We have
no choice but to keep on this path!

43
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,330
I knew it!

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,750
Granny and the others
are being chased by water!

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,930
Ah! Pirate guys!

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,260
Guys! Do something about this water!

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,140
Ahh! It's here!

48
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,310
Gum-Gum...

49
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,330
...Rocket!

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,360
What is it this time?!

51
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,320
Something came out!

52
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,490
That won't work! The Bone Balloon is tough!

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,290
Gum-Gum... Giant Axe!

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,320
Gum-Gum... Giant Whip!

55
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,080
Finger Pistol...! Pick!

56
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,870
Tempest Kick... Victory Bird!

57
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,160
The iron outer shell got cracked...!

58
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,470
This ship won't last long!

59
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,360
That was close. I almost got split in two.

60
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,830
Fire!

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,050
"A Mystical Mermaid Appears?
As Consciousness Fades Away..."

62
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,770
I'm shrinking!

63
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,610
That was close!

64
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,580
Why did they fire at their
own battleship? Are they idiots?!

65
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,350
But in any case, I got shrunk again.

66
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,660
Third Gear is such an interesting
idea and it's really powerful,

67
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,590
but how my body reacts is a problem.

68
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,740
Since I was pumped up for about a minute,

69
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,090
I'll probably stay shrunk for about a minute.

70
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,550
I'd better hide until I go
back to normal or I'll be killed!

71
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,930
I can't tell if he's serious or fooling around...

72
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,530
But in the end, he's still alive.

73
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,990
Well, it'd be disappointing if he died from
a small cannon attack like that anyway.

74
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,980
We can now see the main island front gate!

75
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,350
We're almost there!

76
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,770
Hurry!

77
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:07,810
Franky, the one you love so much,
has been taken away just like Tom-san was.

78
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,780
Do you wanna come along?

79
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,580
Ribbit!

80
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,000
Straw Hat was going on a rampage
on that battleship just a bit ago,

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,460
but now he's been blown to pieces!

82
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,640
Serves you guys right! Your captain has died!

83
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,560
Hey, hey... They fired at the ship
while their own men were on it.

84
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,400
This is the power of a Buster Call,
the attack I set in motion!

85
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,360
This is justice, Cutty Flam!

86
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,000
Now, hand Nico Robin over to us.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,320
In return, I could make your charges go away.

88
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,540
Why do you have to protect
that woman in the first place?

89
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,080
You're not even a pirate.

90
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,060
Are you saying you'd trust that dangerous
woman who carries Ohara blood in her veins

91
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,010
over the World Government that
protects you ordinary people every day?!

92
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,090
If you disobey us,
just like Tom, you'll end up dy...

93
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,270
M-My face can't get any more swollen!

94
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,400
Can it! I've heard enough of your crap!

95
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,040
He drew the elephant sword, Funkfreed!

96
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,280
That thing is powerful!

97
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,740
Listen, Funkfreed. To ensure they
won't be able to resist any longer,

98
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,470
we'll fatally wound Nico Robin,
whose guard is down right now.

99
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,960
Take this! Elephant Chop!

100
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,260
Bastard!

101
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,150
He stopped it...!

102
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,490
He's so pathetic in every respect.

103
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,340
Funkfreed! You're an elephant!
You shouldn't be losing to him!

104
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,880
Go crazy and cut them up!

105
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,610
Put your nose back to normal, elephant,

106
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,630
unless you want me to shoot
you right between the eyes.

107
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,270
All right. That's good. You're smart.

108
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,480
Nico Robin, will Straw Hat
and the others come here?

109
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,310
Everyone will... for sure.

110
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,410
Spandam, I thought I told you that
I'm betting everything on them.

111
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:56,990
What?

112
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,020
I never thought a day like this would come.

113
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,870
If I had had power on that day...

114
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,790
I'm changing the charges.

115
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,090
For the charge of building the pirate ship
for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates,

116
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,050
we'll take shipbuilding
engineer Tom to Enies Lobby.

117
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,570
That is all.

118
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,010
What got into that old geezer?

119
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,230
Oh, well. I don't have
business with his disciples.

120
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,100
Release those two disciples!

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,860
Tom-san can no longer be saved.

122
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,010
If it's the World Government we're
up against, there's nothing we can do!

123
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,660
Bear it. Tom-san saved you two!

124
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,570
If you make an enemy of them,

125
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,920
no matter how many lives
you have, it's not enough!

126
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,310
Enies Lobby is the judicial island
owned by the Government.

127
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,310
No criminals taken there...

128
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,800
...have ever returned!

129
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,180
Is he stupid or what?

130
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,220
What should we do?

131
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,800
Are you stupid, too?!

132
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,490
Just keep going; give him what he wants.
Don't be concerned about him!

133
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,730
Y-Yes, sir.

134
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,740
Stop, Puffing Tom!

135
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,700
Where are you taking your creator to?!

136
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,050
Ribbit, ribbit...!

137
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,780
I won't let you pass here!

138
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,640
Give Tom-san back to us!

139
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,570
I wanted to get Tom-san back at any cost.

140
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,120
Those who know the myth of
the impregnable Enies Lobby...

141
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,070
Those who know the power
of the World Government...

142
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,170
The Straw Hats overturn their
common sense and advance.

143
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,180
In order to rescue one friend,

144
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,840
they make the world into their
enemy without a second thought.

145
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,890
It's exhilarating.

146
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,730
Up to this very day, I've never once
forgotten about Tom-san's death.

147
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,900
The stupid face of that official...

148
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,860
Every time it went through my mind...

149
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,610
...I hoped...

150
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,140
I hoped that...

151
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,030
Hey, stop it, you idiot! Stop it! Hey!

152
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,790
...one day I'd be able to crush him...!

153
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,060
...like this.

154
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,560
Thanks to them, my wish came true.

155
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,320
Weapons Left!

156
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,020
I'm someone who once died in the past.

157
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,680
If it enables the Straw Hats
to leave this place alive,

158
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,790
I don't mind sacrificing my life!

159
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,750
Hand over the escort ship to us!

160
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,880
I'll prepare an escape route for them!

161
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,730
I'll fight, too. I'm okay now.

162
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,230
Run with all your might!

163
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,230
You'll die if you stay on the island!
Sail out on my raft!

164
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,450
What about you, Saul?

165
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,270
This is it for me. I got caught.

166
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,710
Go!

167
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,860
No! There's no one on the sea!

168
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,810
Listen carefully, Robin!

169
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,640
You're alone now, but you'll
meet friends someday for sure!

170
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,310
Friends?

171
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,600
Right. The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...

172
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,530
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!

173
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:53,750
No one is born into this world to be alone!

174
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,660
Run, Robin! Don't look back!

175
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,090
Live together with them.

176
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,870
This is different from Ohara... From that time.

177
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,060
There's nothing to be afraid of...

178
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,020
...because... I'm not... alone anymore!

179
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,290
Hurry!

180
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,930
The entrance to Enies Lobby...
The main gate is around the corner!

181
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,490
We're almost there!

182
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,890
Go! Giants!

183
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,200
Leave it to us!

184
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,170
We'll be able to get off the island!

185
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,360
We'll be able to escape!

186
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,110
All right!

187
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,690
There, we did it!

188
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,660
So how about it--were you
impressed by our giant guts?!

189
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:21,910
What?!

190
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,670
Oh, no...

191
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,810
Three battleships!

192
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,630
They arrived here ahead of us!

193
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,730
Look! They really came!

194
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,350
I'm sure we tied them up in the courthouse!

195
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,050
How did they do it?

196
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,180
Vice Admiral!

197
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,210
Yeah...

198
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,060
--Aim at them.
--Yes, sir!

199
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,980
After stating your unit and marine code

200
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,600
and showing your picture ID,
you may board the battleship!

201
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,140
Okay. Go.

202
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,070
What a relief. I thought we were gonna
get eliminated along with the island.

203
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,130
Resisting is futile, pirates.

204
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,260
Make one move, and we'll fire
our guns and cannons at you.

205
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,630
This is bad!

206
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,630
It sure doesn't seem like
they're gonna let us get away.

207
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,250
Behind us is a harbor and an island on fire.

208
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,850
There's no place to escape, either.

209
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,810
In front of us are guns and cannons...

210
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,900
What're you thinking about right now, Paulie?

211
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,690
Memories of my past.

212
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,110
Don't say something like that.

213
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,360
Or...

214
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,410
Or...?

215
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,370
The hell that we're headed to now...

216
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,120
Ribbit!

217
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,920
We finished retrieving marines and officials.

218
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,340
To all battleships.
Maintain a distance from the main gate.

219
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,300
What're they trying to do?!

220
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,190
Th-This is...

221
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,820
H-He found me!

222
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,820
That's quite an unbalanced
combat power you've got.

223
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,720
You should willingly accept it,

224
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,230
if that's the price you pay
for the power you used earlier.

225
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,370
Life Return. Paper Art. Fighting Form.

226
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,840
Finger Pistol!

227
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,420
After all, your ridiculous attacks wouldn't...

228
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,340
I-I got stuck!

229
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,060
This is bad!

230
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,910
Sorry, but die in that stupid state, Straw Hat!

231
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,690
Finger Pistol! Spots!

232
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,250
Go back to normal, body!
Hurry! Hurry! I'm gonna be killed!

233
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,130
The damage I took earlier is affecting my legs!

234
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,130
Oh? I'm going back...!
I'm going back to normal!

235
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,690
See? My attacks...

236
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,770
...did a number on you after all.

237
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,210
Is there anything we can do?

238
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,610
We have to do something...! Or we'll all drown!

239
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,640
When we still haven't really
gotten Robin-chan back yet...!

240
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,750
Is this it? My life...

241
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,100
...was quite fun... Hey!
I haven't lived long enough!

242
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,940
Besides, it wouldn't even be funny

243
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,860
if the great Usopp, brave warrior
of the sea, died from drowning!

244
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,200
I can't hold my breath any longer!

245
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,760
I can't breathe...! Everything's going dark!

246
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,540
Help!

247
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,500
You'll be fine. Get ahold of yourselves!
I'm not gonna let you die!

248
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,420
What?! What's going on?!

249
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,050
My body is being pulled by something!

250
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,970
Oh... Am I dreaming?

251
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,940
I must be...!

252
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,000
Several sailors are drowning in the sea...

253
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,910
As their consciousness fades away,
they see an elegant tail fin...

254
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,880
When they look up, they see
long hair swaying in the sea...

255
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,940
She's so beautiful.

256
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,450
This is the mermaid legend...
It's like we're seeing a fantasy...

257
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,940
If I'm dreaming... please don't let me...

258
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,640
...wake...

259
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,180
I'm gonna go super express!
Make sure you hold your breath tight!

260
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,480
Du...

261
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,530
--Du...
--Du...

262
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,490
Du... A dugong?!

263
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,930
What on earth... is this Buster Call thing?!

264
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,350
Hey! Hurry up, Straw Hat!

265
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,850
Your friends... Your friends...
are waiting for you here!

266
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

267
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,650
"Cannon Fire Sinks the Island!
Franky's Lamentation"

268
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
