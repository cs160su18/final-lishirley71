2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,310
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,550
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,340
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,600
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,230
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,670
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,990
It's not an exit... It's an entrance!!

20
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,030
It's a sky island!

21
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,230
Heso!

22
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,590
I'm sorry, I'm coming to a stop!

23
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,920
Is everyone all right?

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,510
You're the one who crashed!

25
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,890
It sure does require you to get the hang of it!

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Nami-san!! You're the coolest!!

27
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,530
Whoa! This is incredible! I can't believe it!

28
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,860
Why is she able to ride that thing?!

29
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,080
Hey, where did Nami-san go?

30
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,960
Father, I wonder if she's all right.

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,700
Yes, Conis-san, I'm a bit concerned myself.

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,420
Why? What's the matter?

33
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,370
Here in Skypiea, there's a place that we're
never to step foot in no matter what.

34
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,920
Never to step foot in?

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,640
Why's that?

36
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,460
--It's sacred ground.
--Sacred ground?

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,110
We call that place...

38
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,070
...Upper Yard, the land where God lives.

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,860
"The Forbidden Sacred Ground! The Island
Where God Lives and Heaven's Judgment!"

40
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,020
There's a God?!

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,020
In a place where we're never to set foot in?!

42
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,650
--Yes.
--God... you mean that God?

43
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,680
God lives on the sky island?!

44
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,370
Yes. Since Skypiea is God's Land,

45
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,260
it's ruled by the Almighty God Eneru.

46
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,820
The Almighty God?

47
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,240
God Eneru knows everything in this world.

48
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,440
Everything?!

49
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,280
He's also watching us all the time.

50
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,760
--All the time?!
--Now, too?

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
Of course.

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,830
What?! He's watching us now?!

53
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,310
Humph. God, huh?

54
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,170
You don't believe in God?

55
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,520
I don't know. Whether or not
God exists doesn't matter to me.

56
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,140
I couldn't care less from the beginning.

57
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,840
But I don't intend to deny
those who want to believe.

58
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,810
So, have you seen that God who
lives in Upper Yard, Conis-chan?

59
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,420
No! God forbid!

60
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,030
We cannot step foot in Upper Yard. Never...

61
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,720
The sacred ground, Upper Yard, is forbidden.

62
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,090
So, the sky island has ground, too...

63
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,050
I see. A place that we're not
allowed to go no matter what, huh?

64
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,680
Ah! Your eyes...!

65
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,400
What're you thinking about right now?!

66
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,310
Listen good! "Never step foot in" means

67
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,520
you're absolutely not
supposed to go there, Luffy!

68
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,490
Oh, I see... So there's a place
that we're not supposed to go.

69
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,890
I see. A place that we're absolutely
not supposed to go, huh?

70
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
He's definitely planning to go there.

71
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Hm? But if he's God, wouldn't he forgive you

72
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,370
even if you go someplace you're
not supposed to? He's nice, right?

73
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,150
Well... But breaking God's
rules is blasphemous, so...

74
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,560
I see. Well, I guess it doesn't matter either way.

75
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,310
That's because he intends to go
even if he won't be forgiven!

76
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,780
So, what happens if someone goes
into that forbidden Upper Yard?

77
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,110
Th-That's...

78
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,070
That's...?

79
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,220
The person cannot come back alive.
Everyone believes so.

80
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
Cannot come back alive?!

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,700
I-I'm worried about Nami-san.

82
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,710
I hope she isn't near Upper Yard.

83
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,490
--Nami-san!! Stay where you are
--In any case, let's go there, to find Nami!

84
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,330
--and don't go anywhere!!
--Is your reason for going really to find Nami?!

85
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,680
--Nami-san!!
--Isn't it really so you can
go to the forbidden land?!

86
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,210
Nami-san!!

87
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,980
What's with the huge trees?

88
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,400
I've never seen something this big before.

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,450
How old are these trees?
Several hundred years?

90
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,890
All these trees...

91
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,970
I can't see the top of them!

92
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,730
There's no doubt about it!

93
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,710
The treasure should definitely be here!

94
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,620
An extraordinary treasure is here.

95
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,130
We're very close, it's almost within our grasp!

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,590
There's someone there.

97
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,740
The treasure is close by! Hurry up!

98
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,110
The voice came from over here.

99
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,230
Hey, Luffy! Let's go!

100
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,440
Hm... Hold on a second.
We'll go after I finish these.

101
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,410
What're you gonna do if
something happens to Nami-san

102
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,320
while you're sitting around like it's nothing?!

103
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Just leave them there,
since we're coming right back!

104
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,870
Hmmm... Hold on! This one, too.

105
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,280
Conis-chan, it'll be night if I wait for him!

106
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,370
Take me to that Upper Yard place!

107
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,500
What? B-But...

108
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,540
Hm?

109
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,940
...we don't know if she was really headed there.

110
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,510
And...

111
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,650
...if we incur God Eneru's wrath,
we'll really be in big trouble.

112
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,020
God Eneru seems to be pretty scary.

113
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,820
God Eneru... God, huh?

114
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,550
No one...

115
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,700
...seems to be on that boat.

116
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,120
Claw marks...! I wonder if it
was attacked by something.

117
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,510
There's no doubt about it!

118
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,350
The treasure should definitely be here!

119
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,170
An extraordinary treasure is here!

120
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,730
We're very close...

121
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,910
--Th-The seashell is talking!
--It's almost within our grasp!

122
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,420
--Th-The seashell is talking!
--The treasure is close by!

123
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,150
Hurry up!

124
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,250
This is a seashell, right? There's no
way there's a human in here, right?

125
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,850
Listen! If we keep a record like this,
it may become useful later!

126
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,460
So this seashell can record voices!

127
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,140
I-I don't want to! I'm going back.

128
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,600
I-I'm scared! I can feel it!
I can feel God's anger!

129
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,010
What's that noise?!

130
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,320
C-Can't be...!

131
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,810
It's God!

132
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,240
They were killed?

133
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,500
By God?

134
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,850
I'm going back. It's creepy.

135
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,630
It seems better to leave this area.

136
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,850
Help!

137
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,190
Help!

138
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,280
Now, we're off!!

139
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,410
To the place we're not allowed to go!!

140
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,080
Ah! I'm sorry! There's a headwind right now.

141
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,670
With this wind, going to Upper Yard
will take quite long! I'm sorry!

142
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,590
--What?!
--Quite long?

143
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,180
If this ship moved using dial energy,
it wouldn't take that long.

144
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,810
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,060
How long do you mean by "quite long"?

146
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,710
I don't know. Only the wind knows.

147
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,610
--I see... Quite long, huh?
--Old guy! Isn't there any other way

148
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,760
--I'd very much like to go,
since I'm worried about Nami.
--Old guy! Isn't there any other way

149
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,630
--I'd very much like to go,
since I'm worried about Nami.
--to get there quicker?

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,430
--Even I, Usopp-sama, the hero...
--to get there quicker?

151
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,530
--Even I, Usopp-sama, the hero...
--We'd better hurry, or Nami will be back!

152
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,080
...can't control the wind.

153
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,120
Hey, Luffy! So that was why, after all!!

154
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,000
--"That"? Which "that"?
--You liar.

155
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,540
Tsk! That son of a bitch! He took my prey.

156
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,880
What's going on? I can hear noises.

157
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,220
What on earth...?

158
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,760
Just give up!

159
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,430
You should, too. He's mine.

160
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,930
Stay out of my way!

161
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,220
Hoho! Same to you!

162
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,730
Hoho!

163
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,860
Wh-What on earth...?

164
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,080
What's going on... in this forest?!

165
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,560
There's finally a dangerous place we can go!

166
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,680
I can't sit around and wait
till the wind changes!

167
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,770
Hey Luffy! Could that be...

168
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,940
...the old broken waver?!

169
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,570
Here I come!!

170
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,360
That idiot!

171
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,660
This was obviously going to happen!

172
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,710
Help... me...

173
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,580
What're we gonna do? He sank again.

174
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,080
Just leave him!

175
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,710
Geez, you're such a pain!

176
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,010
So, this is your old waver.

177
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,840
This is really old.

178
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,340
We found it in the sea in the world below.

179
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,650
Would you like me to take a look?
If it can be fixed, I'll fix it for you.

180
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,570
You can fix it, old guy?

181
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,570
I'm a dial ship engineer.

182
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,120
Really?! Then, please fix it! Please...

183
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,700
...do it quickly!

184
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,580
Eneru...!

185
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,980
He's my prey!

186
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,960
Oh? So you want to compete, huh?

187
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,940
I don't mind fighting with you...

188
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,180
...to kill my boredom!

189
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,760
Ha! That's a joke.

190
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,780
Do you want me to put your
body in this guy's stomach?!

191
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,080
Hohoho! Small fries crushing each other?

192
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,040
That'll be a sight! Hoho!

193
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,170
You're the small fry!

194
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,340
Wh-What?! What?!

195
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,880
Hey! Help me!

196
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,420
Let me ride with you!

197
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,850
Err... Ride with me? But this
is a one-person boat, so...

198
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,920
I came here from another sky
island in search of treasure!

199
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,520
But I don't care about it any more.

200
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,360
Please!

201
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,150
Can another person ride on this? I don't know!

202
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,500
E-Even if I had to kill you...

203
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,200
Guerrilla!!

204
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,580
G-God...

205
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,520
Son of a bitch! Is this Eneru's doing?!

206
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,320
How dare you harm Vearth?!

207
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,720
Get some Water Dials now!

208
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,780
Put out the fire!

209
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,130
"Angel Island
Lovely Street"

210
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,880
Together now, salute!

211
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,550
Heso!

212
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,510
"Captain McKinley
White Berets, Skypiea Police"

213
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,510
Heso, everyone!

214
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,470
That's the White Berets!

215
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,810
I wonder if something happened.

216
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,050
Everyone, please be careful!

217
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,810
Illegal entrants have infiltrated
Skypiea through Angel Beach today!

218
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,280
What?!

219
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,610
It was reported that there are
a total of seven infiltrators!

220
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,300
We, the White Berets,

221
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,810
are currently conducting a
full-scale search for these criminals!

222
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,020
Please watch out for suspicious individuals!

223
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,580
Please watch out!

224
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,790
It looked like that man
was talking to someone.

225
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,030
It was a guerrilla. He's just run away.

226
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,830
Hey, shut that dog up.

227
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,260
He was probably begging for his life.

228
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,200
But what is Eneru-sama thinking,
taking care of that man by himself?

229
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,650
Why were we...?

230
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,750
We probably ran out of time.

231
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,730
Ran out of time?

232
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,190
Another group of illegal entrants
has already infiltrated this land.

233
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,190
Hm? Again?

234
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,200
Old lady Amazon informed us that it's a
ship with seven Blue Sea people on board.

235
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,490
Seven Blue Sea people... Could he mean us?!

236
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,910
He said illegal entrants...

237
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,630
If you're going to the upper area,

238
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,420
pay the entrance fee of
one billion Extol per person.

239
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,130
That is the law.

240
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,090
Could it be because we
didn't pay the entrance fee?

241
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,970
No way!

242
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,550
The people who were riding that boat...

243
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,220
...and, that man, too...

244
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,570
Because they entered illegally, they were...

245
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,700
Then, will the same thing that
happened to that man happen to us?!

246
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,820
There's no challenge in taking
care of only seven people.

247
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,710
Seven heads... We can't divide them by four.

248
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,460
What just happened?

249
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,370
Who the hell are they?!

250
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,770
And what is this place?!

251
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,340
I have to tell everyone immediately!
This place is crazy!

252
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,890
Well? Usopp, look at this!

253
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,580
Mine's finished, too!

254
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,500
Check out that art!
Don't they look just like us?

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,970
That's amazing!

256
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,830
Just how does that look like us?!

257
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,710
This is what I think... of your art!

258
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,370
--While Nami-san could be in danger,
you're fooling around!!
--Stop it! How dare you?!

259
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,210
--Take this! And this!
--Stop it! How dare you?!

260
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,630
--Take this! And this!
--Don't take it out on my art!

261
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,320
--Can it be fixed?
--I've never seen these parts.

262
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,890
Please fix it one way or another.

263
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm sorry, but I can't say much
until I investigate it more.

264
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,480
Anyhow, please try.

265
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,980
I'll try disassembling it.

266
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,990
Old guy, what's that?

267
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,080
You, suspicious ship over there, hold it!

268
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,370
Who're they?

269
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,480
Why the heck are they crawling?

270
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,490
I don't know.

271
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,070
They're probably... weirdos!

272
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,190
What?! So those are weirdos...

273
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,250
Everyone, halt!

274
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
--Heso!
--Heso!

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
Why, heso!

276
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,200
H-Hey, what're you guys saying?

277
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,560
Who're they?

278
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,040
Usopp said they're weirdos.

279
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:01,160
So you're the seven illegal entrants
who came from the Blue Sea?!

280
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,840
What?

281
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,550
I'll humbly bring Heaven's Judgment upon you!

282
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:17,520
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

283
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:27,890
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

284
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:43,460
There are days where I almost lose to myself

285
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:51,420
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

286
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:58,000
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

287
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,560
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

288
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:17,210
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

289
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,640
This unique moment...

290
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,820
Good! That's still only a 5th degree crime!

291
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,130
That's not good! When it's determined
to be a 5th degree crime,

292
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,800
in the name of God Eneru,
you'll be banished to the clouds.

293
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,680
Banished to the clouds?

294
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,390
What's that? Being banished to
the clouds sounds kinda nice.

295
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,520
No, it doesn't! It's the death penalty!

296
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,980
Death penalty?!

297
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,950
"Already Criminals?!
Skypiea's Upholders of the Law"

299
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,140
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
