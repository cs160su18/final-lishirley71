00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

22

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,230

One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,480
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,940
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,610
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,410
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,330
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,170
Uh, everybody on the Fish-Man Island.

81
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,590
Can you hear me?

82
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:04,050
I'm the captain of the New Fish-Man
Pirates from the Fish-Man District,

83
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,600
Hordy Jones!

84
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:18,360
"The Kingdom in Shock!
An Order to Execute Neptune Issued!"

85
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,780
All right. Next!

86
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,570
Next!

87
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,160
Next!

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,750
You won't step on it?!

89
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm sure Queen Otohime would forgive us.

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,720
If I refuse, they'll kill
me! I have no choice!

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,350
I'm sorry, Queen Otohime!

92
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,890
Okay, you pass! Next!

93
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,150
This is boring! Surprisingly,
they're all just stepping on it.

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,360
Otohime was not that
well-respected after all!

95
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,950
Daruma-san, Captain Hordy is on the air now!

96
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,070
Huh?

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,710
--So he is the one who is behind all of this!
--He made us step on the picture!

98
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,550
Hey, wasn't he the one who killed
the assassin of Otohime-sama?

99
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,050
Yes, his name is Hordy Jones!
I'm sure it was him!

100
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,680
Wasn't he a soldier of Neptune's army?

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,060
There is something I want
to tell all citizens of...

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,730
SEA FOREST

103
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,060
...the Ryugu Kingdom.

104
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,400
This country will soon be destroyed.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,940
And it will be rebuilt under a new king.

106
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,150
Namely, me!

107
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,170
What is he talking about?!

108
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,170
CORAL HILL

109
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,420
Who does he think he is?! Cut the crap!

110
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,260
--Where is he broadcasting from?
--What happened to the King?

111
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,720
I heard the Straw Hats occupied
the palace - what happened to them?

112
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,260
What's going on in this country?

113
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,020
The new Fish-Man Island over which I will
rule is going to be strict in discipline.

114
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,400
Those of you who hope for
friendly relations with humans,

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,110
get packing and leave this country!

116
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,360
Humans are weak and they
don't know their place.

117
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,870
They don't deserve any help
from us strong Fish-Men.

118
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,620
Instead, we will have new residents
from the Fish-Man District soon.

119
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,090
They hate humans and hope to
change this island like us.

120
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,380
They're in the same camp as us.

121
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,470
What? New residents?

122
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,550
WATERWHEEL TOWN

123
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,430
All those outlaws will come and live with us?

124
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,560
I bet you all witnessed how your
beloved Queen Otohime died.

125
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,860
She was so selfless and tried so hard to
build a bridge between Fish-Men and humans.

126
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,490
But who killed her?!

127
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,990
It was a human.

128
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:20,040
If you trust them and meet halfway
in friendship, they'll disappoint you again!

129
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,790
Why can't you see it?!

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,550
That bastard!

131
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,590
Duped by the Neptune family, you are
all heading down the path of death.

132
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,810
Their high-sounding
dream is just unfeasible.

133
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,730
It's a lie that will lead you to perdition.

134
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,770
No!

135
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,940
Look at this!

136
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,570
Father-sama!

137
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,860
Father-sama!

138
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,320
Father!

139
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,950
King-sama!

140
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,200
The Great Knight Neptune
got old like anyone else.

141
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,460
There is no future for the Fish-Man
Island if the old guard remains in power.

142
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,800
Unfortunately the King
was captured because of us...

143
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,970
...or Zoro.

144
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,100
Don't worry, Nami-san.
It's all that Moss Head's fault.

145
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,430
What did you people do?!

146
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,690
B-B-But, Boss Jimbei!

147
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,320
Soldiers of Neptune's army attacked
Nami-chin and the others first!

148
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,030
Neptune's army?

149
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,950
Citizens of Fish-Man Island!

150
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,320
It's time to say goodbye...

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,330
...to the old Ryugu Kingdom!

152
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,290
Three hours from now, at Conchcorde Plaza,

153
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,460
I'm going to cut this
incompetent King's head off!

154
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,420
The Great Pirate Era began...

155
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,970
...when they executed a human -
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates.

156
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,270
That era saw humans grow
to persecute Fish-Men.

157
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:12,860
So this time, by executing Neptune,
I'll start the Great Fish-Man Era...

158
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,030
...where Fish-Men will dominate humans.

159
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:22,830
As you may know by now, I'm at the Ryugu Palace
as I speak. And we found something good.

160
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,880
It's the letter from the Celestial Dragons
that Queen Otohime got 10 years ago,

161
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,380
at the risk of her life!

162
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,180
If I destroy that letter, it's over.
You won't get another one.

163
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,600
And,

164
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
in this big box,

165
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,610
there are signatures from
the majority of this country.

166
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,280
I couldn't believe my eyes!

167
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,160
There are so many fools who
want to befriend humans!

168
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:10,830
Those of you who have signed your
name would oppose my new kingdom.

169
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,290
So this is actually...

170
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,090
...a list of traitors!

171
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,670
No more stepping on her picture.

172
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,430
It would be easy to pretend
you don't mind stepping on it.

173
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,690
But these signatures will tell
who is my enemy and who is not.

174
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,110
It's hard evidence!

175
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,660
I will take care of those enemies one by one.

176
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,070
First...

177
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,120
Togare from Coral Hill.

178
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,210
No, I... I'm not... I...

179
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,340
Next, Gotan from Waterwheel Town.

180
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,210
What?

181
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,010
Luca from Mermaid Cove.

182
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,640
Garcia from Fishverly Hills.

183
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,940
Meverly from the Coral Apartment.

184
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,560
There are a lot more!

185
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,480
Stop!

186
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,440
I won't let you hurt my folk!

187
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,700
Well, enough for now.
We don't have time anyway.

188
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
Lastly...

189
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,420
Straw Hat Pirates!

190
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,550
I'll show you something good.

191
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,390
I know you are somewhere on
the island watching this.

192
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,730
You people shattered Arlong's dream
- he was a symbol of Fish-Men's anger.

193
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,140
Zoro! Usopp! Brook!

194
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,270
--What fools...
--I can't believe they got caught!

195
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,480
Do it.

196
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,440
Yes, Boss!

197
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,280
Do it.

198
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,830
--Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh?
--Wh-What's going on?!

199
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,550
Th-This is so high!

200
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,510
--What's this noise?
--It's like a roar...

201
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,770
--It's water!
--It's water!

202
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,070
That room will be filled with water by
the time we finish executing the King.

203
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,910
You lowly creatures can't
survive that, can you?

204
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,200
Straw Hat Luffy with a 400
million berry bounty!

205
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,170
Your people's heads will serve perfectly
as a lesson to humans above ground.

206
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,130
Now, let's start cleaning
up the old Ryugu Kingdom!

207
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,480
Bury the embarrassing past and shift
the helm towards the great future!

208
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,060
The Fish-Man Island will win
back its pride in three hours!

209
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,410
I-I can't believe it!

210
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,970
We won't let them do that!

211
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,620
Now, issue an order to Daruma
and the others to assemble.

212
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,080
It's gonna get busy.

213
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,880
Yes, Boss.

214
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,790
I'll make your execution a big show.

215
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,930
So that all citizens of the
Fish-Man Island will be afraid of me.

216
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,390
How could you be so selfish?
You can't govern a country like that!

217
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,480
All kings are selfish.

218
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,110
You were a selfish king to us.

219
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:51,320
You and Otohime's dream made me sick
ever since I was a soldier in your army.

220
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,870
When the leader changes,
a country will change, too.

221
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,330
I will be the "law" from now on!

222
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,340
Damn! The water level keeps rising!

223
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,470
Usopp-san, I just got dry.
I don't wanna soak in sea water again!

224
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,390
Me neither!

225
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,680
Do something, Zoro-kun!

226
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,140
All right. Then...

227
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,850
...untie me.

228
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,400
Got it!

229
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,650
I feel it! I feel my psychic power!
Chains, come off! Chains, come off!

230
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,620
Chains, come off! Come
off, chains! Come off...

231
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,660
...or not!

232
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,250
It's no good. I don't have any psychic power.

233
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey hey, did you see it?

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,880
The look on those Fish-Men's
faces when I moved.

235
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,010
He isn't moving. Is he dead?

236
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,600
I should stay dead.

237
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,020
What should we do with
these skeletal remains?

238
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,320
How did they even get here?

239
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,950
I guess they flowed in with the water when
Captain Hordy broke the wall of the palace.

240
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,910
Let's pull them up onto the bridge.

241
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,240
Great!

242
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,580
Brook can free us later if he
keeps pretending to be dead.

243
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,040
He was adrift at sea. I feel sorry for him.

244
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,210
He must've been dead for 50 years or so.

245
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,630
That's correct!

246
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,010
You got it right!

247
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,850
H-He's moving!

248
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,560
Yes, I'm a dead skeleton--Brook!

249
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,310
Wait!

250
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,320
Nice, Brook!

251
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,700
Touch my bones!

252
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,830
Here, here, here! Here!

253
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,330
That's enough!

254
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,470
Damn.

255
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,810
Oh, I can't stop laughing
just thinking about it!

256
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,600
We got caught because of you!

257
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,100
Help! They're gonna kill me!

258
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,360
Oh, I'm already dead.

259
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,070
Well, at least Nami and the others got away.

260
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,030
They can bring Luffy and the others here.

261
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,200
What if they don't come?!

262
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,990
Robin would say,

263
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,460
"I hope Nami hasn't been
eaten by a deep-sea fish."

264
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,540
Sounds exactly like her!

265
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,310
This is different from any of
Poneglyphs than I've seen before.

266
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,530
This is like a letter... A letter of apology.

267
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,950
Who are you apologizing to? And who are you?

268
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,530
"Joy Boy."

269
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,100
Hey.

270
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:53,730
He said I'm worth 400 million!
When did they raise it?

271
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,280
This is no time for that!

272
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,990
Obviously, they want to fight us.

273
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,450
The War of the Best at Marineford
made you infamous instantly.

274
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,250
When it goes over 300 million,
it's not easily increased again.

275
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,840
But if somebody wants
to fight me, I'll fight!

276
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,720
Hey wait, Luffy-kun!

277
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,720
Father-sama...

278
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,890
Father-sama!

279
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,310
Father-sama! Father-sama!

280
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,150
Megalo!

281
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,280
I have to go save him!

282
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,110
Wait, Princess Shirahoshi!

283
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,490
Stop, Megalo!

284
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,040
Wait!

285
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,370
Boss Jimbei-sama! But...

286
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,540
Luffy-kun, Princess-sama,
both of you have to wait!

287
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,920
Princess, I don't think you should go either.

288
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,300
Hachi-sama...

289
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,930
What Hordy is most afraid of
in the Ryugu Kingdom now is...

290
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,180
...Princess Shirahoshi's ability!

291
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,320
Even if he reshapes the Fish-Man
Island exactly the way he wants,

292
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,110
once she controls the Sea Kings
to attack the island, it'll be gone.

293
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,620
He took the King hostage
to use him as a shield.

294
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,000
So what they're really going
for is Shirahoshi-chan.

295
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,800
Hordy is not planning to capture
her and get control of her power.

296
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,550
He prefers her power didn't exist at all.

297
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,180
That's why he teamed up with Decken
who is capable of killing her.

298
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Hordy wants to get rid of everything
that could stand in his way.

299
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,650
He is right.

300
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:01,070
Rushing to the plaza is just what
Hordy wants Princess-sama to do!

301
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,570
I have been told about my power but...

302
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,410
...I have never communicated
with the Sea Kings-sama.

303
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,830
I don't even know if I really
have that kind of power...

304
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,960
But even so, I'm sure that
Hordy will try to kill you.

305
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,510
And we shouldn't let Hordy know
that you can't control the power.

306
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,340
It's good that he is afraid of it.

307
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,520
Is that all? Then I'll get going.

308
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,100
Shark! Take me to the Ryugu Palace!

309
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,770
Sanji, take care of Coward!

310
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,190
Yeah! Count on it.

311
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,480
I said "Wait," Luffy-kun!

312
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,690
Huh?

313
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,200
You people shouldn't fight Hordy!

314
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,570
Why are you trying to stop me?

315
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,370
Is it because we're humans?

316
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,580
You two shouldn't say that!
It makes things more complicated!

317
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,960
That's right! You humans shouldn't do that!

318
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,210
The surviving Fish-Men
will hate humans again!

319
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,970
You have to leave it to me.

320
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,600
Jimbei! They have my crew!

321
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,730
And I got to do something about Hordy
before my friends get into real trouble!

322
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,350
Luffy-chin...

323
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,150
Straw Hat.

324
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,190
Why can't you see it?!

325
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,990
--I'm going.
--You're impossible!

326
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,240
Just shut up!

327
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,330
Stop me if you can!

328
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,620
Luffy.

329
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,630
I shouldn't let my guard down
just because we fought together.

330
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,510
I almost forgot that
you're that man's brother.

331
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,350
If you're not going to
listen to me, I have no choice!

332
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,100
Whoa... Whoa!

333
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,950
You ready to do this?

334
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,950
Kid?

335
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,420
Luffy and Jinbei's emotional
battle has begun!

336
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,930
Luffy faces the overwhelming force
of Jimbei's Fish-Man Karate.

337
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,730
Their duel is interrupted,
and takes an unexpected turn!

338
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

339
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,230
"A Rift Opens Up!
Luffy vs. Jimbei!"

340
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
