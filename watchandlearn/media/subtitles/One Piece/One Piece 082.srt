00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,020
Whoa!

22
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,690
So this is a winter island!

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,860
The name of those mountains
is the Drum Rockies.

24
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,660
In the castle on top of the
tallest mountain lives Dr. Kureha,

25
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,660
the only doctor in our country who is
called a "witch" by our country's people.

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,800
Okay then, Nami. Hang on tight.

27
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,900
Okay...

28
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,890
Let's go!

29
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,660
Watch out for Lapins.

30
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,250
They're carnivorous, ferocious bunnies.

31
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,200
If you run into a group
of them, you're dead.

32
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,320
They have bodies like bears,
but the agility of bunnies...

33
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,770
and they attack in groups.

34
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,510
Run!

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,870
What're they doing?

36
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,180
Those damn bunnies...
This can't be happening...

37
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,210
Hey, Sanji. What's the matter?

38
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,290
What the heck is going on?

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,680
Hey... we're gonna run, Luffy!

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,660
"Dalton's Resolve!
Wapol's Corps Lands On The Island"

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,160
R-run? Where to?

42
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,780
Doesn't matter where! Someplace far!

43
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,750
What?!

44
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,070
An avalanche...! An avalanche is coming!

45
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,020
Ahhh! Those damn bunnies!
They'll never get away with this! Dammit!

46
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,610
Wh-wh-wh-what're we gonna do?!
Wh-wh-what're we gonna do, Sanji?!

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,420
How should I know?!
The first priority is Nami-san!

48
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,890
The second is Nami-san!
The third is Nami-san!

49
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,560
The fourth is Nami-san!
And the fifth is Nami-san!

50
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,970
Got that?!

51
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,060
Protect her even if it kills you!

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,640
Got it!

53
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,280
But how?!

54
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,410
Over there! That cliff!

55
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,480
Cliff?!

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,380
Run! We need to get as high up as we can!

57
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,330
It's coming!

58
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,890
Good, we made... Ahh!

59
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,370
Oh no! We're not high enough!

60
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,490
Wapol...

61
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,060
Wapol came back!

62
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,990
What?!

63
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,450
Dalton-san headed to Big Horn!

64
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,650
Those who can fight, grab a
weapon and head to Big Horn!

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,040
Hurry! Those who can fight,
head to Big Horn!

66
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,090
Follow Dalton-san!

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,930
Follow Dalton-san!

68
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,550
Wapol came back!

69
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,840
Everyone, grab a weapon!

70
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,130
We'll protect our country!

71
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,540
Grab a weapon! Head to Big Horn!

72
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,850
Yeah!

73
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,240
Hey, Vivi. Are you really sure
this is the right direction

74
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,110
to the Gyasta town where
the witch is right now?

75
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,920
Hmmm... When you put it that way,
I'm not really sure...

76
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,200
We're in trouble if you aren't sure...

77
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,650
Listen, if Luffy and Sanji
managed to get to the castle

78
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,660
and didn't find the doctor,
they'd think, "What're we doing?"

79
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,200
Unless we find the doctor soon and
ask her to go back to the castle...

80
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,370
I know that, but...

81
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,100
If you know that, then do something.
You're a princess, right?

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,440
That has nothing to do with this.
I'm not a witch. I'm a princess.

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,570
But...

84
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,850
Then you look at the map.

85
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,610
What?! Don't be ridiculous!

86
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,150
There's snow everywhere. The map is...

87
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,590
In short, you don't know...

88
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,490
Yeah! I don't know at all!

89
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,360
You don't have to be proud!

90
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,070
In any case, there should be
a sign for Gyasta on this route.

91
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,490
So don't miss it.

92
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,140
Got it. Leave it to me!
I'll watch for signs of the sign!

93
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,030
Oh, ignoring me, huh?

94
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,660
Delicious!

95
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,130
Listen up, citizens!

96
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,570
Everything in this country is my snack!

97
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,350
I'm great!

98
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,120
Why?

99
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,310
Kuromarimo, tell them!

100
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,230
That's because you're
the king, Your Highness.

101
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,270
That's right!

102
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,650
That's exactly right!
If I wanna eat a house,

103
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,860
there's nothing like one cooked
well-done to a golden-brown after all!

104
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,340
Yeah!

105
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,710
Wapol-sama.
I have some information for you.

106
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,500
What is it?

107
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,710
I received a report that
some of the Straw Hats

108
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,450
rudely headed towards Drum Castle.

109
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,670
What? Why?!

110
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,520
It seems that they took a sick woman
to have her treated by a doctor.

111
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,040
Such idiots!

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,880
No one lives in my castle now,
not to mention a doctor!

113
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,250
W-well... I heard that
the outrageous Dr. Kureha

114
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,060
even more rudely currently
lives in Drum Castle...

115
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,720
What?! That old hag's
living in my castle?!

116
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,440
Just how much does
she intend to mock me?!

117
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,610
Kick her out!

118
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,780
Along with Straw Hat, I'll eat her up!

119
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,280
Men, we're going back to the castle!

120
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,920
Yeah!

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,990
Stop right there!

122
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,010
Who's that?!

123
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,930
Ahh! I was cut down! I'm gonna die!

124
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,800
Dalton-san!

125
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,320
I came here to kill you.
You dying suits me just fine.

126
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,520
You bastard, Dalton!

127
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,180
So you're alive!

128
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,730
How dare you hurt Wapol-sama!

129
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,750
It shouldn't be a big deal...

130
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,360
with the excellent doctors of our country,

131
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,690
the "great medical care nation" Drum.

132
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,070
That's right!

133
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,700
The Twenty MDs External Injury Unit!
Come forward!

134
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,560
Starting an operation.

135
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,630
Starting an operation.

136
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,530
Starting an operation.

137
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,460
Starting an operation.

138
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,530
Starting an operation.

139
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,600
Starting an operation.

140
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,660
Starting an operation.

141
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,400
Scalpel!

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,900
Needle!

143
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,630
Tin.

144
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,910
Hammer.

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,210
Well... I really thought I'd die!

146
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,630
Just like what happened now,

147
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,530
you're the only one protected
and citizens have no choice

148
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,180
but to suffer from sickness
without seeing doctors... Wapol!

149
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,540
Wapol?

150
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,020
It's Wapol-sama, my retainer Dalton.

151
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,610
He's right! You don't
have the right to blather!

152
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,430
The three of us, you included,
were Wapol-sama's top brass.

153
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,110
We were his loyal hands, remember?

154
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,200
It's true that when you
were making people suffer,

155
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,410
all I could do was just watch

156
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,570
even though I was by your
side as one of your top brass.

157
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,260
I have to take responsibility for that.

158
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,040
Wapol...

159
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,300
Let's leave this country together.

160
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,500
We must not stay in this land any longer.

161
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,520
Dalton-san! You didn't do anything wrong!

162
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,820
That's right!

163
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,130
You're the only one in the
government who fought for the citizens!

164
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,480
Even when it almost killed you!

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,860
Humph! You should've died...

166
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,940
as the Captain of the
Drum Kingdom's Security Guard!

167
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,450
I'm surprised that you survived in
this country without any doctors.

168
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,640
Drum is acknowledged internationally
as a country with advanced medicine.

169
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,970
But who would know... that there
were actually only 20 doctors,

170
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,150
who worked in the research
facility of the King's castle,

171
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,420
and all the other doctors were exiled?

172
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,940
That's right!

173
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,880
Those who become sick
can beg for their lives.

174
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,010
If I feel like it, I might
lend them the Twenty MDs.

175
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,840
If they don't wanna die, all they
have to do is obey me, the king!

176
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,620
With that, my ruling is perfect.

177
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,310
That's the government of this country!

178
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,060
You can't call that a government!

179
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,400
Humph! You sure speak
your mind, don't you?

180
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,010
Kill him! Kill your ex-captain!

181
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,340
As I figured, you don't
get what I'm saying...

182
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,430
You're the son of the previous
king who was good to me.

183
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,530
I was hoping that you'd
come to your senses some day,

184
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,170
but it seems like that
was wishful thinking!

185
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,620
Ahh! There he goes! Ox Ox Fruit!

186
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,840
The model "Bison"!

187
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,440
Don't flinch! Fire!

188
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,870
We can't hit him!

189
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,730
He's dodging them!

190
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,010
I'll show no mercy even though
you're my ex-subordinates!

191
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,470
Fiddle Bam!

192
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,490
He's strong! How powerful!

193
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,450
So this is the wild power...
the power of a Zoan type devil fruit...!

194
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,710
I've had enough with you all.

195
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,080
A country where the king
is the first to run off

196
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,680
when the country is in crisis
should just die out!

197
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,090
You don't have a chance,
fighting against the two of us.

198
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,140
Just give up.

199
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,080
Dalton-san!

200
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,910
Dalton-san!

201
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,280
We've come to assist you!

202
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,910
Let us fight with you!

203
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,570
We'll protect this free country!

204
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,030
Above all, I've known you so long.

205
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,280
That's unfortunate for you.

206
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,280
Don't...!

207
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,450
Your weak point is...

208
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,950
Why...

209
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,180
...did you shield us...?

210
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,930
Dalton-san!

211
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,410
Dalton-san!

212
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,950
Dalton-san!

213
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,890
That's your weak point, kind Dalton-kun.

214
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,230
This is a death befitting you!

215
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,240
Wh-what's going on?!

216
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,700
Hm? What's going on? An earthquake?

217
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,360
Hey, this isn't good. We can't go
further because of the deep snow.

218
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,920
Looks like we went up the mountain...

219
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,510
Hm?

220
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,570
What's... this rumbling?

221
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,600
Usopp-san! Could this be...

222
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,560
Ahhh... A.. Avalanche...?

223
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,530
25631... 25632...

224
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,150
25633...

225
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,690
Hm? What's going on? How noisy...

226
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,980
25634...!

227
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,190
Oh no! We're not high enough!

228
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,890
What do I do now?!

229
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,240
Oh, yeah!

230
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,870
Sanji! Grab my hand!

231
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,490
You saved my skin!

232
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,160
Yeah, but...

233
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,180
even though we won't sink in the snow,

234
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,130
we'll go straight down the mountain
if we don't do anything!

235
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,920
What?!

236
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,170
Hell no! We've come all
this way and were almost

237
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,210
at the foot of that chimney mountain!

238
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,180
We were just a step away from the doctor!

239
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,350
Luffy! Come up with a way to stop this!

240
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,590
Dammit, those damn hopping bunnies!

241
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,340
Next time I see them,
I'll simmer them in a pot!

242
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,340
What?!

243
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,170
What're we gonna do, Sanji?!

244
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,490
There's only one way!

245
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,140
Run!

246
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,090
What the heck's... with them?!

247
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,220
Oh no! Luffy! Look ahead! Ahead!

248
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
Ahhh! A rock! We're gonna crash!

249
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,520
You can't crash!
You're carrying Nami-san!

250
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,800
That's easy to say, but...!

251
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,090
We're crashing!

252
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,060
You have to treat ladies... gently!

253
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,850
Sanji!

254
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,520
Sanji!

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,320
Ahhh... That hit me good...! Dammit!

256
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,320
You idiot! Don't do stuff
like that without telling me!

257
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,170
Ahhh! Sanji!

258
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,300
Ahh! It's coming!

259
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,860
It's not stopping!

260
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,440
This village will be swallowed!

261
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,640
Get out of here!

262
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,140
We're getting out of here!

263
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,410
Chess! Kuromarimo! Get on!

264
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,100
Robson!

265
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,930
Robson, Serious Mode!

266
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,040
Wapol-sama! Please let us ride, too!

267
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,290
Shut up! Get out of here on your own!

268
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,850
Robson! Hurry up! It's closing in on us!

269
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,490
W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-we'll be fine!

270
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,340
Don't worry, Vivi!

271
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,890
Even if we get swallowed,
I'll save you for sure!

272
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,300
Hey, do you think
Luffy-san and the others...

273
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,220
Could they have been
swallowed by this avalanche?

274
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,220
Ahhhh! Wapol-sama!

275
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,520
Ahh!

276
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,920
Ahh!

277
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
Ahh!

278
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,910
Ahhhhh!

279
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,080
Nami, are you cold?
Hang in there just a little longer.

280
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,090
Listen. Hold this.

281
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,600
Stay here and wait for me a little longer.

282
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
Oh, it was you guys.

283
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,010
No wonder I thought
it was an awful syrup.

284
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,710
They'll never get away with this!

285
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,050
Who are you talking about?

286
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,400
Idiot! Of course them!

287
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,440
Them meaning...?

288
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,390
You said some Straw Hats

289
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,480
are going up the mountain
to the castle right now.

290
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,160
Then this is what happened!

291
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,430
They have a huge grudge against
us over what happened between us,

292
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,880
so they caused an avalanche
on that snow mountain.

293
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,570
Oh no! That's what happened?

294
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,510
Then, this avalanche was their doing...

295
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,010
Let's go! We'll follow
them on the snow mountain!

296
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,250
I'll teach them a lesson
about battling in the snow!

297
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,040
I will definitely get you there.

298
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,780
Don't die...

299
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,500
both of you...

300
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,250
There they are!

301
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,280
Please look at that, Wapol-sama!
We found them!

302
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,790
Hold it, brat!

303
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,810
How dare you do
many rude things to me!

304
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,500
I'll beat you up!

305
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,450
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

306
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

307
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

308
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:57,560
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

309
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

310
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,310
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

311
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

312
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,880
Boy, that was close!
I'm glad I'm still alive.

313
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,720
Suddenly hitting an avalanche in this cold...
I must've run out of luck.

314
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,020
But this is a sort of
winter swimming, I guess.

315
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,660
What on earth is happening
on the mountain?

316
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,560
I wonder if Luffy-san
and the others are okay...

317
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,130
I will definitely get
you there. Nami! Sanji!

318
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,720
So hang in there a little longer.

319
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

320
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,860
"The Island Where Snow Lives!
Climb The Drum Rockies!"

321
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,270
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
