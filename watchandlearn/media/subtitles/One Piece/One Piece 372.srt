2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,220
It's show time! I'm like a lightning arrow!

48
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,640
Lightning Bone Sword...

49
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,150
Gavotte Bond en Avant!

50
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,940
Mission: Complete...

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,110
Gum-Gum...

52
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,610
H-He wouldn't...!

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,120
...Battle Axe!

54
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,620
Brook!

55
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,870
Robin-chan!

56
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,240
Gum-Gum...

57
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,760
Now we're in for it.

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,180
Shoot!

59
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,890
...Gatling!

60
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,100
Sanji! Chopper!

61
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,210
"The Incredible Battle Starts! Luffy vs. Luffy!"

62
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,440
Still standing: three!

63
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,030
Go on! Stomp all over them, Oars!

64
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,950
Gah! Here he comes!

65
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,050
It's impossible! There is no way
we can take this monster down.

66
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm fresh out of ideas!
Wh-What should we do?!

67
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,090
--Usopp!
--Huh?

68
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,340
I'll create an opening.

69
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,890
Eh?

70
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,300
So do your thing!

71
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,770
Eh? What? Zoro, what's that
supposed to mean?

72
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,270
Oh, I get it! That's what you meant!

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,980
You've got it!

74
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,310
Huh? What's going on? Usopp!

75
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,730
Gum-Gum...

76
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,430
...Pistol!

77
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,320
--Gum-Gum...
--What?!

78
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,620
108-Pound--

79
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,940
...Bell!

80
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,710
I'm out of the game if I take any direct hits.

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,230
What's taking Usopp so long?!

82
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,040
This is the battle of the century
for the great man, Usopp!

83
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,280
You'd better not move!

84
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,160
Hey, monster!

85
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,370
Yeah?

86
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,490
I'd love to play with you some more,
but the sun is rising soon.

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Why don't we finish this up?

88
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,090
Poopy!

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,340
Of all the things to say!

90
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,970
Do you seriously hope to defeat us
when you're gasping for breath?

91
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,100
Yeah!

92
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,210
What?! You're getting under my skin!

93
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,420
I don't know how to give up!

94
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,860
Now bring it on, monster!

95
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,490
Let's settle the score!

96
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,200
Of all the nerve!

97
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,090
Oars, crush the idiot already!

98
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah! Master, let me land the finishing blow!

99
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,880
You keep out of this!

100
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,470
Gum-Gum...

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,220
Zoro!

102
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,810
One Gorilla!

103
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,480
Two Gorilla!

104
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,310
Three-Sword Style...

105
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,030
...Pistol!

106
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,480
...Two Gorilla... Slash!

107
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,230
Jerk!

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
Crap!

109
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm stuck.

110
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,500
Aw, man! This bites!

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,710
Three-Sword Style...

112
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,130
...Yaksha Crow!

113
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,270
H-He did it! That worked!

114
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,100
--Usopp, now!
--Not my right arm again! Quit going after it!

115
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,900
I said that doesn't hurt me!

116
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,900
You're bouncing every which way!

117
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,410
He vanished!

118
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,290
Zoro!

119
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,660
I win.

120
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,430
Hey, Oars!

121
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,820
Look over here!

122
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,960
I did it.

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,580
What was that? I swallowed something.

124
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,540
No... You didn't!

125
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,880
Usopp, what was that...?

126
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,340
I did it... I did it!

127
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,220
I got Oars to eat salt!

128
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,560
Woot! Yay! Yay!

129
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,400
Salt? What's so great about salt?

130
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,060
Oh, yeah! You don't know.

131
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,410
Zombies are weak against salt.

132
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,870
Look! Oars is finished!

133
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,010
Luffy's shadow is gonna come out!

134
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,340
It's purification time, you zombie monster!

135
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,670
We've won!

136
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,810
Go!

137
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,330
That was a close one!

138
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,750
What is Moria's shadow doing there...?

139
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,050
I was internally guarding against that!

140
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,680
What a blissful dolt!

141
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,180
You were living in a fool's paradise if you
thought I was going to knowingly leave

142
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,520
his weakness wide open, stupid!

143
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,190
Damn it!

144
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,440
You dropped this, Long Nose!

145
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,720
Usopp!

146
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,080
Usopp!

147
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,620
Oh, no! He spilt the salt!

148
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,950
Brook got this salt for us!

149
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,780
Crap! Shoot! This is our last reserve!

150
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,630
Dang it! Shoot! Shoot!
How dare he make fun of us?!

151
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,470
Damn it! Curse him! Screw that--

152
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,470
Gum-Gum...

153
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,480
...Stamp!

154
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,010
Crush him!

155
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,900
Usopp!

156
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,530
Usopp!

157
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,580
Stop! Stop it!

158
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,700
Usopp! Usopp!!

159
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,410
Stop it!!

160
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,880
Keep it up! Turn him into dust!

161
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,880
Same goes for that woman.

162
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,060
Crush her! Smash her!

163
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,980
Trample everyone here!

164
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,690
That includes the people who are out cold!

165
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,860
They still have a little bit
of breath in their bodies.

166
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,490
Squash them till they
aren't recognizably human!

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,200
Hey, giant!

168
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,670
What do you think you're crushing?

169
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,730
There isn't a single soul under your feet.

170
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,760
Huh? I...

171
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm alive?

172
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,030
I have no idea who you are, but thank
you for saving me from--what?!

173
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,050
No way!

174
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,660
Who're you?

175
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,410
My name is...

176
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,080
...Monkey D. Luffy!

177
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,010
--L-L...
--L...

178
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,890
Luffy?!

179
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,250
Luffy?! How do you figure?!

180
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,790
I guess I can see the resemblance,
but are you sure?

181
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,370
Is it really you?

182
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,050
It's really me.

183
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,090
But even the way you talk is different...

184
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,550
What happened to you?

185
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,740
Does he have the power to transform?

186
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,600
Or did he catch on...?

187
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,810
Did he defeat everyone?

188
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,270
Uh, y-yeah...

189
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,660
Aside from us, that monster took everyone out.

190
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,940
I see. Get back.

191
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,410
"Get back"?! Luffy, do you
realize what that is?!

192
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,280
That's the zombie with your shadow!

193
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,660
To top it off, it can stretch out
and use your attacks!

194
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,120
How are you going to fight it...?

195
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,310
What are they talking about?

196
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,760
Don't worry about it! Just crush them, Oars!

197
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,550
Of course! Gum-Gum...

198
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,780
--Here it comes!
--...Rifle!

199
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,490
What?!

200
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,540
I am the one and only Luffy!

201
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,210
Hey, something is flying straight for us!

202
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,760
--What is it?!
--Is it a bird?

203
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,470
No way!

204
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,310
It's Oars!

205
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,860
Dude!

206
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,280
Is that really Luffy? I can't believe my eyes!

207
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,920
D-Damn it!

208
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,740
What?!

209
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,960
What's going on?

210
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,710
He's doing it! He's actually fighting!

211
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,690
He's kicking Oars' butt!

212
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,110
Now's our chance! Find them!

213
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,410
Huh? Who are all those people?

214
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
Any luck? Have you found them?

215
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,120
Nope! You?

216
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,290
Oh, hey!

217
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,250
--Zoro!
--I found one! He's a member
of the Star of Hope's crew!

218
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,650
Here's another!

219
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,340
He's severely injured.

220
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,050
Everyone's hurt bad!

221
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,470
One of them has even turned into a skeleton!

222
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,770
It isn't safe to leave them unconscious here.

223
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,480
Hurry and get them somewhere safe!

224
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,440
What are they doing?
And in such large numbers?

225
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,150
Think they're zombies?

226
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,290
What if they're after Zoro and the others?

227
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,110
Let's hurry down!

228
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,780
Okay!

229
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,200
Gum-Gum Stamp!

230
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,830
Oh, dang! What's going on?!

231
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,540
Oars is getting his butt kicked!

232
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,710
I can't believe someone is flinging
him around when he's so big.

233
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,180
What's going on?!

234
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,300
Hey, Oars!

235
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:08,250
Hey, did you hear? Moria-sama is
currently inside of Oars' stomach!

236
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,150
What?!

237
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,780
That means the ruler over all
of the Thriller Bark zombies

238
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,530
is getting defeated along with
the ultimate Special Zombie?!

239
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,700
What type of sick joke is this?!

240
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,910
Oars is a legendary villain that was
called the "Devil" 500 years ago!

241
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,630
We're ruled by one of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea, Gecko Moria-sama!

242
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,810
Say what?!

243
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,140
Nightmare Luffy?

244
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,430
So, bluntly put, you did that to Luffy

245
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,730
by stuffing the shadows of
a hundred people into him?

246
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,610
Exactly, members of the Star of Hope's crew!

247
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,280
Honestly, the strength
of his power terrified us!

248
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
But he'll only retain that power
for two or three minutes.

249
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,950
Before long, the shadows that we
crammed into him will fly back out.

250
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,790
We feel bad about what we did to your captain,

251
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,960
but we want to walk under the sun once more!

252
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,750
We want to be human again!

253
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,050
He is our hope!

254
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,340
The sun will be rising soon.

255
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,610
These few minutes will determine

256
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,140
the fate of everyone who has fallen victim to this island!

257
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,100
We're counting on you, Nightmare Luffy!

258
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,410
He destroyed the mansion!

259
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,830
Hurry away from the mansion!

260
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,260
He really is amazing!

261
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,890
Sweet! Keep it up, Nightmare Luffy!

262
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,450
Jerk-face! You're just a shrimp!

263
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,250
Gum-Gum Bullet!

264
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,050
Ow, ow, ow...

265
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,350
Oars, this is pathetic!

266
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,430
How did Straw Hat come by all of this power?

267
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,980
Damn! If I stay in here,
I'll keep taking collateral damage.

268
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,560
I should leave the cockpit for...

269
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,480
Gum-Gum...

270
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,190
...Pistol!

271
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,020
Gum-Gum...

272
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,640
...Battle Axe!

273
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,060
Gum-Gum...

274
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,180
...Storm!

275
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,450
Oars...!

276
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,660
Moria-sama!

277
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,130
Watch out! He's collapsing!

278
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,940
I don't believe it...

279
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,790
Oh, yeah! Where's Luffy?

280
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,130
The shadows... are leaving his body.

281
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,670
Hey, is Luffy gonna be okay?

282
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Luffy!

283
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,580
Dude, are you okay?

284
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,740
This isn't a dream, is it?

285
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,350
He won, didn't he?

286
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,070
He did! The Star of Hope won!

287
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,280
He defeated Oars and Moria!

288
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,810
Everyone will get their shadows back!

289
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:16,950
Thriller Bark has fallen!

290
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,050
Three-Sword Style Secret Technique!

291
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,670
Three Thousand Worlds!

292
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,680
Armée de l'Air Power Shoot!

293
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,260
We're up against your shadow.

294
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,310
Settle the score yourself, Luffy!

295
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,560
Yeah! Here I go!

296
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,230
Third Gear!

297
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,070
"The End of the Battle Is Nigh!
Pound in the Finishing Move!"

299
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
