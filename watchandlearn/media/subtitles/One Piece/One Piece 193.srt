00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome treasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King of
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone dreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen through
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny is
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve your
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,600
In order to prevent Luffy
and Nami from reaching the ark,

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,280
Eneru released Mamaragan. However...

19
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,140
It's useless, Eneru.

20
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,280
The land won't be beaten!

21
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,240
Luffy was approaching the ark.

22
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,260
Hand over... the golden bell!!

23
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,620
"God"

24
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,380
Disappear with the land!

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,340
Raigo!

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,970
Gum-Gum...

27
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,810
...Fi... re... works!!

28
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,720
Gold Peony!!

29
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,430
Clear up!!

30
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,020
Straw Hat! Ring the "fire of Shandora"!!

31
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:09,070
Luffy finally reached the ark, and at the
end of the fierce fight with Eneru...

32
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,530
Well then, I'll ring you as well!!

33
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,070
"God"

34
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,080
Gum-Gum...

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,170
...Gold Rifle!!

36
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,750
Reach!!

37
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,500
"The Battle Ends! Proud Fantasia Echoes Far"

38
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,760
Can you hear it?!Old diamond-head! Monkeys!!

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:35,740
The city of gold... was right here!!

40
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,800
That bonehead did it!!

41
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,550
How beautiful...

42
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,230
What a pretty sound! What is this?! What?!

43
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,150
I believed that this
moment would come one day.

44
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,390
So this was the ring that Noland heard.

45
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:17,270
Suu... I wonder if Vearth is singing...

46
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,960
So God really... exists?

47
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,670
What a miracle!

48
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:37,590
I had half given up on the bell
ringing again after its 400-year silence.

49
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,600
Great Warrior Calgara... Can you hear...

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,900
...the echo of the fire of Shandora...?

51
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,620
What happened to this land?

52
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,920
What is this tone? Could it be...?

53
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,460
Is this the legendary...?

54
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,190
Are you hearing this... Montblanc Noland?

55
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,080
Sorry to have kept you waiting so long.

56
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,440
I hope...

57
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,720
...this reaches your descendants!

58
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,690
You like this bell's sound, too?

59
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,700
Old-timer! Th-This is...

60
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,280
Yeah! There's no doubt about it.

61
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,150
There's only one bell in this
world that echoes this far!

62
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,900
This is romanticism.

63
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,750
From the sky...

64
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm getting worked up.

65
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,050
About the monsters that appear with
the cumuloregalis clouds,

66
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,580
there used to be a story like this.

67
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,210
When there is a human far up in the
sky and strong sunlight shines on him,

68
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,290
his figure is reflected in the
deep mist of the far sky.

69
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,700
The shadow looks as if it's a huge monster.

70
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,480
So the true form of those monsters are the
shadows of the humans in the sky?!

71
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,860
Then does that mean that we've
already confirmed that people live in the sky?

72
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,040
Yeah.

73
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,170
I thought the story was a meaningless fantasy
and I'd forgotten about it,

74
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,340
but it seems that it was true.

75
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,980
I can hear the loud ring of the golden bell.

76
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,160
The city of gold really exists in the sky!

77
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:20,880
"Noland The Liar"

78
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,480
Noland wasn't... My ancestor wasn't a liar!

79
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,190
You rang it to tell me that from the sky...

80
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,740
...right, kid? I appreciate it!

81
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,230
"Monkey"

82
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,000
Old-timer?!

83
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,270
What's the matter?! Are you sick?!

84
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,630
Those kids... I'm glad they were safe!

85
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,970
I was... so worried...

86
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,740
Look!! That's...

87
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,580
God's ship...

88
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,000
It's God!!

89
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,560
They're sinking...

90
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,110
God Eneru and his ship are...

91
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,550
...sinking...

92
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,070
The bell's ring is the fire of Shandora,

93
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,310
a long-gone city that took
pride in its prosperity.

94
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,530
The island's singing voice that proclaims
the end of the battle...

95
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,310
The promised ring was delivered
after 400 years...

96
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,100
Although the journey of the
restless island was long,

97
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,900
it's hard to forget the distant memory.

98
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,940
Long ago, people entrusted their words
in the sound of the bell.

99
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,660
They placed proud words in the
song sent to the distant sea.

100
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,900
Comrades...!

101
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,220
It rang...

102
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,550
Yeah.

103
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,680
I wonder... if the old
guy and the others heard it.

104
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah, I'm sure.

105
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,470
We're... right here!!

106
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,370
Tie the ropes to strong-looking trees!

107
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,510
Aisa... Were you worried?

108
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,710
Here... your treasure!

109
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,960
I don't care about that!

110
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,480
Laki...

111
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,230
How's everyone else?

112
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,400
They're fine! Don't speak right now...

113
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,460
Someone's there!

114
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,300
Am I still alive?

115
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,390
No! You have to get treated right away!

116
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,590
My treatment can wait.

117
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:11,230
Before treating me, do something about
that guy, or he'll die.

118
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,950
You're right! His body's falling apart,right
down to the bones. This is terrible!

119
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,540
Hey, that's one of the guerrillas.We
don't owe him anything.

120
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,340
Yeah. I don't really know why, but
it seemed like he was going all out, so...

121
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,330
Huh? What the heck?Are you
feeling sorry for him?

122
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Who knows...?

123
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,700
Um...

124
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,260
Is he gonna be okay, Raccoon-Doggy?

125
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,020
I'm a reindeer! Look, I have antlers!

126
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,680
Don't worry. He'll survive.

127
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,940
Thank you!

128
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,360
Pierre, go and rest with
those Blue Sea people.

129
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,050
Pierre, hurry up and go bring the families!

130
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,660
So, in the end, both the golden bell
and Eneru's golden ship...

131
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,580
I think they fell.

132
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,510
So now it's a city of gold in name only, huh?

133
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,470
Which means our journey in poverty continues.

134
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,010
I'd want those dials rather than gold,

135
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,270
since we won't be able to get them once
we get back to the Blue Sea.

136
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,740
In any case, I wonder
if Nami-san's all right.

137
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,130
I wonder where Conis-chan is...

138
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,410
Is it okay to leave Wyper with
the Blue Sea people?

139
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,780
Don't worry. It seems that Aisa
made friends with them.

140
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,710
At any rate, we have to hurry.It's
pointless if our enemy wakes up.

141
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,910
Gather those who can move.We'll
banish the priests to the clouds.

142
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,170
Yeah!

143
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,160
Are you done with him?

144
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,170
Yeah. All he needs now is rest.

145
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:18,220
Yoo-hoo!!

146
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,850
Luffy!

147
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,540
Nami-san!! Conis-chan!!

148
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,740
Luffy!!

149
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,480
Everyone! I'm glad you are okay!!

150
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,410
I was so worried, but I couldn't do anything.

151
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,320
Conis-chan, so you were worried
about me that much!

152
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,310
I don't think so.

153
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,670
Is that food, you guys? Where'd you get it?

154
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,170
We found the priests' food storage on
our way back through the forest.

155
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,000
There were more.

156
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,610
But how did you get down from that height?

157
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,250
We used my Gum-Gum Balloon.

158
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,190
By the way, Conis, where's your old man?

159
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,720
Hm?

160
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,680
Well... um... he protected me...

161
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,630
...and then Eneru...

162
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,460
Don't tell me...

163
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,900
Conis-chan...

164
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,820
Conis-san...

165
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,780
Conis...

166
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,240
Hey, we're talking about you!!

167
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,010
I'm sorry I'm still alive!

168
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,890
Father!!

169
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,690
In the White Sea on the lower level?

170
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,090
Yes. I found myself thereafter
being knocked off.

171
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,790
Those who came down to the lower level
heading towards Cloud End

172
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,520
are also coming back to the White-White
Sea via restored Milky Roads right now.

173
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,560
However, since there's no
Angel Island anymore,

174
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,290
they're heading towards Upper Yard.

175
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,020
Thank you very much.

176
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,860
Thank you very much, God!

177
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,310
I'm no longer known by that name.

178
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,090
You were all forced to work in a place like
this for six long years. I'm sorry.

179
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,620
We lost Angel Island, the home we
were supposed to return to.

180
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,070
The Shandians, too, lost their
home,Village Hidden in the Clouds.

181
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,730
Is the battle really over?

182
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,560
God's army is gone, but...

183
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,780
Chief, is the 400-year rift something
that can be filled so easily?

184
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,310
Boy, I stuffed myself!

185
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,770
It's totally night now.

186
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,980
Shall we go back to the ship now?

187
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,610
Nami, what're you saying?!

188
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,950
Huh?! If we go back to the ship,

189
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,610
we can have a long relaxed sleep
in a warm bed, right?!

190
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,860
Hey Usopp, you heard what she said?

191
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,830
Yeah, it's terrible. Not
thinking anything after seeing that,

192
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,320
you're unqualified to Be a
pirate-- no, to be a human!

193
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,430
"That"? What're you talking about?!

194
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,490
What the heck are you talking about?!

195
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,630
I'm returning... to where God should be...

196
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,770
Things that obstruct my field of
vision cannot exist in the sky.

197
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,180
You all were in my way.

198
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,370
I won't let anyone have
it. It's fit just for me.

199
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,530
It's a boundless land, just like a dream.

200
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,800
Now, let's set off, Maxim...

201
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,290
To God's world that floats
brightly in the night...

202
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,280
To the land without end, the Endless Vearth!!

203
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,210
Where am I?

204
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,850
Inside the ruins of Shandora.

205
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,900
Gan Fall!

206
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,250
Oh, you shouldn't move yet.

207
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,330
You... are a Skypiean!

208
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,600
Rest.

209
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,260
Chief! Were we captured by the Skypieans?

210
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,160
There's no distinction
among those injured in battle.

211
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,090
The golden belfry... We still have the
duty to protect it to the end!

212
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,640
This is...

213
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,640
...the sound of drums announcing a battle!

214
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,100
There's fire on the ruins, too?!

215
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,860
Don't rush, Wyper. Wait a little and
see how things turn out.

216
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:25,710
No matter what kind of heroic reason for the
fight there was in the distant past,

217
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,330
to us who live in the present
time,this sky is our home.

218
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,200
The land, at least, is not refusing anyone.

219
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,710
But at this very moment, there's actually...

220
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,670
Right... Go ahead and check
it with your own eyes.

221
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,960
Right now, no one wants to fight.

222
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,490
It's party time!!

223
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

224
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens as you wander about

225
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,you
keep your gaze constant

226
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection
wanes as you slowly disappear

227
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

228
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who
spend countless nights drifting

229
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

230
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

231
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,400
Hold our true motive in
your hearts and speak not of it.

232
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,450
Where did you learn those words?!

233
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,420
So these are the words
engraved on the belfry...

234
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,080
The ancient weapon Poseidon?

235
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,560
Why was Gold Roger...?Could
the Rio Poneglyph be...?!

236
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,230
We're pirates, you know.Now,
let's snatch the gold and run!!

237
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,700
On the next episode of One Piece!

238
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,780
"I Made It Here! The Yarn
the Poneglyphs Spin"

239
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,670
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
