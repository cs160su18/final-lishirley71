00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:07,380
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,290
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,110
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,490
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,390
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,660
The Straw Hats find themselves caught up in
the turmoil and involved in an all-out war.

80
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:59,340
Now, Hordy's merciless plot puts the
Fish-Man Island in unprecedented danger!

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,260
Everything will come to an end soon.

82
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,430
Whether it's Shirahoshi or the
Fish-Man Island or your friends!

83
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,140
A fool like you can't protect anything!

84
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,810
No.

85
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,650
I'll protect them all!

86
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,150
That's what I worked for those 2 years!

87
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:30,200
"A Massive Confused Fight! The Straw
Hats vs. The New Fish-Man Pirates!"

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,050
Protect them all? Don't make me laugh!

89
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,720
You've got such a big mouth,
haven't you, Straw Hat?

90
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,390
I can't believe he'd even harm Decken!

91
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,990
Shirahoshi! Get away!

92
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,780
Draw the Noah away from the island!

93
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,040
It's too late.

94
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,910
What did he mean by "too late"?

95
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,390
Wait a minute!

96
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,180
He just beat Decken, right?

97
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,240
What would happen to the Noah if
Decken dies or loses consciousness?

98
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,450
Decken's power would become ineffective!

99
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,920
And the Noah would fall...

100
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,920
...onto the island!

101
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,340
Why did you kick me?! It hurts!

102
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,430
Shut up or I'll kick your fat ass again!

103
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,520
Even Captain Decken wouldn't
kick me for no reason at all!

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,260
You damn Steamed Bun bastard! How dare you...

105
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,450
...bring Nami-san down with the wind blast!

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,230
This is my payback to you!

107
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,870
--This is for...
--Huh?

108
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,540
...the wind blast that Nami-san took!

109
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,710
Ouch!

110
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,630
Oh no!

111
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,180
Watch out for the wind blast, Nami-san!

112
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,010
A wind blast, again?! Please!

113
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,980
Keep your guard up! Look out!

114
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,150
Something came out from that stick earlier!

115
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,650
Black Ball!

116
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,730
--What is it this time?!
--Is she a magician?

117
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,390
No, don't call me a magician!

118
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,370
Call me a charmer!

119
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,380
Although it's not really a
charm. It's based on science!

120
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,180
Clouds?

121
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,890
Storm Cloud Rod!

122
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,940
Ouch!

123
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,630
Help me!

124
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,530
Stay away! I don't wanna
become a dried squid-ch!

125
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,370
--Damn that woman!
--Hey, Ikaros.

126
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,870
That guy in the black suit was overreacting
because that woman got hurt.

127
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,550
I think that woman may be
the Straw Hat's weak link.

128
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,440
Really?

129
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,650
I'll hold her legs and you
kill her with your spear!

130
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,600
I got it-much!

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,270
Well, if you don't wanna
get burned, leave me alone!

132
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,360
What?

133
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,200
I can't move my feet!

134
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,150
You're gonna become a dried squid-ch!

135
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,920
W-W-Wait a minute!

136
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,200
Why can't I move my feet?! Somebody!

137
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,910
Nami-san! Oh yeah!

138
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,210
Take this! The Squid Spear!

139
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,890
Could I look at your panties...

140
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,030
No!

141
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,020
Is he on their side?

142
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,100
Why don't you dry up?
Become a dried squid-ch!

143
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,980
Huh?

144
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,130
Hm? What's wrong-ch?

145
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,650
Suck all the fluid out of
his body and dry him up-ch!

146
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,360
Hey, Squid! What's up?

147
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,740
What's wrong? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

148
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,910
Why?!

149
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,420
Excuse me.

150
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,920
I'm pretty dried up already.

151
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
What?!

152
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,050
I don't believe you-ch!

153
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:43,010
It's a long story. How I
became a dried-up skeleton.

154
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,300
I don't believe you-ch!

155
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,980
--No, believe me. It was over 50 years ago...
--Help me!

156
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,440
Hey hey, isn't there anybody
who is strong enough to fight?!

157
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,800
Huh?

158
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,960
Are you all right?

159
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,370
Who are you-ch?!

160
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,920
It's me!

161
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,420
--I don't know you-ch!
--What?! You don't know this super robot?!

162
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,800
Hm? You must be one of their officers, huh?

163
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,400
Then I bet you have backbone.

164
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,520
Though I'm a squid, I'm still
a Fish-Man! I have backbone!

165
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,270
Oh, he has a backbone
even though he's a squid!

166
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,840
Sympathy!

167
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,230
That's not what he meant.

168
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,450
Hey, Skeleton, get out of there already.

169
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,660
Huh? Why?

170
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,490
Your foot! Your foot!

171
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,240
What about my foot?

172
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,800
You're stepping on him!

173
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,390
Huh? What is he?! I couldn't
move because of him?!

174
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,170
Um... Who are you?

175
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,880
How did you like it?!

176
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,930
What?

177
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,220
Getting a head-butt to
the bottom of your foot!

178
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,890
--What?
--Huh?

179
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,810
It may take some time for
you to feel the pain!

180
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,120
What?!

181
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,070
He doesn't wanna admit
that  he got stepped on!

182
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,740
Sorry that I stepped on your face!

183
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,950
Don't say that!

184
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,830
This technique allows me to give you a
head-butt to the bottom of your foot!

185
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,840
It's called Super Sole Head-Butt!

186
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,750
He named it!

187
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,330
Where did you go, Coral
Head?! I'll bite you good!

188
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,060
No one can beat me in the
ground. I can move freely!

189
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,460
Daruma-san!

190
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,600
Don't make too many tunnels in the ground!

191
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,810
We're all gonna fall into them!

192
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,450
Yes!

193
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,320
Chopper! Did you finish it?

194
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,490
Come out this way!

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,540
What a fool! That guy is off his guard-dogon!

196
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,830
I'm gonna beat him up!

197
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,920
Hey, Chopper? Can't he hear me?

198
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Get squashed and go to hell-zugan!

199
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,260
Usopp! Get down!

200
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,660
Horn Cannon Elf!

201
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,690
Nice, Chopper! Did you
connect all the tunnels?

202
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,630
Yes, it's nice and ready!

203
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,020
All right! Here we go!

204
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,490
Special Attack - Green Star!

205
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,370
Skull Bombgrass!

206
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,760
How did you like that?!

207
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,470
We fought a ground digger
once in Alabasta already!

208
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,450
Our experience gave us the upper hand!

209
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,350
Yeah!

210
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,310
Damn you coral monster!

211
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,430
Is this all your doing?

212
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,880
I'll show you my extraordinary power!

213
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,280
Speaking of power, I have
one up my sleeve, too.

214
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,700
I'm gonna bite your nose off!

215
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,880
Try it if you like!

216
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
Back me up, Chopper!

217
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,850
Hey, back me up!

218
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,290
Oh?

219
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,630
Chopper?

220
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,340
Now, it's my turn!

221
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,790
Damn you! You made me angry!

222
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,420
I won't forgive you even if you say sorry!

223
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,740
I'm gonna beat you up!

224
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,590
Great! That's how a swordsman should be!

225
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,550
You're strong!

226
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,430
--Help me...
--Are you okay? I'll treat you right away!

227
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,750
--Honey, stay with me!
--Daddy!

228
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,810
Treat him now!

229
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,800
Damn Hordy! He can't do
this to unarmed citizens!

230
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,170
Is the Princess okay?

231
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,200
I don't know...

232
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,790
But I'm sure she's still fighting for us!

233
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,510
Madam Sharley!

234
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,000
What's gonna happen to the island?!
Is it really gonna fall?!

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,330
That Straw Hat pirate guy will
save the island, won't he?

236
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,070
Won't he, Madam Sharley?!

237
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,280
--Let's pray.
--What?

238
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,090
All we can do now is pray for the
safety of the Princess and the others.

239
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,620
Pray that they will save the Fish-Man Island!

240
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,870
Go further! More!

241
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,270
She's desperate!

242
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,270
Stay away from the island!

243
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,110
Noah!

244
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,910
Shirahoshi!

245
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,200
If the Noah falls,  everything
will be destroyed!

246
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,870
--Oh no! She couldn't hear us!
--Don't go up!

247
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,580
Turn to the side! You have
to change your course!

248
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,170
They noticed!

249
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,670
Shirahoshi!

250
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,670
Shark Slicer!

251
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,300
Brother!

252
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,850
Ryuboshi!

253
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,640
Don't mess with my plan!

254
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,590
Brother! Stay with me!

255
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,600
Decken's power must have
become ineffective by now.

256
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,900
That's why I stabbed him.

257
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,760
I see!

258
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,910
If she just keeps going up, the
ship could fall onto the island!

259
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,370
Then, Yowahoshi's effort to draw
the ship away means nothing!

260
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,330
Brother-hoshi, let's catch up with Yowahoshi!

261
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,670
Alright!

262
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,210
Shirahoshi!

263
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,130
Yowahoshi!

264
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,890
You can't go any further!

265
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,880
The Fish-Man Island will be destroyed
along with all the islanders!

266
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,600
And Straw Hat,

267
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,820
I'll make sure that all
of your friends are dead!

268
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,220
Are you all right?

269
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,740
Shirahoshi!

270
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,350
Turn to the side!

271
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,660
Shirahoshi!

272
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,720
Shirahoshi!

273
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,470
Yowahoshi!

274
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,970
Stupid Mermaid!

275
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,060
That little shit!

276
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,560
--She heard you!
--She turned to the side!

277
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,190
How annoying!

278
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,190
You can't do that!

279
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,070
Wait!

280
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,820
Let go of me!

281
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,410
I won't let you go after her!

282
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,080
Damn you!

283
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,040
Noah! Come this way!

284
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,250
I can't hold on...

285
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,050
Noah! Come after me!

286
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,850
--Let's go!
--Yeah!

287
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,060
Damn you, Decken! Drop dead already!

288
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,850
Dammit.

289
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,650
Hordy that bastard, I won't forgive him!

290
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,970
Noah! I'm right here!

291
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,710
The ship's starting to go sideways!

292
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,330
Good! Keep going, Yowahoshi!

293
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,770
Shirahoshi!

294
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,600
Keep going!

295
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,350
I touched Hordy with my left hand.

296
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,560
You're my target! Don't forget it!

297
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:18,190
I'll drive you into the ground physically
and mentally, until you die!

298
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,780
Noah!

299
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,820
Shirahoshi! Keep going - a little bit more!

300
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,870
There is no point if it
doesn't fall onto the island!

301
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,460
I'll hunt you down... to the ends of hell!

302
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,170
I won't let you go!

303
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,220
Hordy!

304
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,070
A little more to go, Yowahoshi!

305
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,190
Decken!

306
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,190
I will... kill you!

307
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,570
I'll pass through by force!

308
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,860
You can't!

309
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,990
My axe! Hit Hordy!

310
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,660
Shark Slicer!

311
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,160
I will protect!

312
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,210
The Noah is falling!

313
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,850
Just in time!

314
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,720
The Fish-Man Island...

315
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,380
...is in danger!

316
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,290
No!

317
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,980
I win!

318
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,210
The Noah begins to fall again,

319
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,760
and Luffy tries to stop it
to save Fish-Man Island,

320
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,140
but underwater, he's at a
disadvantage as he battles Hordy,

321
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,570
and can't get the upper hand.

322
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,000
Furthermore, the last air
on the Noah's deck is lost,

323
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,560
making Luffy's demise eminent!

324
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

325
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,030
"Luffy Loses the Fight?!
Hordy's Long-Awaited Revenge!"
