Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,610
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

If you want to go to

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,040
your toughness, that's what it takes

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,520
At any cost, One Piece,

It's important not to wake up

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,610

we go!

68
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned

74
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,680
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,940
The Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

78
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,840
the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,830
and landed on Punk Hazard;
an island with

80
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,850
two parts, one burning,
the other frozen.

81
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,580
They learned about the puppet

82
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,800
master of Shinokuni -
Caesar Clown's motive

83
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,670
and along with their pirate
ally - Trafalgar Law,

84
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,500
were drawn into a climactic battle

85
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,000
which ended with Caesar's defeat.

86
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,520
You haven't eaten anything until today,f
have you?

87
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,350
That's my son!

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,150
But it must've been hard!

89
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,760
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore!

90
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,100
Let's hope that everybody
else is okay, too!

91
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,450
Now,

92
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,300
let's keep living, Momonosuke!

93
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,870
Uh-huh.

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,810
Guys!

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,150
Somebody's coming after us.

96
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,170
So...

97
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,230
...you gotta hurry!

98
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,850
It's a banquet!

99
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,330
Thus, they started the victory banquet.

100
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,280
"It's Time to Say Goodbye!
Leaving Punk Hazard!"

101
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,480
Super!

102
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,370
Law.

103
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,820
I know you don't really think that

104
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,760
I'll keep my promise with a pirate like you.

105
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,480
But if you really wanted to silence me,

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,230
there were several occasions
that you could've killed me.

107
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,240
What are you up to,
taking advantage of Straw Hat?

108
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm taking advantage of him?
Maybe he's taking advantage of me.

109
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,310
Which of the Four Emperors
are you talking about?

110
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,820
The Emperor's name is...

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,890
...Kaido, the King of the Beasts!

112
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,010
As long as Shanks is not
the first one to fight,

113
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,890
I have no problem.

114
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,690
Because...

115
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,240
...I plan to beat all
of the Four Emperors!

116
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,010
"Beat all of the Four Emperors"?

117
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,370
We share a mutual interest
but you're underestimating them.

118
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,780
They are the emperors of the sea

119
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,660
who have skirmished over territories
even against Whitebeard himself.

120
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,410
And above all, they say Kaido,
the King of the Beasts

121
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,350
is the strongest creature in the world.

122
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,890
Huh? What? He's not even a human?!

123
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,440
We'll ally with each other
until we kill Kaido.

124
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,290
And our chances of success are...

125
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,510
Well, I'll just say they're really low.

126
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,100
What?! We shouldn't go
along with this, Luffy!

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,060
I see.

128
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,780
Okay, let's do it!

129
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,860
What?!

130
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,740
Wait a minute!

131
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,000
There is no particular reason

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,420
that I didn't kill you, White Chase-ya.

133
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,280
By the way,

134
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,410
I'm thinking about going to Green Bit.

135
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,700
I wonder if I can handle the Straw Hats.

136
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,020
You're doing great!

137
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,530
He can barely lift the kid up!

138
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
Gum-Gum...

139
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,580
...Big-eater!

140
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,580
Brother Luffy, you're big!

141
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,720
--Stretchy!
--Cool!

142
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,920
Mocha, are you alright?

143
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,910
Aren't you cold?

144
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,890
Uh-huh, I'm fine!

145
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,000
You guys are kind of nice!

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,770
Shut up! We are the fearsome Navy G-5!

147
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,150
Law!

148
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,360
It's all ready now!

149
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,710
I thought you guys were
gonna take the tanker.

150
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,920
Well, no, because Nami
and Chopper claimed

151
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,290
we're not going anywhere until
we see the children sailing out.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,220
It's a pain to wait
for other Navy people

153
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,380
so take the tanker with the children.

154
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,300
Get on board, kids!

155
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,650
We're gonna take you home!

156
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,660
There is no need to hurry. One by one.

157
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,130
Take care!

158
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,100
Hey hey, Straw Hats!

159
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,490
If the tanker is ours,

160
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,290
this is the line!

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Don't think of crossing it!

162
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,480
This is the line between good and evil!

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,940
Don't step on it! Stay away!

164
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,400
Again?! You were enjoying the banquet
a few minutes ago.

165
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,490
No, no! No, idiot!

166
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,970
About that, we really...

167
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,210
...Thank you for the meal!

168
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,150
But you guys are pirates!
A dishonor to the human race!

169
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,940
Looks like they're leaving.

170
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,200
1, 2, 3!

171
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,530
Hm? What's that?

172
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,430
Big Sis Nami!

173
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,160
Chopper-chan!

174
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,320
--Where is the robot?
--Oh? Where are the pirates?

175
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,320
Take that down! How annoying!

176
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,660
It's a barrier!

177
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,540
Even just looking at pirates hurts your eyes!

178
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,160
You guys are not so
different from us, G-5!

179
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,860
But they got on board safely.

180
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,520
Hey!

181
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,740
--Brother!
--Sis!

182
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

183
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,670
We are the champions of justice!

184
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,210
And we're gonna exterminate all pirates
who cause civilians grief!

185
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,060
Pirates are the scum of the world!

186
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,260
And we're men of justice!
Don't let the kids see them!

187
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,420
--Sis!
--Robot!

188
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,020
No! You shouldn't see them!

189
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,200
--Brother!
--Where are you?!

190
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,740
You don't wanna see them!

191
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,630
--They lifted it up!
--Move it!

192
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,600
I can't see them!

193
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,340
You shouldn't see them, brats!

194
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,590
It's nice to see them well
and yelling like that.

195
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,970
She said she'll ask Vegapunk for
assistance about their treatment.

196
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,980
Oh yeah?! That's great!

197
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,860
Franky, I've been thinking.

198
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,990
What happened to the Mini-Merry
after we took it to get to the island?

199
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,400
Oh, Robin! You're the fifth person
to ask that question.

200
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,250
Don't make eye-contact
with those trashy pirates!

201
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,690
It'll ruin your eyes!

202
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,800
But we Navy won't let it happen!

203
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,770
We're men of justice!

204
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,920
Run, guys!

205
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,640
The deadly gas from earlier!

206
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,080
What?!

207
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,160
Run if you don't wanna die!

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,850
We're... men of justice!

209
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,080
The spiral-eyebrowed brother!

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,710
The Navy's in our way!

211
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,460
Move!

212
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,150
If you wanna say goodbye to
pirates, you're a bad kid!

213
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
If you say "Thank you" to them,

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,130
we'll drag you out of the
tanker and leave you here!

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,270
Listen! Pirates are bad
and the Navy is good!

216
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,420
Pirates have been causing
so much chaos in the world!

217
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,510
You should know that even
if you're just a kid!

218
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,310
We'll never forgive pirates!
Because we should not!

219
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,260
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!
Pirates are unforgivable!

220
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,160
We don't want pirates!
Say "No" to pirates!

221
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,690
We don't want pirates!
Pirates are unforgivable!

222
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,060
We don't want pirates!
Say "No" to pirates!

223
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,540
We don't want pirates!

224
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,110
But when we asked them to help us,

225
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,350
they helped us!

226
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,120
They didn't even know
what was going on with us

227
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,960
but they took us with them
without being bothered by our size!

228
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,610
I wanna go home!

229
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,100
We can go home soon! Hang tight!

230
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,320
There was nothing on the island
and no one had come to help us!

231
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,010
But they came!

232
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,670
I'm sorry!

233
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,400
That we didn't find you sooner!

234
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,670
Pirates stink and they're disgusting!

235
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,320
But the Navy is...

236
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,490
...always clean and beautiful!

237
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,250
Pirates are a bunch of cowards
and they're sloppy!

238
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,150
We don't want pirates!
The Navy is great!

239
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,300
If they don't let us say
"Thank you" to them,

240
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,940
the Navy is...

241
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,910
Wait! I'm sorry!

242
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,110
We don't want pirates!
The Navy is great!

243
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,330
But, in contrast, the Navy is...

244
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,070
...very brave and righteous...

245
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,390
Stop it, you guys!

246
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,180
Shame on you!

247
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,730
B...

248
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,090
But Tashigi-chan,

249
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,210
unless we keep saying bad things about them,

250
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,050
we will start...

251
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,240
liking these outlaws!

252
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,170
E-Even though they're pirates!

253
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,790
They're odd Navy soldiers!

254
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,430
Pirate brothers and sisters!

255
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,290
Thank you for helping us!

256
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,690
When we grow up, we will become...

257
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,590
...Pirates!

258
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,940
Don't!

259
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,570
Take care!

260
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,530
Get good rest!

261
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,410
When you get home,
you deserve to be spoiled by

262
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,150
your father and mother!

263
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,370
Kids! You gotta eat something healthy!

264
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,980
Super!

265
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,570
Alright, shall we go?

266
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,240
The weather is good considering
it's the New World.

267
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,530
But I know the sea will be rough.

268
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,540
Hey, is he coming with us?

269
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,830
Oh yeah! We haven't told
you about the alliance.

270
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,510
Luffy got us involved in trouble again.

271
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,840
Straw Hat! Next time we see you,
we'll take you down!

272
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,580
--You're our enemy next time!
--Be ready for it!

273
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,720
See you!

274
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,710
We will catch you!

275
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,770
Whenever you're ready, Luffy!

276
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,580
Yeah!

277
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,780
Hey you, what's your name?!
Where are you?!

278
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,680
Somebody please help me! I'm on...

279
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,190
...Punk Hazard!

280
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,030
Who are they?

281
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,280
What?!

282
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,360
NHC10.

283
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,200
I detected it in their body.

284
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,950
Although it was just a trace amount,
it's...

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,480
...a drug!

286
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,290
There are children who were

287
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,920
kidnapped two years ago
in this laboratory!

288
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,200
Steal a ship and let's
escape from Punk Hazard!

289
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,100
Wait for me, Caesar!

290
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,820
I'll beat you up and kidnap you!

291
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,280
Mocha!!

292
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,160
Catch me if you can! But I'm protected!

293
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,150
Doflamingo! The Four Emperors!

294
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,670
Do you even have balls to
pick a fight with them?

295
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,770
A fight?

296
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,210
I've been...

297
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,560
...picking fights all along!

298
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,770
Caesar!

299
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,480
Gum-Gum...

300
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,030
...Grizzly Magnum!

301
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,420
Let's sail out!

302
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,090
Looks like those squirts
have the devil's luck.

303
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,650
I can't believe the
Sky Path ended there.

304
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,580
Young Master!

305
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,180
Damn! That bastard Law
really betrayed us!

306
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,470
I'm sorry-dasuyan!
I want to pay for it with death!

307
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,040
You needed me but I couldn't please you!

308
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,010
This is a life yacht
that was on our tanker.

309
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,640
I'm so ashamed-dasuyan!
After I hung up...

310
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,470
It's okay. You don't have to explain.

311
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,650
You two were just following my orders.

312
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,880
What a surprise.

313
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,980
I didn't expect the boss
himself to show up!

314
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,080
Is that Law?

315
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
I haven't seen you for a while.

316
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,250
It's a shame that you're not here.

317
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,240
If you're looking for
Caesar, he's with me.

318
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,860
J-Joker! Help me!

319
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,270
Where are Baby 5 and Buffalo's bodies?

320
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,720
I don't know.

321
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,640
Don't ask me about
such frivolous things.

322
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,700
Let's negotiate.

323
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,600
Hey Law, come to your senses.

324
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,690
A squirt like you shouldn't
imitate what grown-ups do.

325
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,800
Where are you now?
Don't make me mad.

326
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,640
Make you mad?

327
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,130
Your most important business partner is
one of the Four Emperors.

328
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,970
The big-time pirate - Kaido,
the King of the Beasts.

329
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,240
And I know you can't make
him mad at any cost.

330
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,480
What would happen if he finds out
you can't produce SMILE anymore?

331
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,190
Since he's not the negotiating type,
there'll probably be a fierce battle.

332
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,690
Young Master, you're turning blue.

333
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,940
And he'll destroy you.

334
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,620
Hey, you carried the joke too far, Law.

335
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,940
What do you want in exchange for Caesar?

336
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,570
Name your price.

337
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,440
Resign from the Seven Warlords.

338
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,590
I can't believe this squirt-dasuyan!

339
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,440
Then he can no longer stay in Dressrosa!

340
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,160
All I want is for you
to abandon everything

341
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,970
that you spent a decade to attain

342
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,390
and go back to being
a common pirate again.

343
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,020
In that case, however,

344
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,760
the Admirals from the Navy HQ
will hunt you down!

345
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,020
I'm expecting to see it in the newspaper
tomorrow morning.

346
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:37,400
If your resignation from the Warlords is
in the paper,

347
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,370
I will call you.

348
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,280
If I don't see it, the
negotiation is off.

349
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,980
Goodbye.

350
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,090
Clank.

351
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,550
Wait a minute! Law!

352
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,000
Young Master!

353
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,330
Damn squirt!
