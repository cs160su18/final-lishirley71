We are the one! Go ahead!

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050

there will be a chain of
burning, intense excitement!

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,690
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,740
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,960
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,170
Usopp knocked Sugar out

77
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,690
and freed the toys who had
been forced to labor as slaves

78
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,550
but Doflamingo trapped everybody in the country
in the Birdcage.

79
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,750
Think!

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,630
You either come to kill me or
side with us Don Quixote Family

81
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,540
and punish the 12 fools who rebel against me.

82
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,580
If you make the wrong decision,
the game will not end.

83
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,810
I'll pay 100 million berries
for each star rating!

84
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,260
100 million berries?!

85
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,300
These are the criminals in Dressrosa!

86
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,440
First, the One-stars...

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,310
REBECCA
A CONVICT GLADIATOR OF THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM
(KING RIKU'S GRANDDAUGHTER)

88
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,990
NICO ROBIN - A PIRATE OF THE STRAW HATS
"DEMON CHILD"

89
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,610
FOXFIRE KIN'EMON - A SAMURAI
FROM THE WANO KINGDOM

90
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,200
VIOLA - THE FORMER PRINCESS OF DRESSROSA

91
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,880
CYBORG FRANKY - A PIRATE OF THE STRAW HATS

92
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,400
Next, the Two-stars...

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,990
KYROS - THE FORMER ARMY
COMMANDER OF DRESSROSA

94
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,860
PIRATE HUNTER ZORO - A
PIRATE OF THE STRAW HATS

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,710
And as for key figures of each group,

96
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,020
I give them three stars!

97
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,000
SABO - THE CHIEF OF STAFF
OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,790
STRAW HAT LUFFY - A PIRATE
THE CAPTAIN OF THE STRAW HATS

99
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,520
TRAFALGAR LAW - THE CAPTAIN OF "THE HEART PIRATES"
THE WARLORD(TENTATIVE), "SURGEON OF DEATH"

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,270
RIKU DOLDO III - THE FORMER KING OF DRESSROSA

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,080
Plus, there is the man who
pissed me off the most today!

102
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,300
It's all his fault that you people have to
play such a bloody game!

103
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,090
The one who kills him will get...

104
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,060
...500 million berries!

105
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,630
"GOD" USOPP - A PIRATE OF THE STRAW HATS

106
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,670
F... Five...

107
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,890
Soldier-san?! He turned back
to a human, too, didn't he?!

108
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,590
Tell me, Lucy, what kind of a man is he?!

109
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,710
What kind of a man?!
What are you talking about?!

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,850
That one-legged soldier was...

111
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,390
...your father!

112
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,460
Until the day you are filled with happiness,

113
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,140
I will always be by your side!

114
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,500
I thought so...

115
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,220
I promise I'll kick Doflamingo's ass for you!

116
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,400
So stay with my friends!

117
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,390
I'm gonna bring an end to
this stupid game in no time!

118
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,100
So survive! Okay?!

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,030
Uh-huh!

120
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,610
"Breaking through Enemy Lines!
Luffy and Zoro Launch the Counter-Attack!"

121
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,250
Luffy, who are you with now?

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm with Zoro and Tra-guy. And...

123
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,360
Riku Doldo III, and I'm Viola.

124
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,660
--What?!
--King Riku-sama!

125
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,860
Viola-sama's there, too?!

126
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,290
Okay, so there are five of you.
On my side, we have...

127
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,720
What?!

128
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,190
What's wrong, Robin?

129
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,920
Anyway, I'm going to move there
with Usopp and Rebecca.

130
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,490
Do you know what you're doing,
Straw Hat-ya?

131
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,340
Our plan was to destroy the SMILE factory

132
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,170
and provoke a conflict between
Doflamingo and Kaido.

133
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,410
But if we kill Doflamingo now,

134
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,930
Kaido will direct all his anger over losing SMILEs,

135
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,720
...at us!

136
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,460
Then we'll have to fight face-to-face
with the angry Emperor!

137
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,130
That's not an issue now.

138
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,270
Take a good look at this country!
If I stop now, what's gonna happen to it?!

139
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,280
Look for the criminals!

140
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,590
Catching them is the only
way for us to survive!

141
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,620
--Did you find one?!
--No, I didn't see any of them!

142
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,530
When you find the criminals,
tell everyone immediately!

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,700
Somebody, stop me!

144
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,240
That was close! Don't let your guard down!

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,340
I can't control my body!

146
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,740
Poor people...

147
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,390
Keep walking!

148
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,720
Issho-san, don't we need
to capture Doflamingo?

149
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,210
Restrain as many out-of-control
people as possible

150
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,330
and focus on Straw Hat and
Law's pirate alliance!

151
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,100
What?!

152
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,650
Send that message to all units!

153
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,570
Alright, let's go!

154
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,760
Wait! I'm still cuffed!

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,970
They'll come off.

156
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,780
No, they won't!

157
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,650
--I'm gonna get the key!
--Do you know where it is?!

158
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,920
When we fell, I saw...

159
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,750
It must be somewhere on this plateau!

160
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,210
I'll find it and... What?!

161
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,780
How should we get there?

162
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,380
Go straight!

163
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,550
--Is he gonna jump off?!
--No way!

164
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,570
Wait for me, Doflamingo!

165
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,990
So many people are coming out of
the basement of the Colosseum!

166
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,190
Wh-What the hell is going on?!

167
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,290
Because of the geographical shift,
the basement has surfaced to the ground above!

168
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,150
I bet they are the ones who were forced
to work at the underground port!

169
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,920
Soldiers!

170
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,590
Officials!

171
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,420
Pirates!

172
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,990
I-I can't believe that many people
were enslaved, unnoticed by anyone!

173
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,200
Where's Straw Hat?

174
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,320
Maynard!

175
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,000
Who told you to fight in
the competition-dara?!

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,670
That was out of line!

177
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,080
You could have been killed!

178
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,820
But Bastille-san, I got to see everything
that's been going on here because of it!

179
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,510
MAYNARD THE PURSUER
A VICE ADMIRAL OF THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS
(A CONTENDER OF THE GLADIATORIAL COMPETITION)

180
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,640
If we can take Doflamingo into custody,

181
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,530
the world may turn for the
better, even if only a little!

182
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,500
Where's Issho-san?!

183
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,690
IN THE UNDERGROUND TRADE PORT

184
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,650
I'm glad to be back.

185
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,230
I can conduct investigations
without any interruption.

186
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,560
These are...

187
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,440
This trading ship from the

188
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,490
Kingdom of Biggschots has been
disguised as a pirate ship.

189
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,290
This port seems like a place where
secrets from various countries come together.

190
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,850
What are we gonna do after all of that?!

191
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,870
There are a bunch of Navy soldiers out there!

192
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,250
We're in big trouble once they find out about
our trade with Doflamingo!

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,110
I know! That's why we came back!

194
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,350
But we can't get out of here with the ship
because of...

195
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,760
We just need to destroy all the evidence.

196
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,150
Along with this ship!

197
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,700
--Alright? Now get down to it!
--Yes, sir!

198
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,540
I won't let you do that!

199
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,040
Who are you?!

200
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,260
Boy...

201
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,900
You can't burn all this crucial evidence!

202
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,100
Don't do it!

203
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,950
--I-I'm sorry!
--Honey!

204
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,020
Guys! Get away from me!

205
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,510
Why, Issho-san?!

206
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,490
Doflamingo can't keep his position
as a Warlord after this!

207
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,000
We have to capture him now!

208
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,650
The Navy has been doing

209
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:07,130
the same thing over and
over again just like that!

210
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,500
You have been in the Navy for a long time
haven't you, Vice Admiral-san?

211
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,670
Weren't you even listening all this time?

212
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,300
To these screams filled with anger?

213
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,500
They are not crying! They are angry!

214
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,610
Does the World Government...

215
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,860
pretend to be God or something?!

216
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,830
I need you to honor my decisions.

217
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,670
Law and the others' target
is the SMILEs, isn't it?

218
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,520
Hey Doffy! Don't we have
to protect the factory?

219
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,940
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE
(THE SUNFLOWER FIELD)

220
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,780
They can't open the doors.

221
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,230
They're all made of Sea Prism Stone.

222
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,470
And I have the keys to the factory here.

223
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,190
What?!

224
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,000
--Young Master-sama?!
--You know what you're doing?!

225
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,360
The enemies don't need hope.

226
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,780
How powerless.

227
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,820
I can't believe you couldn't even
protect this little girl, Trebol.

228
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,090
Shut up, "g"eezer!
She's not really a little girl!

229
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,960
Hey hey, Doffy!
I'm really sorry about Sugar!

230
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,720
I didn't expect a guy with his hands
and feet bound would knock out Sugar!

231
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,810
--How could I see it coming?
--The same can be said for the Flare-Flare Fruit!

232
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,710
I didn't expect the No.2 of the Revolutionary Army

233
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,550
was fighting in the competition.

234
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,250
How could I know?!

235
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,150
Right, right!

236
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,970
Don't make excuses!
How ungraceful! Idiots!

237
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,770
Un"g"raceful... There's the "G"!

238
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,030
Let bygones be bygones.

239
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,870
Even if I blame you two,
we can't change the past.

240
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,060
Right! That's our boss!

241
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,790
Nice try, Lao G!

242
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,080
I'll let you forgive me if you insist!

243
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,720
But Doffy, when it comes down
to it, the Navy is an obstacle.

244
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,150
What should we do with Fujitora?

245
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,870
I already talked to him.

246
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,850
The Navy won't come after us.

247
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,240
But once we've done using Fujitora,

248
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,560
he needs to be taken out.

249
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,770
I will take care of you after that!

250
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,870
What do you say?

251
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,790
I'm just a newcomer
picked through the World Military Draft

252
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,280
but since being appointed as a Navy admiral,
there is something I want to do.

253
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,820
The complete abolition of
the Seven Warlord system!

254
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,840
There's no advantage of keeping him alive.

255
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,990
I don't think it's gonna be easy though.

256
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,620
Listen!
Restrain all those people who are out of control!

257
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,120
Find the Straw Hats and Trafalgar Law!

258
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,060
Yes, sir!

259
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,740
The Navy is not antagonizing us-in, it seems!

260
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,390
Do they really wanna treat the
Young Master as a Warlord?

261
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,420
That's a little too lenient, isn't it?

262
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,980
Ah! Maybe they feel threatened by
the Birdcage, don't you think?!

263
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,310
That aside, that pervert,

264
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,300
I can't believe he still had
the energy to run away.

265
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,750
Where the hell did he go?

266
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,480
"Where did he go"? He's wounded so bad!

267
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,380
He must've been taken out by
the people who are controlled

268
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,800
by the Young Master by now-in, I bet!

269
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,370
He's not that weak.

270
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,170
Didn't you guys feel that guy's iron will?

271
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,270
I intend to keep wrecking
the place for no reason!

272
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,290
Prepare for it!

273
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,630
Half-hearted attacks won't bring him down.

274
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,130
We have to finish him off for sure this time!

275
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,030
Oh! So hard-boiled!

276
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,230
That must be the SMILE factory!

277
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,120
It's so defenseless!
It's practically begging to be shot at!

278
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,720
A balloon is falling from the sky-in!

279
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,170
A balloon?

280
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,710
If you don't wanna get hurt, stand back,
you little tramps!

281
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,640
Law!

282
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,570
How could you show your face here
after everything, you shitty brat?

283
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,120
Brother Law?
Well, I barely remember him.

284
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,000
--H-Hey!
--That's...

285
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,940
Straw Hat Luffy!

286
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,530
Trafalgar Law!

287
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,500
Pirate Hunter!

288
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,940
This is the worst spot to land!

289
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,910
Hey, Straw Hat!
When I get uncuffed, I'm gonna kill you first!

290
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,670
I tell you, there is no
good spot to land here

291
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,530
since everybody in this country is our enemy!

292
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,180
Anyway, we've gotta run!

293
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,080
Okay!

294
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,400
Chase them, chase them!

295
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,570
Zoro, that's not the way!

296
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,870
Straw Hat, it's not this way either!

297
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,380
--We found the criminals!
--Two Three-stars and one Two-star!

298
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,860
Don't let them get away!

299
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,780
Stop!

300
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,750
Ah! Brother Law! It's so nice to see you!

301
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,090
Who is he? Do you know him?

302
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,400
That's Dellinger! Don't
underestimate him! He's...

303
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,810
Not bad!

304
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,120
I got caught!

305
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,920
The strange guy came swimming in the ground!

306
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,620
Do it, Vise!

307
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,980
Run! He's a super weight human!

308
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,700
What?! Damn! Let go of my feet!

309
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,570
Ton Ton! Ten-Ton Vise!

310
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,310
I can't pull them out! My feet are stuck!

311
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm not gonna miss it this time!

312
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,470
Pistol High-Heel!

313
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,970
Too heavy!

314
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,830
Ouch!

315
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,860
Great! My feet were released!

316
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,800
Watch out this time! Let's go!

317
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,050
We'll take the money!
Your heads are worth 800 million in total!

318
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,000
Prepare to die!

319
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,000
Shoot!

320
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,550
There are the Two-star and Three-stars!

321
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,140
Damn! They're pains in the ass!

322
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,370
But is it okay to chop them up?
There are some civilians, too!

323
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,060
Okay, I'll use my Haki to...

324
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,400
Stop it.

325
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,950
He who shoots oft at last
shall not hit the mark.

326
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,740
The Navy admiral!

327
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,040
The gambling old man!

328
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,200
Luffy and Zoro clash with Fujitora!

329
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,450
And in the midst of the fierce fight,

330
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,640
the silent top executive Pica
emerges from the ground...

331
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,520
...with a rumbling that
shakes up heaven and earth,

332
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,580
showing, at last, the
extent of his strength!

333
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,970
His tremendous power that
can destroy the whole town

334
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,980
bears down on Luffy and the others!

335
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

336
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,200
"With a Rumbling of the Ground!
The God of Destruction - Giant Pica Descends!"

337
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
