2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,000
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Countless pirates fight desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,540
the great treasure left behind by Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,620
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,680
also takes to the sea to become the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,400
As Luffy and his friends overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,120
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,320
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,440
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,360
While Buggy and Mr. 3 ascended to level 4 in order to break out,

50
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,940
the moribund Luffy was injected with a Healing Hormone by Ivankov,

51
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,660
which will cure him, but rob him of 10 years of life!

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,260
Food!

53
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm...

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,740
...recovered!

55
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,700
"Luffy's Back! Ivan-san Begins the Breakout Plan!!"

56
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,780
Wow! He absorbed all the energy!

57
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,380
What a guy! You must be superhuman!

58
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,580
He has overcome Magellan's poison! I can't believe it!

59
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,180
He recovered after only 20 hours!

60
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,680
This must be a miracle!

61
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,800
Miracle? It's something far greater than that!

62
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,440
You did it! You did it! You did it! You did it!

63
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,100
You did it! You did it!

64
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm so glad!

65
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,580
Oh, Bon-chan! I'm so happy you survived!

66
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,780
What?! Are you kidding?! Gimme a break!

67
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,960
You're the one that made me worry....

68
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,820
Bon-chan! Hey!

69
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,260
You alright?! Hey!

70
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,480
What happened to you? Hey!

71
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,680
He's just exhausted! But it's not because of his wounds!

72
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,520
Oh, Ivan-chan!

73
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,270
Ivan-chan?!

74
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,060
I made it! Thank you for helping both of us!

75
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,100
If you wanna thank someone, you better thank Mr. 2 Bon boy, not me!

76
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,760
I only nudged you along with my powers.

77
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,320
But him,

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,540
he was struggling alongside you for hours and hours and hours here!

79
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,200
He lost his voice and spewed up blood but he didn't stop!

80
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,660
He kept shouting "Hang in there!" "You have to live!" to you!

81
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,230
I think it somehow affected your recovery!

82
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,320
I see.

83
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,620
--What's wrong with him?
--Is he naked?!

84
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,240
Straw-chan, I come to rescue you!

85
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,660
In the name of friendship!

86
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,960
Who the hell is this guy all covered in blood?!

87
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,180
Earlier, I was...

88
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm sorry that I ran!

89
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,720
How do you know this guy?

90
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,700
I'm his friend!

91
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,720
Straw-chan! I'm not gonna let you die!

92
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,160
Bon-chan, thank you! I'm really grateful!

93
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,680
Here are your hat and clothes. But you're not ready yet.

94
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,660
You need to rest for several days to be fully recovered.

95
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,900
I don't have time! I've already wasted too much!

96
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,680
Sorry, but can you look after Bon-chan? I'll be back for him later!

97
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,580
--Hey, hey!
--See? You're not completely well yet!

98
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,220
The paper is still pointing down! Ace must be downstairs!

99
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,220
By the way, where am I now?

100
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,600
What's that?

101
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,980
It's a Vivre Card, isn't it?

102
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,320
You're on a floor between level 5 and 6.

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,060
I bet that since you've recovered,

104
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,340
you wanna go to rescue your brother no matter what.

105
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Well, it's your life! You can do whatever you want!

106
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,420
What about you, Ivan-chan? Are you gonna break out?

107
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,820
Bon-chan thought he'd help your butt get out of here.

108
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,580
Your butt?!

109
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,360
Can you guide me to Ace on your way out?

110
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,800
What did you just say? Bon boy came here to save me?

111
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,540
Oh, I didn't know that. That's really sweet of him.

112
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,400
But I don't need to be saved.

113
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,640
It's not time to break out yet!

114
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,960
I know what's going on in the world now.

115
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:22,100
The world is about to change with the Navy and the Whitebeard Pirates as major players!

116
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,720
But he's not gonna make a move yet!

117
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,200
He's the mastermind of all revolutionaries in the world and my comrade!

118
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,500
The revolutionary--Dragon!

119
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,760
Oh, you're talking about my dad.

120
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,340
Yes. When your father makes a move with his army,

121
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,420
then I'll reappear and enter the world again!

122
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,560
If I escaped now, I'd just end up on countless wanted lists around the world!

123
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,380
D-D-D-D... Dad?!

124
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,410
Did he say "my dad?!"

125
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,040
What?!

126
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,940
Dragon is...

127
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,420
...your dad?!

128
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,060
D-D-D-Don't be ridiculous!

129
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,700
You're a son of Dragon?! He has a son?!

130
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,560
Oh! I shouldn't have said anything.

131
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,860
I guess it's okay. Grandpa didn't keep it a secret.

132
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,160
Your father's name is...

133
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,500
...Monkey D. Dragon! He's a revolutionary!

134
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,790
I don't really know about him. I've never even seen his face.

135
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,940
What?!

136
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,820
This seems legitimate!

137
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,060
He doesn't seem to be the kind to lie and he's a new star in the world of pirates!

138
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,540
And I've just seen his extraordinary vital force!

139
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,360
He's not a normal man! So it's believable!

140
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,720
Where did you come from?!

141
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm from the East Blue!

142
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,640
Dragon.

143
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,060
Whenever you go for some air,

144
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,440
you always face towards the same direction no matter where you are!

145
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,940
Do I? Why would you be so curious about such a thing?

146
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,280
I've never noticed.

147
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,240
Then, it must be a homing instinct like animals have.

148
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,960
Is your home in that direction?

149
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,540
You're thinking about your family in the east,

150
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,120
aren't you?

151
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,040
Don't be so inquisitive about my past, Ivan!

152
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,060
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:57,220
Oh no! If Straw boy is a son of Dragon for real, that means...

154
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,400
Inazuma, check to see when they'll take Ace boy away!

155
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,020
Yes, right away!

156
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,120
There isn't much time!

157
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,780
But the Vivre Card was pointing down which means that he's still here!

158
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,210
I'm gonna go to level 6 with Straw boy now!

159
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,520
What? Are you gonna show me the way?!

160
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,800
But, did you just say "level 6?" Isn't it 5?

161
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,220
It can't be! You're on level 5.5!

162
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,560
Whatever. Alright, let's go!

163
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,560
I wasn't paying attention! It didn't even occur to me!

164
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,680
If Straw boy is Dragon's son, so is Ace!

165
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,360
Is this why the Navy captured Ace?!

166
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,720
No, it can't be! There would be no point in it!

167
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,830
They don't wanna fight Whitebeard and Dragon at the same time!

168
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,340
What does the government truly want?!

169
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,500
In any case, it's time to make a move!

170
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,140
Okay, Bon-chan! I'll be back!

171
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,960
Straw boy!

172
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,560
Don't tell anyone casually about your birth!

173
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,220
Yeah, that's what I thought.

174
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:22,300
I'm a friend of your dad and one of the commanders of the Revolutionaries army!

175
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,140
That's why I was arrested!

176
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,360
So it's my duty to support you whether you like it or not!

177
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,820
I can't let my friend's son die before my eyes!

178
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,920
Tell all the people in the New Kama Land!

179
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:42,980
We're going to rescue Ace boy and try to break out of the prison!

180
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,540
--What are you saying all of the sudden?
--Isn't this a bit hasty?

181
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,660
Decisions must always be sudden!

182
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,060
If you wanna come with me, get ready to die,

183
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,680
prepare for action and wait for us here!

184
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,280
Alright! Let's do it!

185
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,780
I'll follow you, Ivan-sama, to the end!

186
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,560
It's a new beginning for New Kama!

187
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,040
Alright! Wait for me, Ace!

188
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,240
I'm coming for you!

189
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,660
What?!

190
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,500
His pulse...

191
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,620
What?!

192
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,660
His pulse...

193
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,920
...is fine!

194
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,620
That was a joke?!

195
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,040
Because the treatment has just shortened his life,

196
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,140
he must be exhausted still on some level!

197
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,970
Emporio...

198
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,720
...Energy Hormone!

199
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,640
It's a matter of adrenaline!

200
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,860
Now you have enough energy for a day!

201
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:46,080
You'll feel the after effects in several days but I guess it won't matter much at that point!

202
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:59,100
Vice Warden! Warden won't like it if he hears that you've been sitting there!

203
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,810
We'll be sure to tell him later!

204
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,260
You guys are so mean!

205
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,220
Mr. 2, Mr. 3, Buggy the Clown...

206
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,120
Are you sure that they got onto level 5?

207
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,500
Yes, his disguise was perfect!

208
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,320
But the only thing that they found on level 5 was the headdress covered in blood.

209
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,760
We assume that they took Straw Hat out of the cell

210
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,020
but ended up being eaten by the wolves.

211
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,880
I see.

212
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,580
I never thought that I'd wear this special order thing before I became the warden.

213
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,300
I still haven't brought down Magellan!

214
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,040
Don't say it so plainly!

215
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,840
If we get duped or beaten again,

216
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,100
both yours and the Warden's jobs are on the line!

217
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,520
My position, too?!

218
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,100
--Of course!
--Of course!

219
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,260
The Staircase to level 3 must be close!

220
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,580
Level 4 is a breeze!

221
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,940
I haven't seen any jailers at all! They're totally gone!

222
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,960
Let's make a game of it! It's the Buggy and 3 Adventures!

223
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,840
Don't stop suddenly!

224
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,740
Wait a minute!

225
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,500
It's a Surveillance Transponder Snail!

226
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,120
If it finds us, all our efforts will go to waste!

227
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,980
Thank you for noticing it, partner!

228
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,400
Let's go carefully from now on!

229
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,860
What is this?!

230
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,590
M-My eyes are itchy!

231
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,540
This must be Magellan's poison!

232
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,840
That poison that he used against Straw Hat is still in the air here!

233
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,580
Oh no!

234
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,200
The guards will see us through it!

235
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,460
--That was close.
--That was close.

236
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,990
THE ELEVATOR TO LEVEL 6

237
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,200
You were too late!

238
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,920
You're so strict, Domino.

239
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,420
You need to do your business quickly from now on!

240
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,380
That's impossible!

241
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,360
Here it comes again!

242
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,780
Just hold it!

243
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,100
No way!

244
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,460
We need to hand them the prisoner 9 am sharp at the front gate!

245
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,420
That's our mission!

246
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,960
If we can't make it, we'll ruin the honor of Impel Down!

247
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,520
THE FRONT GATE OF IMPEL DOWN

248
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,860
Listen! We'll take Portgaz D. Ace from here and get to...

249
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,340
...the Marineford--Navy Headquarters.

250
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,580
Until the very moment that we hand over the prisoner,

251
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,260
--I need you to pay full attention!
--Yes, sir!

252
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,740
To be prepared for any possibility, we'll convey him strictly with 5 ships...

253
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,180
...under the direction of 5 vice admirals! Do not fail!

254
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,760
Yes, sir!

255
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,140
I dunno why but I'm full of energy!

256
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,060
We gotta hurry! We don't wanna waste even a second!

257
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,620
There's no security here! So we can just run out in the open!

258
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,280
Nothing can stop us now!

259
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,740
What's that?!

260
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,600
Who are they?!

261
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,440
T-That looks like Ivankov! I thought that he was dead!

262
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,140
No way!

263
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,640
Outta my way!

264
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,200
Don't mess with me!

265
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,580
Death...

266
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,640
...Wink!

267
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,780
Inazuma, open it!

268
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,060
Okay!

269
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,260
They'll be monitoring us from now on!

270
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,120
Come and get me if you want!

271
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,080
We have an intruder!

272
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,860
They're at the staircase between level 5 and 6!

273
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,220
Oh! I know this big guy!

274
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,000
He was the king of queers--Ivankov who went missing years ago!

275
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,100
How could this be possible?!

276
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,340
How did he survive all these years?!

277
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,620
And this is the invader from yesterday

278
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,060
I thought that he was killed by the Warden!

279
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,440
And he's another missing prisoner!

280
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,560
A revolutionary from South Blue--Inazuma!

281
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,440
What's going on here?!

282
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
They're heading straight to level 6!

283
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,780
They want to save "Fire Fist" Ace!

284
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,060
Domino-san and Warden Magellan are also heading to level 6 now!

285
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,320
They'll bump into each other!

286
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,340
They are all alive?!

287
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,500
Vice Warden!

288
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,660
Activate passageway traps now!

289
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,510
Call jailers on level 6 and have them clear for action!

290
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,220
They need to hold on until Sadie-chan and the demon guards get there!

291
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,560
And report this to Warden Magellan and all floors!

292
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,040
--That's all! Hurry up!
--Yes, sir!

293
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,860
I've never seen Vice Warden getting so serious!

294
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,680
Maybe it's an imposter again!

295
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,660
We have to get them!

296
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,400
My job is on the line!

297
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,120
No, he's the real one!

298
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,820
We can make it! We can make it!

299
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,220
I'll be there right away, Ace!

300
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,300
Alright, Portgaz D. Ace!

301
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,380
We will take you to Marineford...

302
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,760
...where the execution ground is!

303
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,980
The public execution of Ace is in...

304
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,000
...6 hours!

305
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,880
Luffy finally makes it to the
lowest level of Impel Down, level 6.

306
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,840
However, Ace has already been taken away,
and the cell is empty.

307
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,890
Luffy tries to follow Ace but he's held up by Hannyabal's traps!

308
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

309
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,300
"Ace's Convoy Begins!
Battle on the Lowest Floor Level 6!"

310
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
