00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,660
The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,390
We keep finding the things we
want to do and doing them all

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,570

The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

Yes, Shining! Running! Forever

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

53

iku ze Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,900
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,310
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,270
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,530
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,170
When Luffy found out that the prize for a
fighting event was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

77
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,720
he decided to enter.

78
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,580
Finally, the match for Block C
which Luffy registered for, started!

79
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,330
Brother.

80
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,610
Th-That bastard called me shrimp.

81
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,390
Just put it on already, Bobby!

82
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,860
I heard this strange story, Lucy.

83
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,530
I heard a pirate who's worth 400 million
named Straw Hat Luffy is...

84
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,830
...secretly fighting in this competition.

85
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,380
"The Legendary Pirate!
Don Chinjao!"

86
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,930
Now, the battle for Block C
is reaching its final phase!

87
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,940
Who's gonna win it?!
Take a look at the hot contenders!

88
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,450
The assassin from Mogaro - Kelly Funk!

89
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,090
He is unstoppable now!

90
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,280
Boo has been knocked out completely
after Kelly battered him!

91
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,810
Sai is approaching Boo.

92
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,770
Will the "Eight-Impact
Fist" be defeated here?!

93
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,310
Meanwhile, Ideo is blowing through and

94
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,660
beating tough contenders one after another!

95
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,060
Can't anybody stop this man?!

96
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,600
And Don Chinjao keeps charging
ahead in a fit of anger!

97
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,470
And, and, and,

98
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,000
this guy is stirring things up in this competition!

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,090
Lucy is the center of everybody's attention!

100
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,930
He is now desperately
chasing Jean the Bandit!

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,930
Wait!

102
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,370
You! Cactus! Give me back my helmet!

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,980
Damn that bastard!

104
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,890
Wait, you brat!

105
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,430
Garp's grandson!

106
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,020
Whoa! He's coming after me!

107
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,240
Your grandpa is Garp? So you're really him!

108
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,800
Get out of my way!

109
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,180
Oh? Where is he?

110
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,920
Where did he go?! Garp's grandson!

111
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,490
Give me back my helmet!

112
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,560
They call me Jean the Bandit!
I'd never give back what I stole!

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,100
Oh no! My beard!

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,220
Why are you panicking?

115
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,530
That was close!

116
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,880
Why are you hiding your face?

117
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,040
B-Because...

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,450
You can't say it?

119
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,220
There is only one reason
why you can't say it.

120
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,650
That's because you are...

121
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,350
...Straw Hat Luffy!

122
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,270
Yeah!

123
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,020
No, I'm not! I'm Lucy!

124
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,660
Charitable Donation!

125
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,700
Oh? Where did he go? Where's my helmet?

126
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,700
Hey! Where are you, Cactus?!

127
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,220
I can't believe that
Straw Hat really entered this event.

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,610
But I have a chance to win.

129
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,720
Because there are so many
weapons I can steal.

130
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,590
I know I can beat him with my shooting skill.

131
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,590
I'm gonna collect as many
weapons as I can and...

132
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,300
...I will defeat Straw Hat Luffy!

133
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,670
Cactus... Where did he go?

134
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,790
What?! What? What? What's going on?!

135
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,980
How strong!

136
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,670
The contenders are getting blown
away like sheets of paper!

137
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,420
It's Kelly Funk who is punching them!

138
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,780
Rah-Rah-Rah Rampage!

139
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,430
Where did Bobby go?

140
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,720
Kelly got bigger and surprisingly stronger!

141
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,930
I don't know what is going on anymore!

142
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,190
I saw it! I sure did!
What was that all about?!

143
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,580
He... The one that's fighting right now...

144
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,930
Is he Kelly or Bobby?!

145
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,440
Bobby and Kelly... The two became one!

146
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,910
Jacket-Jacket Two-in-a-Coat!

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,420
Wh-What the hell are they doing?!

148
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,840
Put me on already!

149
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,010
Uh-huh.

150
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,780
What's going on with them?!

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,240
Brother, like I said before,
I don't want to fight.

152
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,270
Idiot! Just stop thinking like always

153
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,970
and put me on!

154
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,540
Bobby was born with such a strong body,

155
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,680
but it was wasted on him - he's such a wimp!

156
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,160
However, when he puts me on as his "skin,"

157
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,990
I can take over his personality

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,270
and show my fighting skills and

159
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,960
brutality at full
with his body!

160
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,970
The guy from earlier?!

161
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm a jacket human
who ate the Jacket-Jacket Fruit!

162
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Whether it's an animal or a monster,

163
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,310
once someone puts me on,
I get control over all of him!

164
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,410
Bobby is wearing me
so we're one in body and mind now!

165
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,690
We're the Funk Brothers!

166
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,290
So you're saying you can't fight on your own!

167
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,010
What did you say to me earlier?

168
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,920
Huh? I'll say it as many times as you want!

169
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,070
You can't fight on your own!

170
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,180
Not that! You called me shrimp!

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,580
Rah-Rah-Rah Rampage!

172
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,490
Rah-Rah-Rah Rampage!

173
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,580
How's that?

174
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,070
Do you realize how strong I am?!

175
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,340
It was over before I knew it!

176
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,150
They're all weak!

177
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,370
Hey!

178
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,970
Oh, you're the older of the brothers
from the Kano Kingdom!

179
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,120
I beat your brother in a second!

180
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,470
We brothers are working together
and killing people for living!

181
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,070
You're so pathetic!

182
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,970
You can't even save your own brother!

183
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,950
He lost because he trained himself poorly.

184
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,100
Don't be so hard on him.

185
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,520
You're gonna get beaten just like he was!

186
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,490
Rah-Rah-Rah Rampage!

187
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,900
Isn't the martial art of
the Kano Kingdom strong?!

188
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,030
Huh?!

189
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,170
You can't even talk because you're
moaning about your brother?!

190
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,640
From the moment I became a disciple
in order to learn the Eight-Impact Fist,

191
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,310
I have had no emotional
attachment to my brother!

192
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,310
But,

193
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,430
as the 13th leader of the Happo Navy,

194
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,660
I will avenge my subordinate!

195
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,560
S...

196
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,730
S...

197
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,530
S...

198
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,100
S...

199
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,560
Strong!

200
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,120
The Eight-Impact Fist!

201
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,480
He showed off what it takes to be the leader!

202
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,130
Nobody could stop the monster, Kelly,

203
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,480
but he took him down with a single kick!

204
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,050
Until we accomplish our true purpose,
I can't lose.

205
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,640
Dammit! Where did he go?

206
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,090
I have no doubt.
You're the strongest in this block.

207
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,000
You should not praise your enemy!

208
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,910
Well, I wanted to face a
strong opponent like you.

209
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,730
What?!

210
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,290
I will defeat you, the strongest here,

211
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,250
and advance to the top!

212
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,160
Shut the fuck up!

213
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,000
Stop!

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Hold on tight, Momo-chan!

215
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,120
Straw Hats! Just give up!

216
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,400
It's not beautiful to keep fighting a losing battle!

217
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,880
With my Art-Art Fruit power,

218
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,370
I turned your ship to an art
piece like this, so now,

219
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,020
you can't get away from Dressrosa!
Can't you see it?!

220
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,460
Hand Momonosuke over to us already!

221
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,280
It's no use trying to get away
leaving your ship behind!

222
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,480
"Get away"?

223
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,210
Hey, where did the others go?!

224
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,090
Where's the skeleton and the raccoon?

225
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,230
Wh-What is it?!

226
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,960
We're here!

227
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,580
Hello!

228
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,030
When did you get there?!

229
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,330
Okay, bye!

230
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,900
Oh? Where did the brat
from the Wano Kingdom go?!

231
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
The woman's gone, too!

232
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,920
What?!

233
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,480
What the hell is this?

234
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,940
I didn't notice those at all!
What are they?!

235
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,650
Thunder clouds?!

236
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,050
Thunderbreed Tempo!

237
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,160
Hey! You people are so annoying!

238
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,170
My submarine! My people!

239
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,140
No matter how tough the situation is,

240
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,200
we're not gonna get away
leaving the Sunny behind!

241
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,110
Now, let's get it back!

242
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,220
Yeah!

243
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,710
Nami-san, you're great! So cool!

244
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,640
Go, Chopper, Brook!

245
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,280
What?!

246
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,070
You're making us fight after all?!

247
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,100
I don't think I can fight
with a body like this!

248
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,650
Help!

249
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,890
Luffy-san!

250
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,340
What?!

251
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,590
Whaaat?!!

252
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,370
Wh-What the hell are you carrying?!

253
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,230
Th-That's a lot!

254
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,250
He collected as many weapons
as he can in the Colosseum!

255
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,320
This is why we call him Jean the Bandit!

256
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,020
Jean Ango is now facing Lucy!

257
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,350
Fight me, Lucy!
I mean...

258
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,490
...Straw Hat Luffy!

259
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,310
Hmmm... If he already knows who I am,
there's nothing I can do.

260
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,780
Then, just give me back my helmet!

261
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,310
Charitable Donation!

262
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,760
I made so much money last
two years thanks to you!

263
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,480
Huh? Thanks to me?

264
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,680
I captured dozens of prisoners

265
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,430
who you set free from the
great prison - Impel Down!

266
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,640
I'm looking to catch
every single one of you escapees!

267
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,870
"Star Clown" Buggy!

268
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,640
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei!

269
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,230
Sir Crocodile!

270
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,060
The Queen of the Queers - Ivankov!

271
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,300
Shiryu of the Rain!

272
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,590
I'll hunt you all down
and make a name for myself!

273
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,640
I wonder how Jimbei and Ivan-chan are doing.

274
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,250
Not just you guys!

275
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,900
There are also brutal
escapees from level 6...

276
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,980
...which they didn't announce to the public.

277
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,300
From level 6?

278
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,300
I know where they are now!

279
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,770
I didn't know there were other escapees.

280
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,070
Damn! Why can't I get him?!

281
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,420
Oh?

282
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,020
Oops...

283
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,690
Give it back.

284
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,050
You bastard!

285
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,490
That hurt.

286
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,630
O-Out of the ring!

287
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,460
Jean the Bandit has been eliminated!

288
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,270
Knocked out at a single blow!

289
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,380
The legendary pirate -
Don Chinjao head-butted him!

290
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
He's still got it after all these years!

291
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,580
Meanwhile, there is a breathtaking fight

292
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,220
going on, between two
equally matched contenders!

293
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,360
They're really a good match-up!

294
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,390
This life-and-death struggle
seems as if they're trying to

295
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,380
figure out which one of them
is the strongest in this event!

296
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,550
They're both overwhelmingly strong!

297
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,780
No one else can compete!

298
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,080
They both take pride in their skills!

299
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,790
This is a battle royal!

300
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,290
--Yeah!
--Fight, fight!

301
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,880
The excitement is reaching its peak!

302
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,830
Go!

303
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,900
This is great!

304
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,220
Ideo!

305
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,670
Sai!

306
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,640
The whole Colosseum is keeping an eye

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,900
on the fight between those two!

308
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,360
It's really getting exciting!

309
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,150
You can't get away now!

310
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,550
Garp's grandson!

311
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,550
Pay for what he did to me, Straw Hat Luffy!

312
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,490
Your obnoxious grandpa took
all of my fortune away!

313
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,220
He also took away my power

314
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,790
and the sweet memories of my younger days!

315
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,160
Like I said before, I don't
know what you're talking about!

316
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,270
Talk to my grandpa!

317
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,510
It's too easy for Garp
if I punish him by death!

318
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:26,240
I will make him feel how painful
it is to live with loss!

319
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,970
Just give up!

320
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,680
Why didn't they put me in Block C?!

321
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,260
I should be the one who kills him -
Straw Hat Luffy!

322
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,020
I have no choice.

323
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,580
Let's do it.

324
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,010
Second Gear!

325
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,080
Even if this weren't a personal matter,

326
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,750
I can't win this thing without beating him.

327
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,160
I won't let anybody have
the Flare-Flare Fruit!

328
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm gonna finish you off
right here, right now!

329
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,070
Outta my way!

330
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,220
Move!

331
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,470
That's what it takes to be a king.

332
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,970
It's a clash of two Conqueror's Haki users.

333
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,230
B-Block C!

334
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,200
There are only...

335
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,630
...two men left!
