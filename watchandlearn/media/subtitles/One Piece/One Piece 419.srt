2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,360
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,620
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,450
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,460
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,100
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,230
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,900
Luffy is heading to the
Great Prison - Impel Down

50
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,110
to rescue his brother Ace, who's
been captured by the navy.

51
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,370
Meanwhile, his friends have
been sent to separate islands.

52
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,380
"The Friends' Whereabouts! An Island
of Giant Birds and a Pink Paradise!"

53
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,630
How many times do I have to tell you?!

54
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,960
M-My shin! You kicked my shin!

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,940
Why couldn't you get it, you blockhead?!

56
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,320
I require at least 100
kilograms of food per meal.

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Anything less than that won't suffice.

58
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,240
Do you want to be turned to stone again?!

59
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,870
N-No! I'm very sorry! I'll be careful!

60
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,080
Bring her another meal to replace this one!

61
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,130
Here, Luffy! Bon appétit!

62
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,350
It's extremely delicious!

63
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,360
When I'm fed by you, the food tastes
sweeter than it actually is!

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,230
Oh, I'm glad!

65
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,950
...A-And that's how it'd all play out!

66
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,660
What're you doing over there in the corner?

67
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,040
Aren't you gonna eat? This
Sea King ham is good as hell!

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,120
I-I-I'm okay! You eat it!

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,380
I'm totally satisfied as I am!

70
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,690
Damn! I can't see anything.
The curtain's closed.

71
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,800
Yeah, it's totally covered! Oh,
there's an open space here!

72
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,440
Love-Love Beam!

73
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,690
Something wrong?

74
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,090
There were two bad-mannered rats
so I just taught them a lesson.

75
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,700
I see!

76
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,860
T-This is...

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,550
This must be a warning!

78
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,300
If we ever try to look into her
room, she'll do this to us!

79
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
She's scary!

80
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,770
Meanwhile, a few days ago...

81
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,830
On an island in the South Blue...

82
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,490
Luffy!

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,950
Everybody!

84
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,950
Oops!

85
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,540
Why isn't anybody here?

86
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,710
Did they kill them?

87
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,050
That can't be it! I won't believe it!

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,600
Everybody!

89
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,900
Chopper!

90
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,320
Luffy!

91
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,950
Everybody!

92
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,680
I wasn't scared at all when you guys
weren't there. I really wasn't!

93
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,260
Ow!

94
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,990
Ouch! Stop it, Luffy, Usopp!

95
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,150
I said stop, damn it!

96
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,570
Ouch! You jerk!

97
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,000
What are these birds?!

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
They're huge!

99
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,960
Are you gonna eat me?!

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,630
I-I can't move my body!

101
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,300
I gotta run!

102
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,510
Oww! Stop it!

103
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,410
Oh, my head is spinning!

104
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,940
No! Let me go!

105
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,110
You bastard!

106
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,070
What's wrong with this island!

107
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,640
Is this a dream?

108
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,290
Please tell me this is a dream!

109
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,260
No, stop it!

110
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,220
Stop it!

111
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,270
I am not your toy!

112
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,930
It's over... right?

113
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,650
What is this place?

114
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,800
Isn't there anybody here?

115
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,480
Luffy!

116
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,240
Everybody!

117
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm the only one on this island.

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,250
What am I gonna do?!

119
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,210
I'm thirsty and hungry...

120
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,170
If only Luffy and everybody else were here,

121
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,050
even on a deserted island like this,

122
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,400
we'd have a banquet!

123
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,650
Banquet, banquet!

124
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,490
Maybe I'll never see them again...

125
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,740
I can't take it!

126
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,660
Where is everybody?!

127
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,840
Luffy... Everybody...

128
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,880
Oh yeah!

129
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,620
There's this!

130
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,300
We made a promise to meet up
where this Vivre Card leads us!

131
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,260
Luffy and others will be there!

132
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,470
I know that nothing can stop them!

133
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,810
I will make it!

134
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,060
This is no time to give up!

135
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,610
I'd eat anything to survive
to see everybody again!

136
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,520
This fruit is bitter!

137
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,220
But it's juicy!

138
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,410
This one's too sour!

139
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,260
Gotcha! I need some meat, too!

140
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,700
But this doesn't look so appetizing.

141
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,870
No, I can't expect too
much on a deserted island.

142
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,420
Wow! You can't run!

143
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,180
You can't get away from me!

144
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,440
Who the hell... hit me?

145
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,070
Ouch!

146
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,780
Why is it so hot?

147
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,960
Am I gonna be dinner?!

148
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,420
Wow, it's so rare to find a raccoon!
We'll cook raccoon hot pot!

149
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,290
I rather get some birds
and do chicken hot pot.

150
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,630
We would've done it, if it were that easy.

151
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,510
We'll just have raccoon for now.

152
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,230
Stop it! I'm a reindeer!

153
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,860
Then it looks like we'll
have reindeer hot pot!

154
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,240
Oh wait, did it just say something?

155
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,160
Do reindeers speak?

156
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,090
Let me go! Just let me go!

157
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,180
I-It's a crisis! We tried to
sneak into the birds' nest

158
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,630
but they caught us!

159
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,030
The birds are coming!

160
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,530
Let's shoo them away!

161
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,680
--Let's go, everyone!
--Let's go!

162
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,720
H-Hey! Wait! Set me free before you go!

163
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,440
Looks like the birds are stronger!

164
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,690
Oh no!

165
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,330
Augh! Ow! Ow!

166
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,460
Ouch! Ouch!

167
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,220
Those birds treated me like a toy

168
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,360
and the humans tried to eat me in a hot pot!

169
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,480
What's wrong with this island?!

170
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,320
One legend suggests this
island is a treasure island.

171
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,120
This is Birdie Kingdom,
where birds reign supreme.

172
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,030
What is Chopper's fate?!

173
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,250
Behold! A dream island in the Grand Line

174
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,210
called Peachy Island.

175
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,480
"Dear Nami-san, Robin-chan,"

176
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,400
"how are you both doing?"

177
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,510
"Right now, I'm... I'm..."

178
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
- A FEW HOURS BEFORE -

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,100
W-Where am I?

180
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,640
Damn! This is all because of that Warlord!

181
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,730
Excuse me! Mister! Mister! Are you all right?

182
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,440
Mister! Mister! Are you all right?!

183
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,220
I can feel something...
and smell something sweet.

184
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,090
I'm in the hands of a beautiful woman!

185
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,670
Is it... Nami-san?!

186
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,180
No, is it Robin-chan?!

187
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,560
No, I must be dreaming.

188
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,770
But it's doesn't matter. I
just wanna be here forever!

189
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,740
Oh, w-wait a minute!

190
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
What's this?

191
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,370
You forgot your handkerchief! Oh?

192
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,770
So it wasn't a dream?

193
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,040
Elizabeth?

194
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,180
Anyway, where the hell am I?

195
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,440
Don't tell me that I'm in heaven!

196
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
Her name is Elizabeth...

197
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,840
If this is heaven,

198
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,500
is she an angel?

199
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,600
Oh, my heart aches!

200
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,390
Why is my heart beating so fast?!

201
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,580
This...

202
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,720
must be love!

203
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,470
I can see that romance is blooming!

204
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,620
Sanji-san!

205
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,280
Wait!

206
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,480
Oh no no!

207
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,070
Nami-san and Robin-chan are waiting for me!

208
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,280
No but...

209
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,170
I gotta say thank you to her!

210
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,870
I'm not the kind of guy
to forget his manners!

211
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,500
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

212
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,270
Forgive me for being unfaithful!

213
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,050
Elizabeth-chan! Oh?

214
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,320
This house has the same
design as this handkerchief.

215
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,810
Well then, maybe this is Elizabeth's...

216
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,450
Is Lady Elizabeth here?

217
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,740
My name is Sanji. You were
looking after me a while ago.

218
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,410
I came here to return your handkerchief...

219
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,630
Isn't that a bit cruel, Elizabeth-chan?!

220
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,850
No, don't rush it.

221
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,680
She's a shy, naive girl.

222
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,230
I got to be cool - have patience.

223
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,230
I'm really sorry about the
way I acted back there!

224
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,480
Your hand was so attractive
I couldn't help it!

225
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,110
Excuse me for being so forward but

226
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,370
may I make it up by cooking
something for you?

227
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,410
You can tell me whatever you want to eat!

228
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,080
I may not look it, but I'm a good chef!

229
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,110
Ah, this isn't working.

230
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,810
Do you like to cook?

231
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh yes! I love cooking!

232
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,890
Then, do you like clothes?

233
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,800
Clothes?

234
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
Yes, yes, of course!

235
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,480
Unlike some stupid swordsmen,
I care about how I look!

236
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,400
Really? You like clothes?

237
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,450
Yes!

238
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,940
Then what about dresses?

239
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,500
Dresses?

240
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,620
I got it!

241
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,950
She keeps asking what I like because she...

242
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,490
Maybe she has a thing for me!

243
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,410
How's this dress? Do you like it?

244
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,290
I like dresses! I like them! I love them!

245
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,170
I'm really fond of it!

246
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,750
How about flower prints?

247
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,130
Flower prints! They're wonderful!

248
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,360
They are really cute!

249
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,720
All right...

250
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,580
Finally, the door to
Elizabeth-chan's heart has...

251
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,660
You have a good taste, Elizabeth-chan!

252
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,250
Don't be shy! You've already
opened up the door of your heart.

253
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,250
Sanji-san!

254
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,630
Now, don't be afraid and
just come into my arms!

255
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,720
Elizabeth-chan!

256
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,970
I think...

257
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,490
...this will look good on you!

258
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,790
Oh, ow, ow, ow...

259
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,030
Despite your appearance, you're
very strong, Elizabeth-chan!

260
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,390
I-Is this a dream? Then it must be...

261
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,810
...a nightmare!

262
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,740
I thought that you were one of us!

263
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,200
You were suffering, weren't you?
You don't have to pretend anymore!

264
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,580
Yes, this is a free country!

265
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,870
Now, put this dress on and open
up the door of your heart!

266
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,540
I-I-I don't wanna open anything!

267
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,810
Wait!

268
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,270
This island is known as
the second Maiden Island.

269
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,940
Everything is pink here.

270
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,600
All people and animals
who come to this island

271
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,950
have girlish hearts.

272
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,370
This can't be heaven!

273
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,790
Hey! Wait!

274
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,790
--Aren't you one of us?!
--You are one of us!

275
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,000
Shut up! Don't come after
me! I told you I'm not!

276
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,960
"Dear Nami-san, Robin-chan,"

277
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,840
"how are you both doing?"

278
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,220
"Right now, I'm..."

279
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,600
"I'm..."

280
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,060
"I'm..."

281
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,100
"I'm..."

282
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,110
--Wait!
--Wait!

283
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,190
Why don't you wait, man?!

284
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,480
Why should I? Stupid!

285
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,030
Welcome to Kamabakka Kingdom!

286
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,310
"Right now, I'm..."

287
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,990
"...in hell!"

288
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,830
In a certain land where snow silently falls,

289
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,760
the people have been forced to
work day and night for 700 years.

290
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,970
What has Robin seen there?

291
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,470
Around the same time,

292
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,140
Usopp is about to be eaten
by mysterious plants!

293
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

294
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,230
"The Friends' Whereabouts! Bridging
the Islands and Vicious Vegetations!"

295
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
