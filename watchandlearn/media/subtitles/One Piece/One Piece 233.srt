2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,420
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,860
So how much does it look like it'll cost?

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,570
We can pay as much as you like!
We've got tons of money!

25
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,030
Her scars from battle are too deep.

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,820
Do you mean it'll take
quite a long time to fix her?

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,620
No...

28
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,950
Frankly speaking, your ship...

29
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,250
...can no longer be fixed, even with our skills.

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,630
Oh, no...

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,510
But we've been traveling
just fine up until today!

32
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,890
Let's suppose that we did
what we could anyway.

33
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,680
The probability of her
reaching the next island is...

34
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,600
...zero.

35
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,660
Merry... Can you really not...

36
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,530
...sail anymore?

37
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:15,040
"Pirate Abduction Incident and a Pirate
Ship That Can Only Await Her End"

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,510
Crap...

39
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,890
I'm sorry, Sanji. I was so
focused on books that...

40
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,680
It's nothing you should apologize about.

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,020
I just assumed that the one
who was with Robin-chan

42
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,520
was you in your human form.

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,070
Then, who on earth was that masked man?

44
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,900
In addition, it's strange that
they suddenly disappeared.

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,990
Yeah... Robin's scent disappeared there, too.

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,660
I hope nothing bad happens...
My stomach's in a knot...

47
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,790
What?

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,910
Do you want me to take a look at you?

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,250
I'm not sick!

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,250
This reminds me of what Aokiji said.

51
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,880
Did he say something worrisome?

52
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,340
He said stuff about Robin-chan's past, right?

53
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,430
And he said to us that we'd
someday regret taking her on.

54
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,600
Now that you mention it...

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,640
But does that have something to
do with Robin's disappearance?!

56
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,310
I don't know.

57
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,900
In any case, we're getting nowhere like this.
Let's go back to the Merry for now.

58
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,110
If there's no problem, she'll be back soon.

59
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,200
Yeah.

60
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,610
Take us for a spin, will ya?

61
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,560
You can't fix the Merry?! Why not?!

62
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,730
Aren't you guys amazing shipwrights?!

63
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,860
If you're worried about money, look!
We've got tons!

64
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,990
It has nothing to do with money.

65
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,660
No matter how much you pay, that ship
can't be restored to how she used to be.

66
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,790
I'm rather impressed that you guys
made it this far in the state she's in.

67
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,210
What do you mean?!
What's going on with the Merry?!

68
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,380
Do you know what a keel is, shameless girl?

69
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,260
Shamele...

70
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,510
The one at the bottom of the ship?

71
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,930
That's right. It's the most
important wood beam on a ship.

72
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,060
It crosses from stem to stern
and supports the ship.

73
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,270
When you build a ship,
you start off by placing the keel.

74
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,320
Then, the stem wood, stern wood, frame wood...

75
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,070
...frame brackets and deck beams...

76
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,580
We accurately place all those
pieces of wood around the keel.

77
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,830
That's how a ship is built.

78
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,080
The keel is the very foundation
of a ship's framework.

79
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,670
It's the essence of the ship.

80
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,130
It's not something you can just replace
if it takes on a lot of damage...

81
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,090
Replacing the keel is the same
as building a ship from scratch.

82
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,340
So no one can fix her anymore.

83
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,100
Your ship is just a collection of wood
that can only await her end.

84
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,140
Hey! Don't say it like that!

85
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,600
Not my problem. That's the truth.

86
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,320
Then... Then build a ship from scratch for us!

87
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,240
Build the Going Merry!

88
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,490
Coo coo! That's not possible, either.

89
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,280
Why not?

90
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,080
We can build a similar ship,

91
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,580
but strictly speaking,
no one can build the same ship.

92
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,290
In this world, there are no two
ships that are exactly the same.

93
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,460
What does that mean?!

94
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,420
Are there any trees in the world
that grow exactly the same way?

95
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Sailing ships are mostly made of wood,

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,310
so the size and curves of the ship are
all affected by the shape of the trees.

97
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,020
That's why an exact duplicate
of the ship can't be built,

98
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,350
even when using the same blueprint.

99
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,570
For example, even if we build such a ship,

100
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,700
without a doubt, the ones who would
feel that it's a totally different ship...

101
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,990
...would be you guys! Coo coo!

102
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,530
Oh, no...

103
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,200
Then we really can no longer
travel on the Going Merry?

104
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,420
That's right.

105
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,460
You either do nothing and wait until she sinks...

106
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,000
...or you take her apart quickly.

107
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,420
Whoa...

108
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
A caravel!

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,390
What a good ship!

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,140
Alright! All done! Now the
Going Merry pirate ship is all set!

111
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,360
Well... your ship stands on her last legs.

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,440
This is a good opportunity.

113
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,780
Just give up and buy a new ship here.

114
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,820
You've got money, right?
I heard that your ship is a caravel.

115
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,660
To start with, your future journeys will
be tough on such an old-style ship.

116
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,000
No... I don't intend to get a new ship.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,830
Luffy...

118
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,290
Our...

119
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,460
Our ship is the Going Merry!

120
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,760
If she's repaired, she can still sail!

121
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,390
It'll be fine! Today, too,
she sailed here comfortably!

122
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,560
And yet, we're suddenly told
that she can't sail anymore...?

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
How can we believe that?!

124
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,060
You guys're saying that because
you don't know how strong she is!

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,570
Will you be satisfied if you keep
sailing on her until she sinks?

126
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,240
Good grief...

127
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,410
And you call yourself a ship's captain?!

128
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,330
Our discussion is over for now.

129
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,540
Think about it carefully. If you decide
to buy a ship, come again. I'll help you.

130
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,210
If you give us your 300 million, we can
even build a state-of-the-art ship for you.

131
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,300
Kalifa!

132
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,760
Yes. Please give it a thought.

133
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,930
This is a catalogue that contains
both new and used models.

134
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,720
Please use it as a price reference.

135
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,020
Iceberg-san!

136
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,980
There's someone at the gate
who wants to see you.

137
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,770
Hm?

138
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,190
I don't see any appointment, though.

139
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,690
Looks like that World Government
Official is here again.

140
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,900
Shall I turn him away?

141
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,780
Well... yeah... Tell him I'm out.

142
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,580
Anyway, you've got quite
a case of bed head, Lulu.

143
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,620
Oops. Pardon me.

144
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,290
Well then, I'll ask him to leave.

145
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,920
Y-Yeah, would you?

146
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,550
Hold it, Iceberg-kun.

147
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,970
So you're around.

148
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,050
Hey, you guys, hide! It's a government official!

149
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,760
What? O-Okay.

150
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,980
Well... Hi, Corgy. I'm not around today.

151
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,320
Yes, you are!

152
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,110
Seriously, I've come all
the way here by sea train.

153
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,450
Please don't refuse me.

154
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,120
Hm?

155
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,920
I somehow detect the scent of pirates.

156
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,500
Well, that's okay. In any case,
I want to talk to you.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,470
I hate you! Go home!

158
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,340
Are you a child?

159
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,300
I'm a fully grown man.

160
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,140
Well, please don't be so obstinate.

161
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,060
I brought a good deal for you today.
Give me a chance to explain.

162
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,520
Now, let's go somewhere inconspicuous.

163
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,280
They keep coming back. How persistent...

164
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,370
What business do they have with Iceberg-san?

165
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,620
It has nothing to do with us. It must be
something to do with power. Coo coo.

166
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,120
Shall I go beat them up?

167
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,040
Don't. They're from the World Government.

168
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,670
Hm...? What? What's the matter?

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,640
This is something I noticed when I
carried these bags and hid earlier...

170
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,390
They are light, after all.

171
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,720
What...? Why?

172
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,110
Oh, don't joke like that. Why would they
be light with all that money in them?

173
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,950
What are those voices?!

174
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,370
You idiots! What's the big fuss?!

175
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,750
Hey, woman! If you sit like that...!

176
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't tell me... There's...

177
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,920
...no way...

178
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Our 200 million Berries...!

179
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,890
It's gone! It's really gone!

180
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,060
On closer inspection, they're not our bags!

181
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,430
Wh-Wh-Wh-What're we gonna do?!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...

182
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,900
Hey, what are you guys shouting so loud for?

183
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,690
Our money is... gone.

184
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,570
It's... totally... gone.

185
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,610
--What?!
--Paulie! Did you...

186
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,740
It's not me!

187
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,240
--Are you telling the truth?!
--Why would I lie?!

188
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,950
--Is that really true?!
--How noisy... More importantly, Kaku.

189
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,000
Weren't you with the Franky Family earlier?

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,960
Hm? What're you talking about?

191
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,590
I haven't seen the Franky Family today.

192
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,050
That's strange. I'm sure I saw your long nose.

193
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,550
Hold on a sec, you guys!

194
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,640
That's Usopp!

195
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,510
He was with the Franky Family?!

196
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,100
He was with them, or rather,
he was carried away by them.

197
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,640
That's an abduction!

198
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,480
Luffy! We'll go look for him right away!

199
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,810
Okay!

200
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,230
Hey! Hold on a sec!
Where're you gonna look, Luffy?!

201
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,660
Just wait, Usopp! Money!

202
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,700
Geez...

203
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,040
Hey, where's the Franky Family's hideout?

204
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,710
It's more like a workshop rather than a hideout,

205
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,380
but it's at the seashore quite a ways
northwest from the rocky cape

206
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,170
where your ship is anchored.

207
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,720
It's called Franky House.

208
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,070
Luffy!

209
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,990
Luffy!

210
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,540
Seriously, when there's no way he
could find Usopp all by himself...!

211
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,540
I have no time to look for Luffy.

212
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,130
I'd better go leave this
money at the ship for now.

213
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,750
If I march in saying, "Give me our 200
million back" with 100 million on me,

214
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,050
I'd be asking them to steal it too.

215
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,760
Anyway, Yagara-chan, head towards
the bull shop using the shortest route!

216
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,940
I'm gonna take Zoro and the others
with me and teach them a lesson!

217
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,690
Franky Family! Stealing from pirates?!
You're the lowest!

218
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,370
This is the first floor,
the backstreet shopping district.

219
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,410
Take care and have a good day!

220
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm counting on you, Yagara-chan!

221
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,510
What the heck?!

222
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,130
Hey, watch out, lady!

223
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,010
Sorry!

224
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,310
I hope... Usopp got away okay.

225
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,860
This is terrible.

226
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,240
Who the heck is he?

227
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,990
Hey! Does anyone know who this guy is?!

228
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,370
A crowd of people...

229
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,040
Yagara-chan! Stop! Stop!

230
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,500
Usopp!

231
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Usopp! Wake up!

232
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,550
Hey...! Are you okay?!

233
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,300
Hey!

234
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,390
Hey! Usopp! Usopp!

235
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,190
Hey, are you guys pirates by any chance?

236
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,020
Shut up! Don't stare at us!

237
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,570
Usopp! Was it the Franky Family
who did this to you? Was it them?!

238
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:37,120
Yeah... Because I'm weak...

239
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,580
That large amount of money...

240
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,500
They stole it all.

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,670
Nami...

242
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,380
Yeah...?

243
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,170
I can't face everyone.

244
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,060
We were finally about to have Merry repaired...

245
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,190
I feel so ashamed.

246
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,740
Dammit...!

247
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,490
Usopp, I get it.

248
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,700
Don't worry about the money.
We'll all go and get it back for sure.

249
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,460
He's hurt quite badly.
I probably shouldn't move him.

250
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,880
Usopp, stay here just for a while.

251
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,920
I'll hurry back to the ship and bring back help.

252
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,220
I'll bring Chopper, too, so that he can treat you!

253
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,010
Don't worry about the stolen money.

254
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,640
I heard that their hideout is ahead of here.

255
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,970
So we'll crush them and
that'll be the end of them!

256
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,940
Hey! This isn't a show!

257
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,900
Listen, Usopp. Just stay put here, okay?

258
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,690
I'll be back right away!

259
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,040
Go faster, Yagara-chan!

260
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,500
Ahhh! A runaway bull!

261
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,960
Hey!

262
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,670
We were finally about to have Merry repaired...

263
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,100
No matter how much you pay, that ship
can't be restored to how she used to be.

264
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,850
Whether we decide to buy a new ship

265
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:27,770
or have someone else manage
to fix and improve the Merry,

266
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,530
unless we spend all the 300 million
on the ship to upgrade her,

267
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,610
our future journey will certainly be hard.

268
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,620
We definitely need that money.

269
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,080
We have to get it back without fail!

270
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,660
Is that true?!

271
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,620
At least that's what that shipwright said.

272
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,920
This ship...

273
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,090
...can no longer be fixed?
Even if we pay lots of money?!

274
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,800
Then... What's gonna happen to Merry?!

275
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,470
Beats me.

276
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,550
In the end, it depends on how
Luffy and the others decide

277
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,180
after hearing the outcome of the assessment.

278
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,100
Those three at the shipyard will
probably make some decision.

279
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,560
But it's too extreme.

280
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,770
Look at the ship!

281
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,650
She's the same old Merry.

282
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,990
We and Merry traveled together
all the way here from the East Blue!

283
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,080
That's exactly why, right?

284
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,620
Human beings can become
stronger after each hardship,

285
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,370
but ships are different.

286
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,790
Their pain only accumulates.

287
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,130
It's hard to swallow.

288
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,720
Besides, what's Usopp
gonna say when he hears it?

289
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,100
I love the Merry!

290
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,850
We all do. But her scars are so deep
that there's nothing we can do, he said.

291
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,770
The Merry... Robin-chan...
I'm worried about both.

292
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,520
What a restless afternoon...

293
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,280
Guys!

294
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,700
Oh? Nami's back!

295
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,660
Hm? Looks like she's alone.

296
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,370
What happened to Luffy and Usopp?

297
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,000
Nami-san! Did something happen?!

298
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,180
Yow! Yow, yow! 200 million?!

299
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,970
Yes, 200 million!

300
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,890
What do you think, Bro?!

301
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,270
Incredible! You guys are amazing!

302
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:34,060
We've always wanted that. With this
much money, we can finally get it!

303
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,070
We did it, didn't we, Bro?

304
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,690
Three years of persevering...
We've always said, "If only we could get it..."

305
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,360
--It was such a long time.
--Yeah...

306
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,990
Each time we got a chunk of money,
we'd pin our hopes on Yagara races...

307
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,290
...and lose all the money!

308
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,160
Each time we captured a criminal
with a bounty, we'd party it up...

309
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,500
...and lose all the money!

310
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,590
We couldn't quite save up the
200-million-Berry business expense!

311
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,510
But we finally have it now!

312
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,640
Oh, yeah. Good job, you guys!

313
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,890
Well then, this isn't much,
but here is five million Berries.

314
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,520
This is to show my appreciation.
Eat and drink as you please!

315
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,440
That's our Bro!

316
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,110
It's party time!

317
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,530
Wh-What the hell?!

318
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,040
Hm?

319
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,080
Dammit!

320
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,250
Who's trying to defy the Franky Family?!

321
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,180
Huh?! You're that weak guy from earlier!

322
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,930
What? You could still stand?

323
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,390
Give me the money back!

324
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:00,400
"Give me the money back"? Then are
you one of the Straw Hat's underlings?

325
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,950
That's right, Bro! Since he's with
Straw Hat Luffy, I expected him to be

326
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,490
a really strong pirate, but then...

327
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,660
He's so weak!

328
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,580
That's none of your business!

329
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,130
Oops!

330
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,380
What's he doing?!

331
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,430
I'll admit you've got guts to come
to get the money back all by yourself,

332
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,010
but I can't let you have it back.

333
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,640
Give it back to me!

334
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:42,230
We have to... have our ship repaired...

335
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,410
That money is crucial to us!

336
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,870
With that money...

337
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,670
...we can finally repair the Merry's scars!

338
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,010
I can't let you jerks have it!

339
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,070
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

340
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,610
Chasing after something constant

341
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,200
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

342
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,490
Even when we're exhausted

343
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,660
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

344
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,090
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

345
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,010
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

346
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

347
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,760
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

348
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,850
Eternally... Eternally...

349
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,640
Wild fantasies from our childhood

350
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,480
We trace unforgettable memories

351
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,150
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

352
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,990
To this familiar sunny sky

353
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,780
Together we entrust our feelings

354
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,370
We go beyond the changing time

355
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,000
Eternally... Eternally...

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,130
Give me back...

357
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,380
Usopp!

358
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,630
Give me that money back!

359
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,590
Chopper?!

360
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,510
He's hurt very badly, but he'll be okay.
I can somehow manage to save him!

361
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,430
Okay. Just wait a bit, Usopp.

362
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,770
We're gonna go blow that stupid house away!

363
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

364
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,650
"Rescuing Our Friend!
Raid on the Franky House"

365
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
