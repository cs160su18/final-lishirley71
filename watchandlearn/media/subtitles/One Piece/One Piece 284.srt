00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,970
My treasure?

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,820
If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,960
Find it!

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,380
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,680
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,650
and set out in search
of something to find

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,440
ONE PIECE!

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,370
Compasses only cause delays

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,860
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,760
If the dusty treasure map

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,810
has been verified,

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,200
it's not a legend!

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,260
When it comes to personal storms,

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn't there!

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,540
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,490
We are, We are on the cruise!

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,800
We are!

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,080
Wealth, fame, power...

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,750
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

33
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,200
My treasure?

34
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,380
If you want it, you can have it!

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,720
Find it!

36
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,830
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

39
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,270
Twenty years ago,
everything was taken away from me

40
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,940
and many people's lives
were ruined.

41
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,450
It was caused by a single attack--

42
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,070
Buster Call.

43
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,360
That attack is now...

44
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,860
...targeted on the friends I was finally
able to find, whom I can be myself with.

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,340
The more I wish to be with you,

46
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,620
the more my fate
will show its fangs to you!

47
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,010
No matter how far I go on the sea,

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,540
I have a huge enemy
that I can't shake off...

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,880
...because the world and
its darkness are my enemy!

50
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,220
The incident with Aokiji,
as well as this time...

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,890
I've already dragged you
into my troubles twice!

52
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,850
If this continues forever, even though
you guys're good-natured...

53
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,120
...you'll eventually feel
that I'm a burden!

54
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm sure you'll betray me
one day and abandon me!

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,470
That's what I'm most afraid of!

56
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,460
That's why I didn't want
you to come to rescue me!

57
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,530
If I'm going to die someday anyway,

58
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,600
I want to die
right here, right now!

59
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,580
I see!

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,470
That indeed is a sound argument!

61
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,980
That's true.

62
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,100
No one is stupid enough
to think that having you isn't a burden.

63
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,780
Look at that symbol,
you damn pirates!

64
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,450
That logo indicates the unity
of over 170 member countries

65
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,580
spanning the four seas
and the Grand Line!

66
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,360
This is the world!

67
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,320
Do you now realize how completely
powerless you guys are to fight against it?!

68
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,940
Do you realize how huge
of an organization

69
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,500
this woman has been pursued by?!

70
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,210
I now understand well the
identity of Robin's enemy.

71
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,940
Sogeking.

72
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,970
Shoot through that flag.

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,550
Roger.

74
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,790
This is my new weapon,
a huge slingshot...

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,810
named Kabuto!

76
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,360
Have a good look at its power!

77
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,190
Special Attack... Firebird Star!

78
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,910
Oh, no...!

79
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,480
Mission accomplished.

80
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,250
Th-They've gone and done it!

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,210
Do they understand what it
means to attack the flag?!

82
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,180
The pirates declared war
against the World Government!

83
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,450
Are you insane?!

84
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,120
Don't think that
you'll be able to survive

85
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,890
after making the entire
world your enemy!

86
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,770
Bring it on!

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,770
Robin!

88
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,990
We still haven't heard you say it!

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,120
Say you want to live!

90
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
Robin...

91
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,310
Robin!

92
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,890
To live...

93
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,430
I thought it was something
I dared not wish for.

94
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,950
No one ever let me wish for it.

95
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,320
The sea is vast,

96
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,150
so someday, definitely...

97
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,780
...you'll come across friends
who'll protect you!

98
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,080
Believe in Luffy.

99
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,250
If...

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,210
it's really okay for me
to utter my wish for once...

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,180
I...

102
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,360
I want to live!

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,560
Take me to the sea with you!

104
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:23,790
You guys...!
I love you guys, dammit!

105
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,530
Let's go!

106
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,610
"I'm Not Gonna Hand over
the Blueprints! Franky's Decision"

107
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,320
Okay! We pulled the lever!

108
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,430
All right!

109
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,130
Looks like Mozu and the
others did okay, too.

110
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,950
Go, Straw Hat!

111
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,330
The drawbridge is coming down!

112
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,500
Looks like they pulled through.

113
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,460
Good timing.

114
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,260
I-I'm trembling with anticipation!

115
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,120
Lower that bridge already.

116
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,720
He looks evil.

117
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,060
Robin!

118
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,020
We're gonna rescue you for sure!

119
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,480
Stay there!

120
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,390
They're in high spirits.

121
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,790
To think that they don't fear
the flag of the Government...

122
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,240
How pointless.

123
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,880
There's no way
that they could defeat us.

124
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,450
Stay there!

125
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,090
The drawbridge is coming down!

126
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,460
Go! Straw Hat!

127
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,340
How dare those damn pirates?!

128
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,740
We're not gonna let it happen!

129
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,110
Get the trench mortar ready!

130
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,150
Stop the drawbridge!
Break it if you have to!

131
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,180
Yes, sir!

132
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm not gonna let you do that!

133
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,600
Pipe Hitch Knives!

134
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,030
This is the end of you!

135
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,170
Demolition Chop!

136
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,340
Chief Justice Baskerville!

137
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,250
Too bad!

138
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,890
We're actually
the Chief Justice trio!

139
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,600
What?!

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,060
I, the Left Baskerville,
am named Bas!

141
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,520
I, the Right Baskerville,
am named Kerville!

142
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,780
And I, the Center Baskerville,
go by the name...

143
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,110
...Princess!

144
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,490
What the heck?!

145
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,800
So those three were just
sticking together? That's all?

146
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,450
What for?!

147
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,410
We're good friends!

148
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,100
Shut up!

149
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,880
Fire the trench mortar!

150
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,260
The drawbridge
stopped coming down?!

151
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,030
How dare they get in our way?!

152
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,230
Damn bastards!

153
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,860
Who's doing this?!

154
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,130
Chief Spandam!

155
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,900
Please evacuate
from the Tower of Law!

156
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,510
All right! Good job!

157
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,290
I'm gonna head to the Gates of Justice
before they come over to this side!

158
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,580
Come, Nico Robin!

159
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,960
Someone! Bring Cutty Flam!

160
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,340
Robin!

161
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,090
Those pirates are just nobodies.

162
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,300
I've got the assassin group
CP9 on my side!

163
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,150
Nico Robin, a survivor
of the island of scholars

164
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,490
who schemed to bring back
the weapon...

165
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,780
Cutty Flam, who inherited
the weapon's blueprints...

166
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,980
I'm definitely not gonna stand back and
miss this opportunity to gain big power!

167
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,340
Cutty Flam...

168
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,140
That's...

169
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,020
Hey... don't tell me...

170
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,560
...those are the ancient
weapon Pluton's blueprints...!

171
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,530
They're the real deal.

172
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,190
Do you believe me?

173
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,110
Lucci... Kaku...
You guys can tell, right?

174
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,210
I thought it was unlikely...

175
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,240
So you were hiding them
inside your body, huh?

176
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,780
T-The real ones?!

177
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,680
Are those the real ones?!

178
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,110
Hand them over...
Hand them over to me!

179
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,600
Those are my long-sought
blueprints!

180
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,270
Nico Robin.

181
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,700
Rumors are such unreliable things,
aren't they?

182
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,000
While we were being
brought to this damn place,

183
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,870
I came to realize
that you aren't the evil

184
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,210
who's trying to misuse the weapon.

185
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,880
How to build the weapon isn't
what the Water Seven's shipwrights

186
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,640
have been inheriting for
generations in the first place.

187
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,420
Tom-san achieved
so many great things,

188
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,760
and he gave up everything in order to
preserve these blueprints for the future.

189
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,570
At least, as long as there's a risk

190
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,430
that a woman named Nico Robin
can restore the weapon,

191
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,310
the world needs
those blueprints to fight back.

192
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,270
Hey, Spanda.

193
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,460
What Tom-san and Iceberg
risked their lives to protect is...

194
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,740
Hand them over to me already!

195
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,750
...the wish of this
weapon's architect--

196
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,790
that is, if the ancient weapon fell
into the hands of an idiot like you

197
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,430
and started being used
to cause trouble,

198
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,750
he would want another weapon
to be built in order to stop it.

199
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,000
It's true that if you use Nico Robin,
you can revive the ancient weapon.

200
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,190
Even if she doesn't
want to help you,

201
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,670
as long as there's a chance
that she could be used,

202
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,440
she's still dangerous.

203
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,370
But she's got friends

204
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,900
who would be willing to risk
their lives to protect her.

205
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,480
So I'll...

206
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,380
...take a chance.

207
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,000
I can think

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,910
of only one way that I could
uphold the architect's wish in this situation.

209
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,710
Just shut up and hand them
over to me already!

210
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,120
Those are mine!

211
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,930
Tom-san...!

212
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,540
In this situation,
I'm sure you'd also...

213
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,610
I can think

214
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,450
of only one way that I could
uphold the architect's wish in this situation.

215
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,340
Just shut up and hand them
over to me already!

216
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,700
Those are mine!

217
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,660
Tom-san...!

218
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,800
In this situation,
I'm sure you'd also...

219
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,400
You bastard!
What're you doing?!

220
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,430
It's burned black!

221
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,890
Dammit!

222
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,360
I'm gonna kill you!

223
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,900
Our five-year mission...

224
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,300
The blueprints were kept in order
to create a weapon to fight back...

225
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,890
And you, the Government,
came after them a second time.

226
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,940
Essentially, something like
this should remain a secret,

227
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,060
and so once it's revealed,
it has to be eliminated.

228
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,430
Now, there's no longer power to
fight back against the ancient weapon.

229
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,550
If nothing is done and Nico Robin
falls into your hands,

230
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,020
it'll be hopeless.

231
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,710
But if the Straw Hats win...

232
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,160
...there won't be anything
left to you at all.

233
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,450
I made a bet on their victory.

234
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,850
How dare you mock me...?

235
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,760
Seems like you want
to die here, too, huh?

236
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,960
Bro!

237
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,300
Bro!

238
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,840
Big Bro Franky!

239
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,860
Hey look!

240
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,280
Bro is at the Tower of Law!

241
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,150
Good! He's fine!

242
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,810
That's Bro!

243
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,210
Bro!

244
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,310
We came to rescue you!

245
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,790
We came with the Straw Hats!

246
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,590
Sodom and Gomorrah
fought hard, too!

247
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,790
Bro!

248
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,670
Let's go back together!

249
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,410
Are you hurt?!

250
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,970
Y... You guys...

251
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
You idiots...

252
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,840
Who asked you to come...

253
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,880
To come rescue me?!

254
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,640
You idiots!

255
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,880
Bastards! I'm not crying!

256
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,770
Shut up, you bastards!

257
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,730
What are you, a demon?!

258
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,370
Robin's waiting!

259
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,190
Hurry up
and bring down the bridge!

260
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,910
Oh, yeah, right.

261
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,880
Hurry up, you bastards!

262
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,700
That's right!

263
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,840
Hurry up, you guys!
Or I'm gonna beat you up!

264
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,780
Y-Yeah, you're right.

265
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,410
I like you when you're contradictory
like that, too, Nami-san!

266
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,420
Hey, Straw Hat!

267
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,270
Looks like you helped
my underlings.

268
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,720
But this time,

269
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,810
I, their boss, the great Franky,

270
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,720
will add my super fighting power
to you guys!

271
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,550
Whatever!

272
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,690
I'm still holding what
you did to Usopp against you!

273
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,960
Err... well,
he's right next to you...

274
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,990
Cutty Flam...

275
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,080
How dare you...

276
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,820
...burn my blueprints?!

277
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,630
Ahhh! Bro!

278
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,590
Bro is falling into the falls!

279
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,730
Franky!

280
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,300
Hey, pirates!

281
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,070
What?! Kokoro-san?!

282
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,750
I heard everything!

283
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,610
What're you guys wasting time for?!

284
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,910
Wasting time?

285
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,770
But the
bridge is only halfway down.

286
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,920
Halfway is good enough!

287
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,230
We'll be there in four seconds.

288
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,210
What the hell is that?!

289
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,700
Jump with all your might
towards the falls!

290
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,660
That's... from earlier...!

291
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,530
Is that Granny?

292
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,760
What does she mean?

293
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,930
I don't know.

294
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,620
But she said
jump towards the falls.

295
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,270
A-A sea train?!

296
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,550
Why is it coming into the courthouse?!

297
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,610
Chimney, sound the
whistle with gusto.

298
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,930
Okay!

299
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,940
The sound of the sea train?

300
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,860
What's the meaning of that smile?

301
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,450
Chief Justice!

302
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,120
Please get out of here!

303
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,570
Stop!

304
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,090
Here we go!

305
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,420
I knew it!

306
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,300
Nooo!

307
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,490
Rocketman can still run!

308
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,960
Don't underestimate Tom's Workers,

309
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,980
a legendary ship-building company!

310
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,360
R-Rocketman?!

311
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,240
It's flying again!

312
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,900
What?!

313
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,010
They're coming!

314
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,480
It's a waterfall!

315
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,180
This brings back memories,
doesn't it, Tom-san?

316
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,030
About assisting that Roger guy...

317
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,700
I'm resolutely proud of it!

318
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,070
I'm Luffy.

319
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,720
I'm the man
who'll be King of the Pirates.

320
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,350
Really?!

321
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,790
Yeah.

322
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,190
Roger

323
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,050
was an idiot like him,
too, wasn't he?

324
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,100
And you helped him out.

325
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,180
Seems like we didn't learn our lesson.

326
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,700
Everyone in Tom's Workers
is helping this pirate kid.

327
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,150
You would've done the same,
wouldn't you, Tom-san?

328
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,530
We're gonna collide!

329
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,490
W-We're gonna crash!

330
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,130
As it stands,
Robin will be in danger.

331
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,550
We have to do something before
they go through the Gates of Justice.

332
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,390
So that means we have to defeat
CP9 and get those five keys, huh?

333
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,770
In any case, we don't
have much time.

334
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,480
Everyone! Take them down
even if it costs you your life!

335
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,790
Just wait, Robin!

336
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,620
On the next episode of One Piece!

337
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,150
"Obtain the Five Keys!
The Straw Hat Pirates vs. CP9"

338
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,830
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
