Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

WE GO!

68
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,060
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

69
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,400
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

70
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,070
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago to
go on to the next stage - the New World.

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,530
Why are they calling you Straw Hat?

72
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,870
Hey, you! Don't you know who I am?

73
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,460
Get out of my way or I'll kill
you and pull out your bowels!

74
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,630
Straw Hat is not scum like you!

75
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,010
What?!

76
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,140
I see. They all got fooled
and became his crew.

77
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,970
And I don't know why but the
real Straw Hat is here too.

78
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,480
That was close!

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,860
H-Here's his poster...

80
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,780
Looks exactly the same!

81
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,280
Second Gear!

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,330
Gum-Gum...

83
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,960
...Jet Pistol!

84
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,760
Straw Hat... He is using Haki!

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,260
Luffy! I knew it was you!

86
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,140
Why are you always in trouble?!

87
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,100
It's really been a long time!
I wonder how everybody is!

88
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm so happy!

89
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,980
I came here to check but you seem alright.

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,820
Uh-huh!

91
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,070
Rayleigh!

92
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,530
I'll do it!

93
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,130
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

94
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,490
"Everyone Together! Luffy,
Setting Out for the New World!"

95
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,240
It seems like things are
getting hectic over there...

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,220
What are you guys doing?!

97
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,930
Get Straw Hat already!

98
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,070
--Oops!
--Hurry up, Luffy!

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,520
Rayleigh, thank you for everything!

100
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,520
Well then, Rayleigh...

101
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,110
Thanks again for everything!

102
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,220
I'm going now!

103
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,200
Yes...

104
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,400
They went that way!

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,300
--Go after them!
--Don't let them get away!

106
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,760
Rise to the top!

107
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,860
The Straw Hats are heading for Grove #42!

108
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,240
Catch them at any cost!

109
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,240
What was that?

110
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,320
Dark King Rayleigh!

111
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,860
It's a new beginning for my pupil!

112
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,790
Don't be too hard on him.

113
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,880
Wh-What is this line?

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,340
I recommend you not to cross it.

115
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,500
Oh, Bon Bags! A lot of them!

116
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,700
What's in them?

117
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,750
They're all filled with food.

118
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,770
I know everybody's stomach got
bigger these past 2 years.

119
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,210
I'll let you fill up later!

120
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,940
Really?! Can't wait to eat your food!

121
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,860
There they are! They're this way!

122
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,330
Oh? They went round!

123
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
We have no choice!

124
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,210
Everybody, charge!

125
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,460
Yeah!

126
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,090
I wanna become a flea...

127
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,630
What's wrong? What're you...?

128
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,470
I wanna become a mite...

129
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,820
What?!

130
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,760
What happened?!

131
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
I... I...

132
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,230
I wanna become a louse...

133
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,820
It must be...

134
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,860
I knew it was you guys causing all of this!

135
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,240
I can't believe it!

136
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,660
You haven't gotten anywhere yet!

137
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,330
Oh! I know you from Thriller Bark!

138
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,830
Who was she?

139
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,470
What are you still doing here?

140
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,270
You can't talk to me like
that! I brought you back here!

141
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,590
If it weren't for me, you would be...

142
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,710
You must learn your place...

143
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,090
Sniff, sniff...

144
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,980
A real woman! A real woman!

145
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,440
Of course I am! What kind
of sickness do you have?

146
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,190
Anyway, set sail already!

147
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,070
I saw some Navy ships around here!

148
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,940
What?!

149
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,990
Soon, there'll be no way out!

150
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,200
That's no good. But it's strange.

151
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,700
I can't move from here.

152
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,110
What are you talking about?!

153
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,960
Real ladies are great!

154
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,520
I am scum...

155
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,300
What's that?

156
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,630
There you are!

157
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,350
THE SHORE AT GROVE #42 THE
RENDEZVOUS POINT OF THE STRAW HATS

158
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,600
--Oh!
--That must be...!

159
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,280
Usopp-san! Nami-san! Robin-san!

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,950
Hey! I can't believe you abandoned stardom!

163
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,120
Attaboy!

164
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,920
It's been a long time, everybody!

165
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,720
You two have become even more beautiful!

166
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,800
Alright, Nami-san!

167
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,760
It's been 2 years so...

168
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,340
Oh, are you gonna sing for us?

169
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,900
...Could I look at your panties...

170
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,150
What do you think?!

171
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,780
I never let you see them even 2 years ago!

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,070
I-I'm so excited to see you again... See?

173
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,840
It's shaking my soul...

174
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,690
--Although I don't have a soul to be shaken...
--Hey, the big star is having a spasm.

175
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,210
Honestly! None of you guys have grown up.

176
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,490
By the way, I don't see everybody here yet.

177
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,510
--Oh yeah, Chopper went to pick them up.
--Hey!

178
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,350
Here they come finally!

179
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,340
Wow, hey!

180
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,660
Everybody!

181
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,820
I brought them!

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,330
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

183
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,440
Hey!

184
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,340
Luffy-san! I missed you so much!

185
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,420
You guys sure do look stronger!

186
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,550
We all got together again!

187
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,100
Finally...

188
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,630
Guys!

189
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,050
What?!

190
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,110
Sanji!

191
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,400
Well then, thank you!

192
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,710
Say "hi" to everybody in
Birdie Kingdom for me!

193
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,710
Usopp! Is Sanji alright?!

194
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,880
O-O-One beautiful woman...

195
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,390
--Hey, stay with me!
--Two beautiful woman...

196
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,480
Hey, this is no good,
Chopper! Stop the bleeding!

197
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,850
F-F-Franky, you're...!

198
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,250
What's the matter?

199
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,680
Is there something that concerns you-mecha?

200
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,110
--Mecha?! I wanna play!
--Wait, Luffy!

201
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,030
I don't know what's so
great and besides that,

202
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,740
it looks like the Navy
ships are already here!

203
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,190
Oh no! When did they get here?!

204
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,790
There are 3 Navy ships!

205
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,170
Hey, should we fight back?!
They're gonna get us!

206
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,130
Shoot! Shoot and sink them!

207
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,850
Oh no! It's gonna hit us!

208
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,770
Slave...

209
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,680
...Arrow!

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,920
Wh-What just happened?

211
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,400
I-It's...

212
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,270
...The Kuja Pirates!

213
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,070
Who...

214
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,150
...put a Navy ship...

215
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,160
...in my way?

216
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,490
That's Kuja's logo!

217
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,610
Kuja?

218
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,390
They're strong amazonian pirates led
by a pirate empress - a Warlord.

219
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,330
A Warlord?!

220
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,330
Her name is Boa Hancock.

221
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,300
They say anyone who sees her
will be attracted by her beauty

222
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,140
and turned to stone in the end.

223
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,970
Oh, too bright! She is dazzling!

224
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,810
There is no end to her beauty!

225
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,510
Wow! She must be a goddess!

226
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,010
Goddess?!

227
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,730
Where is she?! Goddess? Goddess?

228
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,760
Goddess... Oh, goddess... Goddess... Godd...

229
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,520
--G...
--He turned to stone!

230
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,200
Oh, that's Hancock and the others!

231
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,010
Move your ship, Boa Hancock!

232
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,870
Are you trying to interfere
with us fulfilling our duty?

233
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,060
No, I'm not!

234
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,120
I just don't feel like making way for you.

235
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,330
Sh-She's acting like a child!

236
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,920
Is that a problem?

237
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,210
Go, Luffy... Now is the chance!

238
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,600
She just winked at us...

239
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,380
She helped us. Let's set sail now!

240
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,060
You know that Warlord?

241
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah, I was sent to the Maiden Island
and I became friends with them.

242
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,920
That's the legendary
female-only island, right?

243
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,230
I didn't know they were real...

244
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,650
Friend with the pirate empress?!

245
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,980
Hey, were you really training hard?!

246
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,200
Yeah, I'm so ready!

247
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,020
Damn... It's not fair...! It's not fair...!

248
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,620
What's the matter, Sanji?

249
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,540
Whoa, so they're Luffy's friends!

250
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,880
There are a bunch of creatures
that I've never seen before.

251
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,590
--1, 2, 3, 4...
--Looks like they're having fun!

252
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Okay, let's get ready to set sail now!

253
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,260
--Yeah!
--Yes, Nami-san!

254
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,630
What's the matter, Usopp?

255
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,470
I was just thinking... did you
guys beat all those Navy soldiers?

256
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,860
No, we heard them shouting
while we were flying.

257
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,870
Then, why aren't they coming
after us from inland?

258
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,950
This is Backup Unit Platoon 3!

259
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,110
Can you hear me?

260
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,750
--What's wrong? What happened?
--We can't get to Grove #42!

261
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,210
--Why is that?
--B-Because...

262
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,710
...there are huge bugs standing in our way...

263
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,140
What? Bugs?!

264
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,730
What are they?!

265
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,700
Shoot!

266
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,260
I won't let them mess with
Usopp'n's new adventure'n!

267
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,580
When men part ways, we don't shed tears'n.

268
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,000
Good luck, Usopp'n!

269
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,670
As long as they're not coming, that's good.

270
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,020
If they're in trouble, we're lucky.

271
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,110
Let's just leave now!

272
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,920
Nami, lead the way!

273
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,680
You can count on me!

274
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,370
Alright!

275
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,190
This is Platoon 4.

276
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,660
I'm sorry. All of the sudden,
it started raining and the

277
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,220
gunpowder got wet!

278
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,690
Rain? Where?

279
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,020
Sabaody Archipelago should
be clear and sunny today!

280
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,300
No thunder. We don't want
normal people to get hurt.

281
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,450
The bubbles are a pain in the neck here.

282
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,920
But I can't believe we
caught such perfect wind.

283
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,720
It brought us here just as we wanted.

284
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,800
That's because Nami-chan is a good girl.

285
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,840
Good luck! We will miss you on Weatheria!

286
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,870
Oh, it's inflating!

287
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,670
What? This jelly inflates?

288
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,220
Oh, we got a bubble roof!

289
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,840
Listen, guys.

290
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,840
A coated ship has the ability
to reduce any kind of pressure.

291
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,360
So once the floating bag at the ship's
bottom which keeps it on the surface

292
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,810
has been removed,

293
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,660
it'll be less buoyant and start to sink.

294
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,780
That's how it works.

295
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,360
I see.

296
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,830
Too complicated, huh?

297
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,830
Anyway, spread the sail now!

298
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,840
Sail?

299
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,350
A coated sailing ship

300
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,000
is driven by the sea current
instead of the wind.

301
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,000
I thought it just submerged and travelled.

302
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,480
Alright, we better hurry
before the Navy comes again!

303
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,210
This is Central Unit Platoon 5 at Grove #42!

304
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,870
This is an emergency situation!

305
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,810
All the troops in Platoon 2 that
came before have become negative...

306
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,820
What are you saying? Negative?!

307
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,190
I wanna become like moss...

308
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,020
I'm no good. I wanna become a water flea...

309
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,030
According to them, Straw Hat Luffy got on a

310
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,770
giant bird and flew away!

311
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,280
Bird? What are you guys doing now?!

312
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,240
We're fighting against unknown enemies!

313
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,250
Damn, that bastard!

314
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,360
He gave me trouble to the last minute!

315
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,750
I've got to find a new boy-toy...

316
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,130
Navy reinforcements! We
were about to leave...

317
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,590
Everybody!

318
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,580
Straw Hat's ship is in range now!

319
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,770
Wait a minute! A giant
bird is coming towards us!

320
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,150
He...

321
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,110
They're coming from behind too!

322
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,530
I got it!

323
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,370
How do you like it, Nami-san?

324
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,450
Did you see me getting stronger?

325
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,340
Sanji!

326
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,800
Answer, Platoon 5! What's going on?!

327
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,880
W-We are...

328
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,070
We're facing an unexpected obstacle...

329
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,060
Don't do it!

330
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,520
How could you turn us down?!

331
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,940
Maybe they're all shy.

332
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,780
You don't have to be ashamed!

333
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,360
Let's have a cup of tea together!

334
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,080
I-I-I'm gonna go out of my mind!

335
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,840
Oh! You've got such a cute face!

336
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,580
No, don't do it!

337
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,170
What's wrong? Answer, Platoon 5!

338
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,390
Sanji-kun, now is the chance!

339
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,080
Hey, hey, what's wrong, Sanji?!

340
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,340
I-I-I don't know... Suddenly,

341
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,450
it felt like someone was
squeezing my heart...

342
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,110
The floating bag is removed!

343
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,320
Okay! What about sail?

344
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,610
We're ready!

345
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,680
Is it time to go, Nami?

346
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,660
Yes, at your command, Captain.

347
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,670
Alright...

348
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,100
You guys!

349
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,350
I've got a lot of things that I want
to share with you but in any case,

350
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,020
thank you for going along with
my selfish decision for 2 years!

351
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,810
That wasn't the first time.

352
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,980
He's right! You've always been selfish!

353
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,490
Rear Admiral-dono, the
pirate ship is submerging!

354
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,490
What?! Damn!

355
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,890
You fools!

356
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,120
Do you have any idea...
how heinous they are? Hey!

357
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,750
Rear Admiral!

358
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,300
Take care, Luffy...

359
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,410
Spread the sail!

360
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,520
--Yes!
--Yeah!

361
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,190
Set sail!!

362
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,790
Yeah!

363
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,010
Let's go to the Fish-Man Island!

364
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,970
Having departed for the New World,

365
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,720
the Straw Hats are amazed
by the unknown underwater scenery.

366
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,350
Franky tells them about the
man who protected them.

367
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,480
But there's something dark
lurking behind the Sunny.

368
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,050
On the next episode of One Piece!

369
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,310
"A Surprising Fact!
The Man Who Guarded the Sunny!"

370
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
