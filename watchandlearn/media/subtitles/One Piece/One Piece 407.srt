2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,500
Previously...

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,780
Boss Luffy and company entered
a festival's Great Portable Shrine Race,

40
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,350
with the prize being a sacred treasure
passed down in Grand Jipang.

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,100
Together with an amnesic Brook,

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,530
they enjoyed their time before the festival.

43
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,790
But, the night before the festival,

44
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,590
everyone's shrines were destroyed
by Hogback of Thriller Co.,

45
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,890
which is bent on having the sacred treasure.

46
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,290
It's all over!

47
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,740
We can't enter the race like this!

48
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,000
Our only choice is to drop out now...

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,880
If this was all meant to destroy
their portable shrine before the race...

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,160
...then ours is in danger too!

51
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,390
I remember.

52
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,240
Your memory is back?!

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,290
Yes.

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,550
I remember everything now.

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,010
Wh-What's with that get-up?
Where are you going?

56
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,420
I should not be here.

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,480
This is because...

58
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,980
...I'm actually a member of Thriller Company.

59
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,940
And so, with his memory returned,

60
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,920
Brook disappeared into the dark night alone.

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,360
"Feudal Era Side Story -
Defeat Thriller Company's Trap"

62
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,590
That was a great rampage tonight!

63
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,460
Perona-sama should be quite pleased.

64
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,760
Who're you?!

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,270
You have strayed from the path of humanity...

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,420
Though you aren't human to begin with.

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,970
I will punish you on Heaven's behalf!

68
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,980
Oww, oww...

69
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,050
There, that should do it.

70
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,510
Thanks...

71
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,650
The race is tomorrow,
but I let them destroy the portable shrine...

72
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,190
I'm a failure as a carpenter!

73
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,810
It's not your fault, Master Builder!

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,110
So it's Hogback's cronies who're to blame...

75
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,370
Brook...

76
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,670
Where do you suppose Brook went?

77
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,290
Would you like me to tell you?

78
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,090
Who're you?!

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,910
Just a city girl who's passing by.

80
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,240
How beautiful!

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,470
Again?!

82
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,500
That skeleton was indeed a
member of Thriller Company,

83
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,180
but he grew sick of its despicable
ways and left the organization.

84
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,200
But he may feel responsible for
the shrines that were destroyed today.

85
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,610
Boss Luffy...

86
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,650
"Thriller Company"

87
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,290
Pinwheel members...

88
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,650
I will make amends for how I have lived.

89
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,830
Wait, Boss!

90
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,510
Sheesh, he never thinks things through!

91
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,480
Brook!

92
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,020
Fool!

93
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,260
I don't like hurting!

94
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,400
Shut up!

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,180
I never imagined you were still alive!

96
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,790
Not after we hurt you so much
and sent you down the river

97
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,840
when you left the organization...

98
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,400
Why have you come to throw away
the life you managed to cling to?

99
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,890
There is no point in explaining!

100
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,650
You would never understand!

101
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,310
Add another weight!

102
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,520
Right! Another weight!

103
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,230
You're acting unsightly!

104
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,070
Enough! Finish him off!

105
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,730
Hold on! Time out! I don't want to die yet!

106
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,140
Wait, I'm already long dead...

107
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,580
But I don't want this!

108
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,080
Shut the hell up!

109
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,780
Brook!

110
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,460
Boss!

111
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,060
What's the big idea, leaving like that?

112
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,880
Come on! Let's go back!

113
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,930
Not so fast!

114
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,000
You're that policeman from earlier!

115
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,450
Move.

116
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,260
You guys piss me off, but I have
no business with you right now.

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,230
We can't quietly let an enemy leave,
not even if he's a public official!

118
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,070
Destroy him!

119
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,650
You're annoying the neighborhood, dammit!

120
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,300
Three-Sword Style! Tatsu-Maki!

121
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,610
Gum-Gum Billy Club!

122
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,010
Don't falter!

123
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,610
Overwhelm them with sheer numbers!

124
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,090
There's no end to 'em!

125
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,340
They're...

126
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
...gone!

127
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,430
Where they hell did they go?! Find them!

128
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,490
We're back!

129
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,830
My word...

130
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,690
Boss! Brook! Welcome back!

131
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,370
Welcome back!

132
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,670
You must be hungry!
Have some special Stamina Rice Balls!

133
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,420
Ooh! They look yum!

134
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,980
What are you all doing?

135
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,050
We're fixing our portable shrine!

136
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,510
You can't be serious...

137
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,350
The race is tomorrow, you know!
You'll never make it in time!

138
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,020
Not if we can help it!

139
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,680
Why? Why would you go to such lengths?!

140
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,360
Pride!

141
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,290
Turning tail and running
isn't our style at all!

142
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,700
Yes!

143
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,540
We're the exact same way!

144
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,360
Rolling Express!

145
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,250
I hear you're lacking raw materials!

146
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,980
Please use any pieces you want
from our broken portable shrine!

147
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,280
You're the Flying Fish Riders!

148
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,730
We brought ours too, so you can use it!

149
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,420
We're placing our spirit in your hands!

150
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,540
Really?!

151
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,770
Guys...!

152
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,550
Now I can build a super portable
shrine just like the one I imagined!

153
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,630
That's right!

154
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,640
Let's do it!

155
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,950
Looks like we're going to
need more food for supper!

156
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,740
I'll go and make a lot!

157
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,700
Sanji-kun! We're counting on you!

158
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,660
Nami-swan!

159
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,670
Just leave it to me!

160
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,270
What's the matter, Brook?

161
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,040
Don't just stand there, help!

162
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,400
But how can I ever have the face to?

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,220
Just come on!

164
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,110
Not the knees!

165
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,900
You're already one of the
shrine bearers, you know!

166
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,230
Do I have to spell it out for you?

167
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,030
He means you're our friend.

168
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,670
Friend...?

169
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,370
Thank you!

170
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,330
Hey, you! There are no free meals, boy!

171
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh.

172
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,130
Oh! I'll play a song to liven things up!

173
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,720
Oh, I'm rarin' to go now!

174
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,400
Alright! Let's do it!

175
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,990
Yeah!

176
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,400
What is that?!

177
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,390
It's huge!

178
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,650
It's enormous!

179
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,190
None of the other entrants
even stand a chance!

180
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,630
What other entrants?

181
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,500
We destroyed everyone's shrines
and made them drop out of the race!

182
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,690
It won't be long now!

183
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,670
We only need to get this jumbo
portable shrine across the finish line

184
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,880
and the treasure's all ours!

185
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,410
Hold on, Cindry-chan! Why
are you in front of me?!

186
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,210
It's almost noon.

187
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,160
Let the victory parade begin.

188
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,450
Please wait!

189
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,470
The Pinwheel Eatery will
also be participating!

190
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,750
What?!

191
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,690
Thriller Company!

192
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,490
The treasure is ours!

193
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,190
You can do it, Pinwheel!

194
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,700
Bring it on, then!

195
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:33,160
The Great Portable Shrine Race for
the sacred treasure will now take place!

196
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
Thriller Company!

197
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,740
Pinwheel Eatery!

198
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,930
Both teams will battle it out!

199
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,720
Ready!

200
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,530
You're in the way!

201
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,720
I can't see!

202
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,410
This is no time to be foolin' around!

203
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,670
They've taken the lead!

204
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,270
My Flying Fish!

205
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,650
I'm borrowing this!

206
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,300
Thief!

207
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,950
This is too heavy, Master...

208
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,970
You feeble fools!

209
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,970
Now they'll catch up to us!

210
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,170
Stay calm!

211
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,590
The genius Hogback-sama's
portable shrine isn't on this low a level!

212
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,290
So long!

213
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,450
Huh?! What is that?!

214
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,440
Looks like it's time to
show off our true power, too!

215
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,210
Boss! Feed this cola to the shrine!

216
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,390
Okay!

217
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,810
Here?

218
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,670
Wh-Whoa!

219
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,610
Everyone get on the shrine!

220
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,900
Here we go!

221
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,800
Hey! That's against the rules!

222
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Like you're one to talk!

223
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,240
Neither one is a portable shrine anymore...

224
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,560
We're getting nowhere like this!

225
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,310
Leave it to me!

226
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,400
Try this on for size!

227
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,200
That's a cannon!

228
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,700
Look out!

229
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,700
If that's how it's gonna be...!

230
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,530
Victory is ours now!

231
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,940
This can't be!

232
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,330
Look!

233
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,600
Support Paddle!

234
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
I can't talk!

235
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,520
Keep it as a pet.

236
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,600
Guys! Keep moving along the river!

237
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,210
It's a quicker route than on land!

238
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,750
Got it!

239
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,790
You're not going anywhere!

240
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,130
Get them!

241
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,800
They just keep coming...!

242
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,910
I thought this might happen!

243
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,430
You have a trick of your own?!

244
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,530
Drive right, now!

245
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,490
Talk and you'll bite your tongue off!

246
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,570
Shut up!

247
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,010
36 Pound Phoenix!

248
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,360
It's the Grand Shrine!

249
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,950
Boss! This is the last of the cola!

250
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,790
Alright!

251
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,350
What?!

252
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,100
This sucks!

253
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,020
They're not getting away!

254
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,430
Look! It's the goal!

255
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,600
Marry me!

256
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,390
Go!

257
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,390
This...

258
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,260
...is the giant portable shrine's...

259
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,620
...true form?

260
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,960
Monkey! Monkey!

261
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,780
What a huge spider!

262
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,170
I commend you for forcing my trump card!

263
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,330
However...!

264
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,670
This is the end!

265
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,460
Spider Sticky Net!

266
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,330
We're stuck!

267
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,680
Hey! Can't you do something?!

268
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,650
I do have one last trick up my sleeve...

269
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,100
...but I'm out of cola!

270
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,390
Cola?!

271
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,200
Onami-san! Down there!

272
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,780
This is the end!

273
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,650
Monkey! Monkey!

274
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,080
Boss!

275
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,950
Win!

276
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,760
Yeah!

277
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,980
Gaon Cannon!

278
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,350
Fire!

279
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,230
No way!

280
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,730
Th-This can't be!

281
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,860
Hold on!

282
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,890
Wait, where is Cindry-chan?!

283
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,560
When did she...?!

284
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,160
W-Wait! Let's discuss this!

285
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,540
You ruined the festival everyone
was looking forward to!

286
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,040
Now you're going to pay!

287
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,090
We are?!

288
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,380
And the winner is Pinwheel Eatery!

289
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,690
Congratulations!

290
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,170
Now, then...

291
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,540
The million Ryo-Berry prize!

292
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,460
I'm afraid I'm going to have to keep this.

293
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Huh?!

294
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,410
Just look at the disastrous
state of this town!

295
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,050
You can't be serious...!

296
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,000
But...

297
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,550
As promised, the sacred treasure is yours!

298
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,910
Alright!

299
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,920
We did it!

300
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,170
I wonder what the sacred treasure is like!

301
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,500
It's been 100 years since
its last exhibition,

302
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,660
so this will be my first
time seeing it as well.

303
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,010
Okay!

304
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:18,770
This is the magical sacred treasure
passed down in Grand Jipang...

305
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,850
"Instructions for the Maiden Panties..."

306
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,130
"Make a wish with these panties on
and it will be granted forthwith."

307
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,250
"Limited to beautiful women only"?!

308
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,210
Wonderful!

309
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,570
Omao-san.

310
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,610
Do you think you could
put those panties on for me?

311
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,520
Yuck!

312
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,030
Huh? Where am I? Who am I?

313
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,110
You've lost your memory again?!

314
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,530
Brook-san!

315
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,500
After being sent flying away from
Sabaody Archipelago by Kuma,

316
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,380
Luffy lands on a unique island.

317
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,340
In the jungle, Luffy eats the
wrong mushrooms and collapse.

318
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,880
There, he is found by a group of beautiful
female warriors bearing snakes.

319
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

320
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,270
"Landing! The All-Female Island,
Amazon Lily"

321
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
