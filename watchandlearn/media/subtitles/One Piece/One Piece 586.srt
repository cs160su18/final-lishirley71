00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,250
If you want to go to the unbelievable world

Freedom is our only rule

00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,940
It's not our way to worry

At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,530

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,610
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,740
After surviving a fierce battle,

78
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,790
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

79
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,250
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

80
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,200
After receiving an emergency signal,
they landed on Punk Hazard Island.

81
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,370
It was a strange island
divided into two parts;

82
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,490
the Burning Lands and the Ice Lands.

83
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,120
Sink to your death, Devil Fruit eaters!

84
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,760
Cut that crap. Let us see
inside the laboratory.

85
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,030
I'm the only one here!

86
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,470
If Straw Hat comes, I'll
chop his head off for you.

87
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,140
If that's all you have to say, go home!

88
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,990
I made it out!

89
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,610
One, two, three...

90
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,490
Super!

91
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,240
The Straw Hats?! Children?!

92
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,210
I got out of the building! I can go home!

93
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,500
Oh, you're...!

94
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,340
I was wondering who this
villainous guy was! Smoker!

95
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,220
And you, cutie!

96
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,080
This is not good! The Navy's here!

97
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,760
We can't escape from here!
Let's look for another exit!

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,970
Get inside!

99
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,440
What brought the Navy to such a place?!

100
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,600
I don't know! Just run!

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,900
Hurry up, kids! Go to the back!

102
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,020
There should be a backdoor!

103
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,440
Everybody, let's catch the Straw Hats!

104
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,530
Room.

105
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,660
Takt!

106
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
No way!

107
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,120
"In a Real Pinch! Luffy Sinks
into the Ice-cold Lake!"

108
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,610
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND - THE
MIDDLE LAKE LUFFY'S GROUP

109
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,030
Fire!

110
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,340
Aim at the bottom of the boat!

111
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,230
Let's go back!

112
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,200
What're you talking about, Usopp?!

113
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,620
Advance!

114
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,500
You have no idea what's going on, do you?!

115
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,520
They're trying to make us fall into the lake!

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,940
You can't get away from me - Brownbeard-sama!

117
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,900
Who are you, again?

118
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,450
Don't tell me you don't know who I am!

119
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,410
I'm a former pirate with an 80
million 60 thousand berry bounty!

120
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,420
Brownbeard-sama!

121
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,960
Brownbeard-sama!

122
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,880
Brownbeard-sama! Sama...
Sama... Sama... Sama...

123
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,600
We've never heard of you!

124
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,530
How can they be so ignorant?!

125
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,740
Take this! An angry shot!

126
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,670
Damn, those bastards!

127
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,500
We're gonna fall!

128
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,050
Oh no!

129
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,430
--Yes! He did it!
--That's our Boss!

130
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,600
The boat capsized!

131
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,350
How's that?! Struggle as much as you like

132
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,150
but you'll be swallowed by the water!

133
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,210
It's cold!!

134
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,790
My body's gonna turn to ice
in a matter of minutes!

135
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,120
Dammit!

136
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,570
I'm losing my strength...

137
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,590
You could've fought back, Duffy!

138
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,220
Bud you didn't shtop recruiting zem!

139
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,830
Oh no! My mouth is freebing...

140
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,210
Zorry. I give up.

141
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,560
I don't need zem to join our crew.

142
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,650
All right! Let's finish them!

143
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,070
Get ready!

144
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Hey, Usopp!

145
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,620
Hold these two!

146
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,670
I'm gonna slice them up!

147
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,880
Please hurry up... O-Or I'm gonna...

148
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,500
It won't take long!

149
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,970
Huh? Hey, what happened, Roro?!

150
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,180
Sharks!

151
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,680
Why are sharks in a lake?!

152
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,350
Fools!

153
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,680
It's technically a sea.

154
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,550
The fight between Akainu and Aokiji left
a crater just like after an explosion.

155
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:20,200
And then seawater streamed in from
a big crack and created a lake.

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,070
Of course, so did a lot of sea life.

157
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,600
Zoro!

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,510
Sharks! Scary! Sharks! Zoro
got bitten by a shark!

159
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,470
Aim carefully! There is
nothing they can do now!

160
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,180
We have no place to go!

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
Blow them to kingdom come!

162
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,060
What?! I've never thought
my life would end like this!

163
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,400
This is it!

164
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,950
Fire!

165
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
Huh?

166
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,830
What? What happened?!

167
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,710
Brook!

168
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,150
What is colder than a freezing blizzard?

169
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,420
It's the wind from the underworld.

170
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,090
You bastard!

171
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,960
Oh, did I mention I froze your gun barrels?

172
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,080
So they'll explode if you shoot!

173
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,060
Who are you, skull mask?!

174
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,510
My name is not worth mentioning. It's Brook.

175
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,670
You just mentioned it.

176
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,420
I'm a skeleton who came back from
the dead and put my second life...

177
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,720
...in the hands of the Straw Hat captain!

178
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,310
People call me Soul King!

179
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,000
When did he freeze our guns?!

180
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,230
That's unforgivable!

181
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,480
"Unforgivable"? Right back at you!

182
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,660
--You bastard!
--How dare you?!

183
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,660
Losing friends - I'm sick of it (korigori)!

184
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,460
What?

185
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,390
And it sounds like ice (koori)!

186
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,300
He's fast! He sure can fight!

187
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,470
I didn't know they had another crewmember!

188
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,660
But it doesn't matter now!

189
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,100
Because they already became shark food.

190
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,870
See for yourself!

191
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,110
The sharks got their butts kicked!

192
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,570
Hey, where did they go?

193
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,820
We're here!

194
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,120
You're just in time, Brook.

195
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,620
I'm glad that you're okay!

196
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,840
I was chased by a strange thing
and happened to come this far.

197
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,800
Nice try, you part-human-part-animals!

198
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,580
But sharks can't stop us!

199
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,790
We're way stronger than that!

200
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,490
But no matter... how strong we are...

201
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,510
we can't stand the cold!

202
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,240
It's freezing! I'm gonna turn to ice!

203
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,560
"I TOLD YOU GUYS..." I rold you guys...

204
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,990
"WE CAN'T JUST GO TO THE
COLD SIDE LIKE THIS...

205
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,990
We can't hust go to the
cold shide like this...

206
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,540
But look. We're lucky.

207
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,210
We should be glad that we ran into them.

208
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,760
Boss, they're right on top of us!

209
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,990
Wait! They look familiar!

210
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,970
He looks good!

211
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,850
I'll take the fourth guy from the right.

212
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,310
All right!

213
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,020
I'll take the guy next to him.

214
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,890
I'll take that one.

215
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,320
The girl at the far left.

216
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,280
What are they talking about?

217
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,540
Their clothes look warm!

218
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,210
"ALL RIGHT... PLEASE GET ME ONE, TOO!"

219
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,210
All right... flease ket me one, too!

220
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,430
Are they looking to rip our coats off?!

221
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,710
They're terrible! Do they wanna rob us?!

222
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,500
I know! That hat!

223
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,270
He is the rookie of that worst
generation from two years ago!

224
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,520
What?!

225
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,230
Yeah!

226
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,150
He is Fire Fist's brother!

227
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,030
Whaaat?!

228
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,410
A pirate with a 400 million
berry bounty - Straw Hat Luffy!

229
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,200
4... 400 million?!

230
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,210
Mil Fleurs!

231
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,420
Wh-What is that?!

232
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,920
No!!

233
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,720
Give me your clothes!

234
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,210
You'd better not fight back!

235
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,820
Then I won't have to hurt you so bad!

236
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,410
Oh, my friends. You're in
better shape than I thought!

237
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,000
Help me!!

238
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,310
THE LABORATORY - IN FRONT
OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE

239
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,310
I told you, Smo-san!

240
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,250
This is why I said I didn't
want anything to do with him!

241
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,470
What should we do?!

242
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,270
Hurry up! Hi-ya! It's this way, kids!

243
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,370
We gotta find a backdoor!

244
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,820
Wait!

245
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,280
Go back! It was that man who cut me up!

246
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,320
What? Really?!

247
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
Then he may have the rest of your body?!

248
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,210
No, I don't think so!

249
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,300
Then, it can wait!

250
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,380
Wait a minute! Maybe I can get a clue!

251
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,940
We have to find a backdoor!

252
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,840
We can't go back to face the Navy again!

253
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,580
I don't see any exit! Where is the backdoor?!

254
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,060
All right! Super count on me!

255
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,310
You got some kind of sensor on you?!

256
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,620
There's no such a thing!

257
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,330
Then why did you take the lead?!

258
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,710
That was that samurai...

259
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,090
Let's go! Let's go!

260
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,740
...And the Straw Hats.

261
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,710
I can't let them escape!

262
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,020
Room!

263
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,930
What is this?! It's like a thin film...

264
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,400
Shambles!

265
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,190
What was that? I felt something weird!

266
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,920
No time to think about it now!

267
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,090
Alright, keep running, brats!

268
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,720
Oh? Did I drop my cigarette?

269
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,070
Follow me!

270
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,230
What is this?!

271
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,230
Hey, this is no time for you
to fool around, Sanji-kun!

272
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,840
In this week's episode, I'm super!

273
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,820
I'll find a backdoor in a moment!

274
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,270
What?

275
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,530
--Everybody?
--There's something wrong with you!

276
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,270
Huh? What is it?

277
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,190
Come to think of it, my
breasts feel lighter...

278
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,510
What happened?!

279
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,890
These are...! I got big breasts!

280
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,010
I-I turned into a human!

281
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,850
When did it happen? I'm a racoon now?!

282
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,310
E-Everybody, calm down!

283
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,060
Let's do a roll call!

284
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,760
--Chopper!
--Here!

285
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,600
--Franky!
--Yeah!

286
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,020
Sanji-kun?

287
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,250
What?

288
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
Nami-san?

289
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,830
You're Nami... aren't you?

290
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,510
Uh-huh!

291
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,130
What is going on here?!

292
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,970
Law, you bastard!

293
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,430
What do you want?

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,570
Give us back our ship.

295
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,560
All right.

296
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,870
Really?!

297
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,910
But you can't have it as it is now.

298
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,500
--It's falling toward us!
--Run!

299
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,320
Let's retreat for now, Vice
Admiral! His power is too creepy!

300
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,410
We can't fight him!

301
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,330
I won't let anyone leave!

302
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,460
It's been fused to the rocks of the island?!

303
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,300
He made some sort of strange
artwork with the ship!

304
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,260
Damn! We can't make it back
to the base without the ship!

305
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,060
The Warlords work for the Government!

306
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,690
You're breaking your
contract by attacking us!

307
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,730
Trafalgar!

308
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,190
--We'll report this to headquarters!
--They'll strip you of your title!

309
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,490
Don't worry about me.

310
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,650
Scan!

311
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,500
What's this?! Stop!

312
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,330
Huh? Transponder Snails?

313
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,350
Oh? Mine's gone!

314
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,420
No way... So is mine!

315
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,060
Those are ours!

316
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,300
He took all of our Transponder Snails!

317
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,940
I won't let you tell the
headquarters or the Government

318
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,810
about anything that you've
seen on this island.

319
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,030
You stupid pirate, don't push your luck!

320
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,160
Smo-yan!

321
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,330
You ate the Op-Op Fruit and you're
the Modification Man, I believe!

322
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,250
Stay out of his sword's reach!

323
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,980
I got cut!

324
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,140
Huh? But I'm alive!

325
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,260
You guys are in my way!
Get out of the circle!

326
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,390
The circle?!

327
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,560
While you're in the circle he created,

328
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,960
you're like a patient on an operating table!

329
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,590
This is his operating room.

330
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,110
He has total control over it and can
manipulate anything as he pleases!

331
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,740
He's the Surgeon of Death!

332
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,410
Trafalgar!

333
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,990
If you really wanna do this...

334
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,620
Don't do it, Tashigi!

335
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,870
Your Haki is not strong enough!

336
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,700
Captain-chan!

337
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,960
With Tashigi being cut down,

338
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,090
the thugs of the Navy's G-5 unit were
also about to face annihilation.

339
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,800
But then Smoker faces Law.

340
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,720
A duel between a Warlord and a
Navy Vice-Admiral finally begins.

341
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,180
Their fierce battle that destroys
everything around them

342
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,810
suddenly takes an unexpected turn.

343
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,110
On the next episode of One Piece!

344
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,710
"Meeting Again After Two Years!
Luffy and Law!"

345
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,810
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
