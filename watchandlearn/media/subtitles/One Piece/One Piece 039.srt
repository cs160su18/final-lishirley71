2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,660
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,110
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,730
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,140
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,840
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,160
Luffy...

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,510
Help me...

26
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,350
Don't make our navigator cry!

27
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,140
Gum-Gum...

28
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,030
...Pinwheel!!

29
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,110
What the... What the...

30
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,710
People with Devil Fruit
powers can't swim.

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,580
Though, even people without
powers would sink in this situation.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,260
He's gonna throw him into the sea?!

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,030
Gum-Gum Pistol!

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,870
Darn you!

35
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,410
Luffy!!

36
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,500
Damn you!

37
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,240
This is bad... I'm out of strength...

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,890
"Luffy Submerged!
Zoro vs. Hatchan the Octopus"

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,580
What do you think?
Isn't this a pretty fun game?

40
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,330
How many minutes will
that rubber man last?

41
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,220
Or will you guys die before that?

42
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,670
This isn't good, Johnny.
Big Bro Luffy is in big trouble...

43
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,220
He can't help himself now!

44
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,870
We'll defeat him in five seconds.
Luffy! I'll come rescue you right away!

45
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,290
Hachi Ink Jet!

46
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,960
My hair! You bastard! I'm gonna...

47
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,560
...forgive you since it's just hair
and it's gonna grow back.

48
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,000
Huh?

49
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,640
Roronoa Zoro!

50
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,640
You can't cut me
because I have six hands.

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,730
Go ahead and cut me if you can!

52
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,640
You Octo-Man!

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,240
Hachi's... Triple... Sword... Catch!

54
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,650
Ouch!

55
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,480
I don't have time to play with you!

56
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,860
He throws me out of whack!

57
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,740
Could he possibly...

58
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,720
If you're not paying attention,
you'll shorten your life!

59
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,750
Fish shouldn't go against a cook!

60
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,870
We're running out of time... No time...

61
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,050
Go down already!

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,090
Hachi Suckers!

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,510
So what?! Come down already!

64
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
You damn octopus!

65
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,630
That octopus bastard!
He's moving wobbly and slowly!

66
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,760
But then, if he goes
into the sea now,

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,180
he'll be dragged to
the bottom of the sea.

68
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,490
But at this rate,
Big Bro Luffy's going to die!

69
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,310
We have to do something about it!

70
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,830
Yeah!

71
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,310
Wait!

72
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,810
Ouch!!

73
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,510
What're you going to do in
the sea with such serious injuries?

74
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,240
You can't do much like that.

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,990
If you're talking about that rubber
young man, I'll go and rescue him.

76
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,470
Y-You will?

77
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,210
Whether we can save
that young man or not

78
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,530
is probably what will
decide this fight, right?

79
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,000
I can tell that, too.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,950
Gen-san!

81
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,740
I'll go, too!

82
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll go, too!

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,340
Me, too!

84
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,320
No! If many of us go
and take time rescuing him,

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,180
the fishmen will notice and it will
cause these people trouble, if anything.

86
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,930
Gen-san!

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,590
It'll be pointless if we end up
putting a crimp in their fight.

88
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,920
So I'll do it alone.

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
That's okay with you two, right?

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,910
Sorry... Thank you!

91
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,340
I'll leave it to you.
Sorry, but please be quick.

92
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,600
Wait!

93
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,510
Gen-san, I'll go, too.

94
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,630
Nojiko, you're injured!

95
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,390
Those guys're fighting
for my little sister!

96
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,020
Gen-san!

97
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Okay. Come with me.

98
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,760
Let's hurry!

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,480
Okay!

100
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,220
I'm sorry...

101
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,010
If only we were a little stronger...

102
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,880
Please save... Big Bro...

103
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,850
You damn fish man!

104
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,060
Roronoa Zoro! Do you mind if I ask
you a question? You don't, right?

105
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,950
I heard you use the Three Swords Style.
Why are you using only one sword?

106
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,280
You're already losing
big with one sword!

107
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,290
Sh-Shut up! I'm not fighting seriously!

108
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,280
Actually, there's a reason that
a human swordsman can't defeat me.

109
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
Wanna hear what it is?
You wanna hear it, right?

110
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,240
When you hear it, you'll be
surprised, scared, blown away!

111
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,640
Dammit! I can't be in pain right now!

112
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
My fever's getting worse, too!

113
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,270
I thought it would come down
while I was moving around, but...

114
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,850
Just as I thought, the wounds...

115
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,820
...from your fight with Hawk-Eye are...

116
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,520
Big Bro!

117
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,060
What're you doing?

118
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,870
Are you trying to fake
illness or something?

119
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,460
I won't fall for that. Roronoa Zoro!

120
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,130
Just check out my true form!

121
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,370
Look! This is my true form!

122
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,940
Here comes Hachi,
user of the Six Swords Style!

123
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,820
Hey! That's not where you're
supposed to fall! Don't mock me!

124
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,920
--Ah! Big Bro!
--So he was bearing the pain!

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
--Ah! Big Bro!
--So he was bearing the pain!

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,390
Yeah. His injuries would
kill a normal person

127
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,960
or leave them bedridden for half a year!

128
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,680
What?!

129
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,630
I thought something was strange.

130
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,200
He looked as if nothing had happened
right after that fierce fight.

131
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,580
Is he an idiot or what?!

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,170
I thought I warned you
to pay attention.

133
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,890
I have a fortieth dan
in Fishman Karate.

134
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,650
Wh-What? Someone went flying?!

135
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,560
B-Big Bro?!

136
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,020
Big Bro Cook!

137
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,650
Ahh...

138
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,370
Big Bro Cook!!

139
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,770
He's been taken care of, Arlong-san.

140
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,610
What do we do with Roronoa Zoro?

141
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,610
Just ditch him in the sea.
What weaklings... How boring!

142
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,860
That's all?

143
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,620
Geez, they sure did
a lot of damage, though.

144
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,450
It's no big deal.

145
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,500
Arlong Park can't be destroyed
by this kind of damage.

146
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,830
Indeed...

147
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,560
How dare you, Roronoa Zoro!

148
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,190
You died from shock before I,
the great swordsman, could attack you?!

149
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,000
You could have left your name
in history if you died at least

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,140
after receiving my
Six Swords Style attack.

151
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,050
Well, no matter how you struggle or
even if the world is turned upside down,

152
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:02,970
you humans can't even give a
scratch to me, wielder of six swords!

153
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,420
Stop it, Hachi. I know how you feel,

154
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,990
but if you really go on a
rampage we'll be in trouble.

155
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,540
Are you going to destroy Arlong Park?

156
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,330
Oh! Ahh...

157
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,290
N-no... Sorry.

158
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,280
I got too worked up...

159
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,110
Don't get carried away.

160
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,250
You're right. Sorry.

161
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,960
The Six Swords Style, huh?
What a joke!

162
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,490
Big Bro!!

163
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,590
Roronoa Zoro!

164
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,260
I'll tell you one thing, octopus.

165
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,490
There's a man I need to meet up with.

166
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,900
Until I see him again...

167
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,970
...my life can't be taken away
even by Death himself!

168
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,660
Damn that Long-nose! What speed!

169
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,440
That guy's face and ability
to run away aren't human!

170
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,670
If I keep one of the Arlong Pirates
leaders away like this,

171
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,240
it should be beneficial to Luffy
and the other's fights.

172
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,680
Good job, Usopp-sama!
How considerate you are towards them!

173
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,980
Though it just happened
to turn out that way...

174
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,020
Whoa, as I expected,
he isn't catching up.

175
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,930
Darn. This isn't good.
Looks like I've got quite a lead.

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,030
Fishmen are just turtles
on land, after all.

177
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,640
He's far behind in no time.

178
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,650
Turtles... huh?

179
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,600
Hey! Hey! Turtle! You slow turtle!
Keep up with me if you can!

180
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,430
I'll outrun you again right away!
You waddling turtle!

181
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,970
Aren't you the one
who'll have to waddle?

182
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,920
Ughhhhh!

183
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,780
Stop, you bastard!

184
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,060
He drank quite a bit of water.

185
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,840
We need to bring him up
soon or it'll be too late.

186
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,430
Dammit! I guess I can't
break it in the sea.

187
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,000
The buoyancy is too strong.

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,340
Gen-san, hurry up.

189
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,420
No good. I can't smash the rock.

190
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,600
An oxygen cylinder would be helpful
but we don't have time to go get it.

191
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,990
And we can't carry him up
along with the rock, either...

192
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,690
Oh, yeah!

193
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,340
Hm? Ahh!

194
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,570
That man's still alive!!

195
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,800
Big Bro! Big Bro Cook!!

196
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,580
That fishman's punch was
a fortieth dan punch? I see...

197
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,920
Then those kicks I used to take all
the time from that damn geezer

198
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,740
are four-hundredth dan kicks.

199
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,860
What is it, Roronoa Zoro?

200
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,020
I'm not sure what's going on,
but you look like you're in pain.

201
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,000
You think you can defeat my
Six Swords Style in that condition?

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,880
Everyone in the whole world
thinks the same way.

203
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,370
That's none of your business.

204
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,670
Big Bro's in really bad shape!

205
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,010
He's probably got a
fever from his wounds

206
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,880
and must be barely conscious.

207
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,570
If those wounds open up,
he's definitely going to die!

208
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,480
But it's no time to think
about things like that!

209
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,360
Yeah! He's the only one who can
break through this situation!

210
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,560
I'll show you the Three Swords Style.

211
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,380
Yosaku! Johnny!
Let me use your swords!

212
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,810
Of course!

213
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,330
Big Bro! Catch these!!

214
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,440
Darn! I feel like
I'm about to pass out.

215
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,500
I wonder how long
I can keep standing...

216
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,640
Big Bro! We threw our swords!

217
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,920
You said you wanted to
use them! Catch them!

218
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,560
Ha! I'll show you the wall that you
humans with two arms can't surpass!

219
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,620
Six Swords Style!

220
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,330
Big Bro! Watch out!!

221
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,540
Tentacle-Sword Overload!

222
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,950
Big Bro!!

223
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Three Sword Style!

224
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,260
Streaming Wolf-Swords!

225
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,780
He did it!

226
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,060
He handled the six-sword
random hits! He's really amazing!!

227
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,670
What concentration!
What spiritual strength!

228
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,370
Ahh... How dare you have
the impudence to do such a thing!

229
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm really mad, you son of a bitch!

230
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm gonna kill you!

231
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,880
If you just think about it,
you should know!

232
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,150
I can hold six swords, so there's
no way you can defeat me

233
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,150
when you can hold only
three swords! Isn't that right?!

234
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,100
Just think about it?
What a big miscalculation.

235
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,060
What do you bear on your shoulders?

236
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,270
What do you desire once
you've obtained power?

237
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,330
I'm going to get stronger for her, too!

238
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,650
I'm going to get strong enough
that my name reaches to Heaven!

239
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm going to be the world's
strongest swordsman!

240
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,350
Whether it's three swords...
or six swords...

241
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,670
...it doesn't matter!

242
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,150
Your sword and my sword
carry different weight!

243
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,410
Weight, you said?

244
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,000
I see. So your swords are heavy.

245
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,680
But my swords weigh at
least 300 kilos per sword

246
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,310
though they may not look like it.

247
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,080
They weigh a lot more than you
humans' swords, you bastard!

248
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,810
There's no point in
discussing with an idiot.

249
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,260
Six Swords Style!
Octopus Pot Stance!

250
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,640
New Year's...

251
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,510
...Open!

252
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,950
Body Slam!

253
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,180
That's dirty! He hit him
right in his wounds!

254
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,410
That'll show you!

255
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,450
Big Bro!!

256
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,740
He's gonna die!!

257
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,080
I won't let you land
while you're still alive!

258
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,910
Six Sword Ultimate Technique!

259
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,610
Waltz of Six Swords!

260
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,310
You'll be mincemeat if you touch it
even for a second! Become mincemeat!

261
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,960
Big Bro!!

262
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,880
What?!

263
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,580
Ow!

264
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,970
Big Bro!!

265
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,520
That bastard! He rolled on
my swords adjusting to the spin!

266
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,700
On top of that, he gave me
a free hand cutting service!

267
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,980
How dare he make fun of me!
I'm not a circus acrobat!

268
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,480
I'm completely angry now!
I won't let him get away!

269
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,280
I'm gonna really kill him good!

270
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,260
Big Bro... he looks like
he's in a lot of pain...

271
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,130
His wounds might've
opened with that attack.

272
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,930
Ahh... If I could, I'd wanna
take his place for him...

273
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,720
Even if it's an injury that knocks
ordinary people out, I must not fall.

274
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,660
Six Swords Style!
Octopus Pot Stance!

275
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,120
It's all over!

276
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,280
Even if it's an injury that kills
ordinary people, I must not die!

277
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,220
New Year's...

278
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,810
In order to defeat the
extraordinarily strong Hawk-Eye,

279
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,160
I can't just be ordinary!

280
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,690
Dragon Twister!!

281
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,860
Hachi...

282
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:25,640
How could I be... defeated by...
the Three Swords Style?

283
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,800
Octo-Man...

284
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,110
You now know the difference between
the weight in our swords, right?

285
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,630
Are you happy now?

286
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,110
I cried as much as I wanted.
I've whined enough, too.

287
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,230
And I'm resolved as well!

288
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,660
I have to go. Everyone's fighting!

289
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,390
Sorry, but I don't care
about that Octo-Man.

290
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,910
I have to hurry up and rescue Luffy...

291
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,350
Big Bro! Watch out!!

292
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,450
How dare you beat Hachi!

293
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,040
You...

294
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,220
You sure did send me flying!

295
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,860
Oh? I didn't know there was someone

296
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,180
in the East Blue who
could survive my fist.

297
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,640
There're probably many...
especially at a certain restaurant.

298
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,340
You sure take me lightly, don't you?

299
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,710
B-Big Bro! That's reckless!

300
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,960
Hey, stop it!

301
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,390
You'll die if you go into the
sea with wounds like that!

302
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,070
Shut up! He's at his limit!

303
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,660
There's no time to wait
until your fight is over!

304
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,290
Yeah, I know.

305
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,330
There's no time to waste
any more. I know that much.

306
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm trying to stop you when
I'm fully aware of that!

307
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,740
You just shut up, you damn idiot!

308
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,970
You can't complain if I do this, right?!

309
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,690
This is interesting!

310
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,840
He wants to fight against me,
a fishman, in the water?

311
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,130
He's a real idiot!

312
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,360
That's reckless! Fighting in
the water is what they want!

313
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,630
If I remember correctly,
he's from Cocoyashi Village...

314
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,750
His neck! Luffy's neck is stretched!

315
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,140
Sorry, I'm not strong enough
to pull the whole body.

316
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,010
Spit out water with your neck stretched.
Please at least breathe!

317
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,720
Come back to life!
I hope it's not too late!

318
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,970
I'd better hurry up before I
can't hold my breath any more.

319
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,320
I see... He can't break the rock,

320
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,990
but if Luffy's neck is stretched above
the water, he can at least breathe.

321
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,970
Which means if I kick and break that
rock, I can leave the rest to that man.

322
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,070
Fishman Karate... Forearm Sledge!

323
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,650
Realize... that you all are mere humans!

324
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,870
Come back to life!

325
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,240
Please... hurry!

326
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,060
This guy's persistent! Ughhh!

327
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

328
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

329
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

330
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

331
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

332
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

333
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

334
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

335
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

336
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

337
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

338
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,310
Ughhh!

339
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,860
Dammit! That topknot bastard!
He's attacking me from behind!

340
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,310
This isn't good!

341
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,980
But in order to rescue Luffy...

342
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,480
Even if I'm at a disadvantage,
I'll beat him up for sure!

343
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,320
It's all for Nami-san.

344
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,650
So that's what you're
thinking after all!

345
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,550
Waaaah!!

346
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,660
Shut up!!

347
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

348
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,330
"Proud Warriors!
Sanji and Usopp's Fierce Battles"

349
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,370
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
