00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,940
We made it!

22
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,640
Ah! So that's the second island
in the Grand Line-- Little Garden!

23
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,570
W-What's with this island?!

24
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,870
Collier Shoot!

25
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,140
L-Little Garden?!

26
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,390
W-What's so little...

27
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,810
...about this island?!

28
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,670
This is an island of ancient times.

29
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,730
It's stuck in the age of the dinosaurs!

30
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,980
The duel has continued for 100 years now.

31
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,720
I've forgotten the reason for it.

32
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,580
But that doesn't matter, anyway.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,610
Then why?!

34
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,800
Pride!

35
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,380
Man, he's huge...

36
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,320
This is Elbaf, the god of war's...

37
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,000
...judgment!

38
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,050
I didn't have his divine protection.

39
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,510
Who is it?! Come out!

40
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,690
You guys spoiled
the old giant guys' duel!

41
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,140
I'm gonna beat you up!

42
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,780
It's no use!

43
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:38,770
Your friends are going
to become my works of art!

44
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,180
Luffy!

45
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,770
Ahh. Such nice tea...

46
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,610
Luffy! What are you doing?!

47
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,600
Such... nice... tea...

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,390
Luffy!

49
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,200
What are you doing, you idiot?!

50
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,250
It's over for all of you.

51
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,550
This is my ultimate ability!

52
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,290
Special Attack: Exploding Star!

53
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,250
"Time to Fight Back!
Usopp's Quick Thinking and Fire Star!"

54
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,630
What an idiot! He missed his
target and hit his own friend!

55
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,490
Where'd his bullets go?!

56
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,580
Breeze Breath Bomb!

57
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,200
I forgot to mention it,
but my breath explodes.

58
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,950
Dammit! This is insane!
He had no bullets?!

59
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,940
Karoo! You alright?!

60
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,040
Hey! You come to your senses?!

61
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,390
Y-Yeah...

62
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm awake! Thanks!

63
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,580
That attack was meant to burn
his clothes and the trap on it

64
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,120
to undo the mental manipulation!

65
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,070
I've had enough of that paint!

66
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,550
I refuse to let anyone else die!

67
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,510
Now I'm mad!

68
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,090
It's definitely weird. Damn weird.

69
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,980
Why hasn't anyone come
back after all this time?

70
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,860
Something must've happened to
Nami-san, Vivi-chan, and the rest.

71
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,280
In which case, this is no time to
be getting ready to cook a lizard!

72
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,140
Nami-san! Vivi-chan!

73
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,950
Hey! Say something! I love you!

74
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,350
What's this?

75
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,850
So what if you're mad?
Just look at your friends now!

76
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,570
So what?! They're still alive!

77
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,410
Are they, now?

78
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,950
All they need now is some
of Miss Golden Week's paint

79
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,800
and they'll be exceptional wax figures!

80
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,810
You're too late, Straw Hat!

81
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,260
That's correct!

82
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,700
You're not only late, but now you
can experience even more despair!

83
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,210
Move out!

84
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,730
Candle...

85
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,480
...Champion!

86
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,780
What's that?

87
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,230
It's said he once took down a
42 million-Berry bounty with this.

88
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,730
It's Mr. 3's ultimate artistic talent.

89
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,910
Now, Miss Golden Week!
Perform an artistic paint job on me!

90
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,710
Can I take a break after that?

91
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,860
Yes, of course! I'd actually
prefer you to stay out of this!

92
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,240
Like this, I am invincible!

93
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,120
This armor is as hard as iron,
and wrapped around me like velvet!

94
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,590
My form now...

95
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,880
...has no flaws!

96
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,410
S-So cool!

97
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,780
This is no time to be admiring him! Fight!

98
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,500
Alright! Gum-Gum...

99
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,240
Paint job complete!

100
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,910
Now, then!

101
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,090
...Pistol!

102
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,850
Champ Fight! Harvest Field!

103
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,470
Gum-Gum...

104
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,040
...Stamp!

105
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,140
It's no use!

106
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,590
Not good! The guy's so solid
his attacks don't work!

107
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,490
Damn! The wax haze!

108
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,920
Wax?

109
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,650
Yeah! Why didn't I realize it?!

110
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,490
The fact it turns into
a mist means it can melt!

111
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,110
Luffy! Fire melts this guy's wax!

112
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,650
No matter how hard it is,
wax is still wax!

113
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,430
Zoro and all the others
hardened only moments ago!

114
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,660
We can save them!

115
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,290
What?! For reals?!

116
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,710
Yeah, for reals.

117
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,400
Don't admit that to them!

118
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,820
But even if you realize that now,

119
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,460
you have neither time
nor a chance of winning!

120
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,570
30 more seconds at most!

121
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,870
After that, their hearts
will completely stop!

122
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,880
As we speak, they're
probably writhing in pain

123
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,480
with what little consciousness
they have left

124
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,410
as they experience
the terror of dying!

125
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,050
We don't need 30 seconds!
I'll save them now!

126
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,020
Special Attack: Fire--

127
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Breeze Breath Bomb!

128
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,430
Usopp!

129
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,540
Did you not hear him say you
have no chance of winning?

130
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,040
Dammit! There's no time!

131
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,090
Give it up!

132
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,920
Listen... Take this rope...

133
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,030
Oh? This looks like fun!

134
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,310
Whatcha planning?
Can I join in, too?

135
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,320
Karoo! Run!

136
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,640
Run!

137
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,660
Just run around all the candlesticks!

138
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,660
Everything you try is pointless!

139
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,050
Pardon me.

140
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Crescendo Stone!

141
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,630
How many kilograms
can you endure, I wonder...

142
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,560
10 kilograms...

143
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,670
100 kilograms...

144
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,120
200 kilograms...

145
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,820
300 kilograms!

146
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,090
Damn nimble bird!

147
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,230
Give it up! Give it up!

148
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,700
They've become my works of art!

149
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,920
I don't think so!

150
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,070
I won't let you have their lives!

151
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,510
If fire can melt them,
then I'll use this fire!

152
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,290
Don't pull! Stop!

153
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,800
Luffy! That small flame
won't do it fast enough!

154
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,280
Light Karoo's rope on fire!

155
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,230
The bird's rope?!

156
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,330
It's a special rope...

157
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,050
...soaked in oil!

158
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,520
Okay! Everyone! Wake up!

159
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,520
Hey! Wait! Stop!

160
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,310
It'll be a little hot, but endure it...

161
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,700
Stop!

162
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,220
Oww! Hot! Hot!

163
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,480
What a big fire!
Are they gonna be alright?!

164
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,000
Curse you... Curse you, Straw Hat!

165
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,240
How dare you destroy
my Candle Service Set?!

166
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,950
You'll pay for this!

167
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,410
I won't let you get away, you jerks!

168
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,960
Damn it! How dare you mock us?!

169
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,870
Now you've done it!

170
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,010
Playtime is over!

171
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,360
I'm going to shatter that
neck of yours into pieces!

172
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,110
Special Attack:
10,000 Kilogram Guillotine!

173
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,560
This is bad!

174
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760
That was hot! Couldn't you
have done it a different way?

175
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,300
Don't be fussy!
Just be thankful you were saved!

176
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,540
You're right. Thanks!

177
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,510
This doesn't seem real... We're alive!

178
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,340
The wax melted.

179
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,990
What a pain! We can't afford to
screw up our mission any further!

180
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,950
Mr. 5!

181
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,310
Special Attack: Exploding Star!

182
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,020
Fool! I've shown several times
that explosives don't work on me!

183
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,290
I'm an "explosive man"!

184
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,750
You took the bait!

185
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,850
So sorry! I'm a liar, you see!

186
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,830
That wasn't an Exploding Star!
It was a Special Tabasco Star!

187
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,260
Spicy!

188
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,400
I already proved its
effectiveness the hard way!

189
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,620
Damn you pirates!

190
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,320
How dare you make a mockery of me?!

191
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,660
Time to blow up in a full-body explosion!

192
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,280
There won't even be bone fragments left!

193
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,450
No! Stop!

194
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,620
Usopp!

195
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,350
No! I'm sorry! I won't do it anymore!

196
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,260
Flaming Oni...

197
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,410
...Giri!

198
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,640
Flaming swords aren't too shabby.

199
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,650
Zoro!

200
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,790
Yo. Good to see you're alive.

201
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,040
Yeah.

202
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,800
Master...

203
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,870
That leaves two foes left.

204
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,530
Bird!

205
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,260
Don't let them get away with this!

206
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,210
Real men don't spoil people's fights!

207
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,870
How good of you to come!
Welcome to my Wax-Wax Manor!

208
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,390
What is this?!

209
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,360
Well, then. Can you tell where I am?

210
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,380
It would appear you picked a
fight with the wrong people!

211
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,760
We're the most intellectual
team in all of Baroque Works!

212
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:46,930
A brute-force buffoon like you who
acts on instinct cannot catch us!

213
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,980
I am Mr. 3. I carry out all
assignments given to me flawlessly.

214
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,270
Now, then! Step forward!

215
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,840
The moment your back is
turned to me, I'll stab you...

216
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,240
...right through the heart.

217
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,050
Gum-Gum...

218
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,470
...Stamp!

219
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,230
How... did you know...

220
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,910
...I was here?

221
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,330
A hunch.

222
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,850
Afternoons are definitely
best with Earl Grey.

223
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,580
Hold on, now!

224
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,320
This is no time for me to be
drinking tea all fancy-like!

225
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,290
Nami-san and the others might
be waiting for me to help them!

226
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:04,320
Still, though. What's such a
relaxing place doing in the jungle?

227
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,590
What's that?

228
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,150
Oh...

229
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,870
It's a Transponder Snail.

230
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,430
Heya. You've called the Damn Restaurant.

231
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,150
You want reservations?

232
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,490
Quit fooling around, dumbass.

233
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,880
Aren't you a bit late with your report?

234
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,940
Oh? Report?

235
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,600
And who might I be talking to?

236
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,790
It's me.

237
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,240
Mr. 0.

238
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

239
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

240
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

241
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

242
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,420
So even...

243
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,630
...if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

244
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,840
the ship will continue forward

245
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,940
Bon voyage!

246
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget about them!

247
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,950
I know I'm a fool, but I gotta go

248
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,620
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

249
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,290
I know I'm a fool, but I'm gonna fight

250
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,300
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

251
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,940
Do everything you can, and you'll
get a little nearer to any horizon

252
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,110
got my hands on this...

253
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,220
An Eternal Pose to Alabasta!

254
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,070
Yes!

255
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,080
Now we can set sail!

256
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,090
Alright, everyone!
Let's have a rice cracker party!

257
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh, no! We only have three left!
We can't have a rice cracker party!

258
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,670
You know this is no time for that!

259
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,760
Let's go, Captain! We don't
have time to be lounging around!

260
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

261
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
"Farewell, Giant Island!
Head for Alabasta"

262
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,010
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
