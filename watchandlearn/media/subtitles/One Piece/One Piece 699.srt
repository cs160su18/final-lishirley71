69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,380
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,600
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,650
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,210
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,320
they were trapped along
with the entire island.

83
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,540
On top of that, he put prices on
the heads of Luffy and 11 others,

84
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,910
and now they're being hunted
by all the citizens.

85
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,250
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

86
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,840
Luffy and Law finally got to the Royal Palace
where Doflamingo is!

87
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,830
I'm gonna kick his ass now!

88
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,510
He's pissing me off!

89
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,600
Idiot! I told you it's our ultimate stratagem!
I also told you not to get heated!

90
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,440
I'm gonna do it now! Gum-Gum...

91
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,900
Shambles!

92
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,370
...Red Hawk!

93
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,010
Radio Knife.

94
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,490
Straw Hat-ya! You're the worst!

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,420
"A Noble Family!
The True Identity of Doflamingo!"

96
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,460
How do you like that, bastard?!

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,650
Are you all right, Doffy?!

98
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,930
L-Law, you fool!
You're not gonna get away with this!

99
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,860
Straw Hat...

100
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,430
That was quite a blow!

101
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,490
See?! It didn't kill him!

102
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,500
That strategy will never work again!

103
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,980
Strategy?

104
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,420
You shitty brats!
You're messing with me!

105
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,370
A fake one, again?!

106
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,460
Dammit! That jerk!

107
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,810
I have no business with the fake-mingo!

108
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,490
It's an all-or-nothing gamble.

109
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,580
I'm determined to bet my life on it.

110
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,670
If you lose your dice,
the game is over before you can even roll.

111
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,260
Hello? Hello?!

112
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,470
Hello?
Are you listening, Sabo-kun?!

113
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,640
I am listening!

114
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,030
Don't lie! You're not listening at all!

115
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,160
You've been absent-minded the whole time!

116
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,480
Look! You have a position now!

117
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,730
You can't get emotional
and fight a guy like the Navy admiral!

118
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
Do you wanna lead
the Revolutionary Army into war?

119
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,080
My brother's in danger! I don't care!

120
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,660
--You should!
--Nah!

121
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,790
I don't wanna get dragged into a mess
by your recklessness!

122
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,290
--Scrwew iwt!
--What?!

123
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,160
An' dat guy is...

124
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,770
We are birds of a feather.

125
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,170
We Navy and Doflamingo are both
out of place.

126
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,990
The Navy will never be a hero
in this country.

127
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,850
If somebody notices that's
what you're thinking...

128
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,980
No.

129
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,100
I was just being blocked by you...

130
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,150
It's like a gamble.

131
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,570
I'm sort of a lucky man.

132
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,360
Okay?!
Understood?! Were you listening?!

133
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,850
You...

134
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,750
Sah... boh... -kun?!

135
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,070
Why're you always like that?!

136
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,950
You do what you like
while others are worried

137
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,440
about you like hell!

138
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,310
And Hack and I are forced
to clean up your mess!

139
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,260
I'm not your babysitter!

140
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Come on! Hack and I always get chewed out

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,820
because of your selfish actions!

142
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,580
Ouch!

143
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,550
Navy Admiral Fujitora, huh?

144
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,520
Okay, done.

145
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,040
We'll lure the other criminals
using these criminals.

146
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,290
Please! Let go of me!

147
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,030
--Let's move on with the luring plan!
--Okay!

148
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,630
--Stop!
--Outta my way!

149
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,850
It's pirates!

150
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,930
Found him!

151
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,750
The 500 million prize - God Usopp!

152
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,570
We'll kill him and make a name
for our pirate group instantly!

153
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,770
Wait a sec! They're important hostages
to end the game!

154
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,070
Don't kill them!

155
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,340
Stop your hypocrisy!

156
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,970
It's the same if you hand
them over to Doflamingo!

157
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,960
What a pain... Let's kick all of their asses!

158
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,840
--H-Help!
--Do it! Do it!

159
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,360
Don't get behind!

160
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,340
Get out of our way!

161
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,470
H-Help... Please don't...

162
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,030
Don't hurt those citizens anymore!

163
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,030
If you want to do that, fight me first!

164
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,150
You shithead!

165
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,830
Guys! Get him!

166
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,250
King Riku-sama...

167
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,380
Tank! Hack! I need your help!

168
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,750
--Yes, sir!
--Roger!

169
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Dammit!

170
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,720
Get away!

171
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,690
K-King Riku-sama...

172
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,640
--You didn't get hurt?
--N-No!

173
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,350
--Good!
--King Riku-sama...

174
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,820
--Kill King Riku!
--Kick his ass!

175
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,740
I won't let you guys lay a finger
on the citizens!

176
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,540
--King Riku-sama, we got them all.
--Good.

177
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,450
It hurts, doesn't it?
I'll give you first aid for now.

178
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,190
The old King Riku, he's awesome!

179
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,310
I'm sorry! I really am! No! Help!

180
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,290
What?

181
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,270
Wh-Why...?

182
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,520
Oh! I'm free!

183
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,070
Guys, is it okay to release us?

184
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,070
We shouldn't have done that.

185
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,580
For a decade, we were holding
a grudge against King Riku-sama

186
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,450
who was just manipulated by
Doflamingo for one night.

187
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,620
And we didn't even notice that
we had lost our loved ones.

188
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,710
We praised the king who was a pirate

189
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,330
and even after we learned the truth...

190
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,620
even after we learned the truth...

191
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,260
We were still looking for salvation
in the game he started!

192
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,880
We don't even know
what we're doing anymore...

193
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,230
What's gonna happen to us...?

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,610
What's gonna happen to this country?!

195
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,410
King Riku-sama... please save us!

196
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,660
Wh-What the...

197
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,540
--What happened to them?!
--What's going on?!

198
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,860
King Riku-sama!
What are we supposed to do?!

199
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,030
If you tell us to fight, we'll take up arms!

200
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,760
--King Riku-sama!
--We'll follow you!

201
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,570
Shall we wait... for a while?

202
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,190
What? Wait?

203
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,680
It won't be too late to choose death.

204
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,160
Why are they so important to you?!
They're pirates!

205
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,460
Yes, they're unlawful men - who will break
this country's deceptive peace!

206
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,970
Father-sama, I decided to trust them,
the Straw Hat Pirates!

207
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,140
At least, the words of Straw
Hat and the others are humane

208
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,810
and they take actions
out of the goodness of their hearts!

209
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,980
I have been believing in Luffy-kun and
the others' victory without realizing...

210
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,620
Navy Admiral Fujitora?!

211
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,980
Dressrosa was once the symbol of peace.

212
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,640
I won't let you get involved in a war.

213
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,430
Wh-Wh-Wh-Why the hell is he here?!

214
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,040
King Riku, sir.

215
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,250
I'm betting on the same one as you.

216
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
On the "Straw" and...

217
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,070
...nothing else!

218
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,550
Take a good look at this country!
If I stop now, what's gonna happen to it?!

219
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,810
Special Long-Range Attack! Bagworm!

220
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,020
Cien Fleurs!

221
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,100
Strong Right!

222
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,690
Three-Sword Style!

223
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,110
Thousand-and-Eighty Pound Phoenix!

224
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,580
I'll take you down!

225
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,000
Mingo!!

226
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,920
I'll take you down!

227
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,270
Mingo!!

228
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,110
Bullet String!

229
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,700
Bullet String!

230
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,330
Yeah, Doffy! That serves him right!

231
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,170
Law! I know all about your ability!

232
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,640
Because the ability of the Op-Op Fruit was
something we sought in the first place!

233
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,940
Even if I got chopped up,
I'm gonna turn back to normal!

234
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,840
Ready to fight back!

235
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,660
Oh?

236
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,640
Oh?!

237
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,950
Oh? Why is it?

238
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,890
Radio Knife is a different cutting method
from my regular Amputation.

239
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,630
For several minutes, even with any
treatment or ability, your body...

240
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,290
...can't be reassembled!

241
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,010
What?! I'm in trouble!

242
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,010
Can't help my nose running!

243
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,470
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

244
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,270
I can't stop snotting!

245
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,560
Damn!

246
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,690
Gum-Gum Pistol!

247
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,530
Go away, Law!

248
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,330
Did you forget that I used
to treat you kindly?!

249
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,410
Room!

250
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,380
Stop! You traitor!

251
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,130
Injection!

252
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,180
Take this! Snot Blade-Catcher!

253
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,370
Shot!

254
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,820
Here's the finisher!

255
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,990
Fallbright!

256
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,240
Tra-guy!

257
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,460
I won't forgive anyone who
messes with my Family!

258
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,010
Do you remember
what I hate the most, Law?

259
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,180
To be looked down upon!

260
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,970
Tra-guy!

261
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,450
What? Suddenly, my body gets...

262
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,520
S-Stop!

263
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,190
Stop it! You stay away!

264
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,640
Get away!

265
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,560
Get away, Straw Hat!

266
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,640
Dodge!

267
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,270
--Bella...
--Dammit!!

268
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,810
Straw Hat-ya!

269
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,400
They're all beaten!

270
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,850
Did you think you could take me down?

271
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,970
The fact that shitty brats
like you guys got conceited

272
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,770
and thought even for a second,
that you could defeat me is...

273
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,580
...an unbearable humiliation to me!

274
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,540
Listen.

275
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,780
I'm a descendent of the noblest
bloodlines in the world...

276
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,220
The Celestial Dragon!

277
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,570
What?!

278
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,140
We're admirable just by
the fact of our birth.

279
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,010
I used to possess the most
unobtainable power in the world.

280
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,940
However,

281
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,420
one day, my father abandoned
the greatest power

282
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,680
in the world that we were born with,

283
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,430
and the four of us in the family...

284
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,420
...descended to this manure-pile world!

285
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,920
Screw that "live like human-beings" bull!

286
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,680
My father was an idiotic man!

287
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,890
Let's live a humble life here,
all four of us as a family!

288
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,990
What do you think happened?

289
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,450
Father! Where are the slaves-eh?!
Let's go buy some-eh!

290
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,040
Father, why don't they fall
down on their knees-eh?

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,710
Father! Why do they come after us-eh?!

292
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,220
They're a Celestial Dragon family!

293
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,130
Don't kill them... Make them suffer
for the rest of their lives!

294
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,200
By the age of ten,
I'd seen heaven and hell on earth.

295
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,610
Then, I killed my father
who caused all that

296
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,950
and returned to Mariejois with his head!

297
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,640
But...

298
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,750
...the Celestial Dragons in heaven
would never accept a renegade family!

299
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,660
I knew there was no way
to get out of this hell.

300
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,800
I swore to myself at that moment.

301
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,970
That I will destroy...

302
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,080
...every single thing in the world
that they dominate!

303
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,450
The life I've lived was
on a very different level from yours!

304
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,260
I have no time to play around...

305
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,490
...with you brats!

306
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,230
Facing Doflamingo, possessor of such

307
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,900
great power that he can even move
the World Government to action,

308
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,210
Luffy and Law are left helpless!

309
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,760
When their execution is
finally about to begin,

310
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
the world-shaking, tremendous
secret of the Op-Op Fruit

311
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,350
and Law's shocking past will be revealed!

312
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,720
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,520
"The Ultimate Power! The
Secret of the Op-Op Fruit!"

314
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,860
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
