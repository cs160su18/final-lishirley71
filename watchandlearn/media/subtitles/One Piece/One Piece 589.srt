00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,160
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,290
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,460
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,880
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,340
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,510
Find it!

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,850
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,600
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,010
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,470
we go!

69
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,190
...head for the New World,

71
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,690
the second half of the Grand Line.

72
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

73
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

74
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

75
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,130
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

76
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,340
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

77
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

78
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,770
After surviving a fierce battle,

80
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,520
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,730
the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors.

82
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,820
After receiving an emergency
signal, they landed on Punk Hazard;

83
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,410
an island with two parts,
one burning, the other frozen.

84
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,450
A branch of the Navy - G-5 - led by Smoker

85
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,200
reached the island while
chasing after the Straw Hats

86
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,870
and got into a fight with Trafalgar
Law who appeared out of nowhere.

87
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,540
It's you! Do you remember me?

88
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,920
Thank you for your help the other day!

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,090
Shambles!

90
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,260
What did he just do?

91
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,850
If there is some mastermind behind Law

92
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,480
and if "CC" are his initials,

93
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,270
I think I know who it is.

94
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,200
He is the former colleague of Dr.Vegapunk.

95
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,660
He is a scientist named Caesar Clown!

96
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:37,840
"The Worst in the World!
A Scientist of Terror - Caesar!"

97
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,260
Caesar Clown?

98
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,010
Who is that?

99
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,690
Um, I have something on my mind, too.

100
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,950
If I remember correctly,

101
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,290
there were a lot of child abduction
cases taking place around here recently.

102
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,750
Child abduction?!

103
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,830
That's right.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,010
By the way, I can't get used seeing
you like that, Captain-chan!

105
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,680
It can't be helped!
You have to deal with it for now!

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,350
Hey, Tashigi! What are you talking about?

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,350
I haven't heard about
any child abductions!

108
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,560
Please button up, Smoker-san!

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,270
I like how open that Captain-chan
is but she's scary inside!

110
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,570
Shut up!

111
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,610
All I know is accidents at sea
happen frequently in this area.

112
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,530
But in fact, I was wondering why accidents
involving children are so prevalent here.

113
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,540
Oh yeah, that's true, isn't it?

114
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah!

115
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
I actually go to the
communication department often...

116
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,790
Oh, I don't have glasses...

117
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,250
And I've heard the G-5 gets
many child abduction reports.

118
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,340
But when it appears in the
newspaper, it's often labeled

119
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,340
an accident at sea or the work of pirates...

120
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,220
…or simply a child gone missing.

121
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,980
Of course, it could be the
reporter's mistake but...

122
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,610
I... I thought maybe it's
possible that they were really...

123
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,530
Is it hard to say, Tashigi?

124
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,410
If that's what you think,
just say it clearly!

125
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,210
We saw a bunch of kids earlier

126
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,210
and you're thinking maybe there
really have been many abductions.

127
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,010
And you think the
kidnapper is on this island.

128
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,390
But if that's the case,

129
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,440
those news articles were false...

130
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,740
...meaning somebody in the G-5 covered
up those child abduction cases.

131
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
What?

132
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,950
Does it mean somebody among us
is working for the kidnapper?

133
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,870
Wh...

134
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,750
What?!

135
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,710
Hey, Smo-san, don't insult us!

136
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,420
Maybe we are a spoiled group in the Navy

137
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,430
but we take pride in being Navy soldiers!

138
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,800
He's right! None of us is doing that!

139
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,520
Shut up!

140
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,030
So scary!

141
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,280
You fools are not even worth suspecting!

142
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,360
What?!

143
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,740
But, all of you guys,
don't expect too much from the Navy.

144
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,910
As long as it consists of a group of people,

145
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,540
there is no organization that is perfect.

146
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,500
If you assume too much,
you'll miss the enemy.

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,460
Don't be fooled by appearances.

148
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,890
Roger, Captain-chan!

149
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,440
Never mind, fools.

150
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,480
I-I'm the Captain!

151
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,280
Oh yeah!

152
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
We got fooled by their appearances!

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,870
Smoker-san, I'm not so sure
about my theory though.

154
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,540
That's okay.
We'd better keep it in mind anyway.

155
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,620
But since my heart and
body are in Law's hands,

156
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,380
I can't leave this island.

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,210
One third of you should leave
here by ship, to make a report.

158
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,630
What are you talking about, Vice Admiral?

159
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,430
Our warship's been destroyed.

160
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,810
I said I saw their ship.

161
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,600
Steal it.

162
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,680
Oh yeah! I hadn't thought of that!

163
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
You're a bad person!

164
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,400
Be careful! Before it gets too late,

165
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,730
I'll try to take back my heart and body,

166
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,440
and reveal who's really behind this!

167
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,450
VEGAPUNK'S FORMER THIRD LABORATORY

168
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,540
I finally got through to him.

169
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,120
Clank.

170
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,250
We have permission to kill.

171
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,250
The Straw Hats, G-5, and Foxfire Kin'emon.

172
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,380
No matter who dies on this island,

173
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,130
Joker will make it look
like an accident at sea.

174
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,050
Catch as many of them as possible!

175
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,390
The more guinea pigs, the better.

176
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,520
Yes, Master.

177
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,560
But you can just kill the ones
who can't be taken with poison.

178
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,440
Where did Law go?

179
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,400
He left the room a few minutes ago.

180
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,650
All right.

181
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,030
One of the enemies has a
400 million berry bounty.

182
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,910
Don't push yourself too much.

183
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,830
The other members are in a broad
range of 120 million to 50 berries each.

184
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,910
All of them are wanted pirates

185
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,620
and their bounties are 800
million 50 berries in total.

186
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,290
But they have been inactive
over the past two years

187
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,590
so their bounty hasn't moved up.

188
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,010
They could be more powerful
than the numbers show.

189
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,800
You always study hard, Monet.

190
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,180
Master!

191
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,730
Oh, what happened to you? It's extremely
cold and you didn't wear a coat?!

192
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,810
We were robbed by some pirates.

193
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,320
More importantly, they took
Boss Brownbeard with them!

194
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,820
Please help him!

195
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,280
Oh really? I'm sorry to hear that!

196
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,330
Don't worry about Brownbeard.

197
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,700
We'll get him back at any cost.

198
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,540
Go to the backroom now!

199
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,500
You're so lucky.

200
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,670
We just made a new medicine.

201
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,630
It will warm up your body
and heal your wounds.

202
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,800
Really?! That'd be nice!

203
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,510
Please help the others, too!

204
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,390
Of course, I will.

205
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,680
But first, you have to get treated.

206
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,850
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

207
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,480
What the hell is this, Usopp?!

208
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,150
It's kind of super!

209
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,530
I don't care anymore...

210
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,910
Thanks, Usopp!

211
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,950
It spoils Nami-san's beauty!

212
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,740
Cut the crap!

213
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,620
We get confused if nothing is done.

214
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,210
Brownbeard?

215
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes. I'm sure you heard that name before.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,880
That was what I used to go by.

217
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,010
No idea.

218
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,800
Are you kidding, you fool?

219
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,630
Go away, brats!

220
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,810
What happened to you?
You were clammed up a while ago

221
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,470
but now you're talkative.

222
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,980
You guys are done for!

223
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,440
Law's gonna come to save me!

224
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,610
I despise pirates from your generation

225
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,200
but Law is an exception.

226
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,120
What do you mean our generation?

227
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,450
Don't you know anything, fool?

228
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,870
Eleven rookies with
bounties over 100 million

229
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,500
who arrived at Sabaody at
the same time two years ago

230
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,330
plus Blackbeard...

231
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,550
People call you twelve
"the Worst Generation."

232
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,510
You twelve are troublemakers...

233
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,140
...who were born at the change of the era

234
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,300
and hold the key to the future
of this war-torn world.

235
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,270
After Whitebeard died, you all came
to the New World and raised havoc.

236
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,940
When something big happened,

237
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,230
there was always somebody
from your generation involved.

238
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,740
Blackbeard! Kid! Law! Drake! Hawkins!

239
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,040
Basil Hawkins was the one who
shattered my pirate group.

240
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,500
I lost both of my legs and ended my
career as a pirate thanks to him.

241
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,790
My crew were annihilated.

242
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,800
I fled for my life and arrived here...

243
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,470
...on Punk Hazard.

244
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,260
Do you know what this place is?

245
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,350
This place... This island...

246
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,520
...used to be a lush green
treasure house of life.

247
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,860
Really?

248
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,240
It's nothing like that now.

249
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,300
And it housed a laboratory

250
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,550
of Dr.Vegapunk, a Government scientist.

251
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,140
They were experimenting with and
developing weapons and chemicals here.

252
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,060
Instead of going to prisons,
they brought some prisoners here

253
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,570
and performed experiments on
them like they were guinea pigs.

254
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,150
But four years ago,

255
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,700
Vegapunk's chemical
weapon test went wrong!

256
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,390
And two of the three
laboratories exploded!

257
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,940
This is the remains of that laboratory.

258
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,880
THE REMAINS OF VEGAPUNK'S FORMER
FIRST AND SECOND LABORATORY

259
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,380
I see. So there was a huge explosion.

260
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,260
That's why this place is a mess.

261
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,230
The explosion belched intense
heat and toxic substances,

262
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,690
and killed each and every
living thing on the island.

263
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,710
But in that critical situation,

264
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,170
the Government left those
guinea-pig prisoners

265
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,680
and escaped from the island
then shut it down completely.

266
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,770
The prisoners stayed
in the Third Laboratory,

267
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,350
the only building that remained intact,

268
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,190
and sheltered themselves from the
poison gas that was all over the island.

269
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,030
Even those who survived were
paralyzed mainly in their lower body

270
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,030
because of the nerve gas

271
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,950
and lost hope in their future.

272
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,620
But...

273
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,200
...a year later,

274
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,080
our merciful Master came to the island!

275
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,210
He purified the gas all over the
island with his special ability

276
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,930
and gave those prisoners who couldn't
walk mechanical means to move

277
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,810
and took them on as his lackeys.

278
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,390
Master!

279
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,690
Master!

280
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,020
Master-san!

281
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,530
I landed here a year later after that,

282
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,240
two years ago.

283
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,840
There were still some toxic
substances left in the air

284
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,340
and I felt nauseous when I breathed in.

285
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:19,930
Just when I thought I had no energy
left to live and this was the end...

286
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,730
I saw the prisoners who
lost their legs like I did

287
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,190
and the Master!

288
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,500
His kindness saved my
life as it did to the others.

289
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,920
Vegapunk was a devil because
he paralyzed my comrade's legs

290
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,300
but the Master was our
warm-hearted savior!

291
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,470
Master!!

292
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,140
And then a few months ago,

293
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,020
the second savior--

294
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,060
Trafalgar Law who had
gained the title of Warlord...

295
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,980
...came to the island.

296
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,400
Using his special ability,

297
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,530
he gave those of us who
couldn't walk as we wished, legs.

298
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,240
The legs of living animals!

299
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,790
We thought we would never walk again

300
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,170
so we couldn't stop crying from happiness!

301
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,340
What a touching story!

302
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,220
So the Tra-guy is a good guy as I thought!

303
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,590
He saved my life, too!

304
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,180
Vegapunk is a horrible person!

305
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,430
That's why there were those
half-sheep people at the laboratory.

306
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,600
Centaurs and the bird woman, too.

307
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,150
It all makes sense.

308
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,270
But wait. What about the dragon?

309
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,150
Oh, did you see the dragon?

310
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,820
That's an artificial being that
Vegapunk created to guard the island.

311
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,030
It can adapt itself to
any kind of environment.

312
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,540
I heard some Celestial Dragon
liked it and named it.

313
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,210
I forgot the name but if
you see it, you better run.

314
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,420
It's extremely aggressive.

315
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,590
All right.

316
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,630
We already ate it.

317
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,840
Anyway, now you know who rules the island.

318
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,220
No one wants to come near it.

319
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,930
Punk Hazard is our Master's property now!

320
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,480
Rejoice!

321
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,480
The Master is still doing research
today for the future of mankind!

322
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,900
He needs only a few guinea
pigs and you can become one!

323
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,320
You can't get away!

324
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,550
Hm? What's the matter?

325
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,800
Master!

326
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,510
Master! I can't breathe!

327
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,630
What kind of...

328
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,390
...medicine is this?

329
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,640
Master!

330
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,140
Master...

331
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,520
Get me out of here!

332
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,820
You need to hang on.

333
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,150
How do you feel now?

334
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,080
Feeling nauseous and coughing, huh?

335
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,160
That's good.

336
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,830
Do you have a headache?

337
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,120
It hurts!

338
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,080
Feels like it's gonna split open!

339
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,790
Uh-huh, I see.

340
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,800
What? It wasn't Vegapunk?

341
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,510
Then, Smo-san,

342
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,590
who caused that huge explosion?

343
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,840
The one who made the weapon

344
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,220
and
let it go off accidentally...

345
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,810
...was Caesar Clown!

346
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,190
Caesar Clown was

347
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,980
the second-in-command in the
science department at that time

348
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,280
but since he had an inhumane streak,

349
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,490
he was always butting heads with Vegapunk.

350
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,070
M-Master...

351
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,790
H-Help me...

352
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,130
How are your eyes?

353
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,880
Do you see anything?

354
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,380
Huh?

355
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,220
Oh... there is... a giant snake in the room!

356
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,430
No way!

357
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,180
All right, that's good. Goodbye!

358
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,190
When the accident happened,

359
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,030
Vegapunk's name came up only
because he was a person in charge.

360
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,910
Of course,

361
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,040
it was a crime to develop a mass-killing
weapon that belches poison gas.

362
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,960
And since it had been brought
to light by the accident,

363
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,580
Caesar got arrested.

364
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,590
But with his formidable ability,

365
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,630
he managed to escape from a prison ship

366
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,090
and had been missing ever since.

367
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,220
If Caesar is still doing
research on this island,

368
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,680
we must stop him now!

369
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,810
He's gonna do something horrible again!

370
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,020
"Not good."

371
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,940
Another failure?

372
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,240
Failure?

373
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,660
Watch your tongue!

374
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:41,830
A FORMER GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST
BOUNTY: 300 MILLION BERRIES MASTER CAESAR CLOWN

375
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,410
My experiments never fail!

376
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,910
Even what happened four years ago!

377
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,830
Everyone talks nonsense as usual!

378
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,710
A failed experiment?

379
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,010
I "killed" the whole
island with the weapon!

380
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,760
It wasn't a failure, World Government!

381
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,760
I'm capable of killing more
enemies than anyone else.

382
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,270
I carefully document my
victims until their final moment.

383
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,810
You just wait!

384
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:07,110
I'll make them realize who is the
greatest scientist in the world!

385
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,340
"One Piece," "Toriko," and "Dragon Ball"
have a miraculous collaboration.

386
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,380
The World's Best Eating Competition is
held in search for the legendary ingredient.

387
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,470
With the dream collaboration
between Luffy, Toriko, and Goku,

388
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,810
the crowd's enthusiasm explodes.

389
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,370
But then a mysterious being suddenly appears

390
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,910
and the situation takes an unprecedented turn.

391
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

392
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,690
"History's Strongest Collaboration
vs. Glutton of the Sea"

393
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
