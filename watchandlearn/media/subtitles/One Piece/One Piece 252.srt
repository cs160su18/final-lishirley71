00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,550
So, in short, you're no longer
part of the Straw Hats,

3
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,250
but you still haven't quit being a pirate, huh?

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,050
If you're a pirate, then we'll take you.

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,470
Merry!!

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,100
Let me tell you what I know.

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,770
You don't even know how much the
World Government messed up my life!

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,150
If you hate the Government that much,
then why are you helping them?!

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,740
Because I have a wish I want to come true
even if I have to give up everything.

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,470
The life I once gave up on...

11
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,120
The heart that I lost...

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,380
The dream I could no longer have...

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,340
They picked them all up for me.

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,500
I was able to make friends who
would believe in someone like me.

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,640
Then, your wish is...

16
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,980
That the six Straw Hats, excluding me,
can leave this island safely!

17
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,640
Are you saying, for that, you don't
care if the weapon is brought back?!

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,150
You don't care what happens to the world?!

19
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,570
That's right. I don't!

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,320
Of all people,

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,880
over the lives of everyone in this world,

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,430
she chose the lives of the six of you.

23
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,760
It was for us...

24
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,620
Chopper! Wake up! We have to find everyone!

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,880
Chopper! Hey, wake up!

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,720
Hey, hey, he's really
seriously injured, you know...

27
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,960
Well, CP9 is coming soon.

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,390
Nico Robin, go on ahead
and get on board. Now!

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,930
Hey, you two! Hurry up and take her away!

30
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,010
Yes, sir!

31
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,390
A government official, marines...
and Robin-chan...

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,400
Now... how should I play it?

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,860
I carry a darkness within me
that you guys don't know about.

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,320
No matter how you look at it, it looks
as if she's being taking in by the authority.

35
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,680
If she wants to run,

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,790
she should be able to bring
down all those guys by herself.

37
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,590
Does she have her own purpose?

38
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,170
Oh, is there a reason that she can't run?

39
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,940
Sorry to keep you waiting, Robin-chan!

40
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,060
Oh, I've been waiting for you, my prince!

41
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,980
Is she doing it on purpose because
she wants me to rescue her after all?

42
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,380
Corgy-san!

43
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,020
CP9 is here!

44
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,960
Hm?

45
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,040
--You bastard! Let me go!
--I said let me go!!

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,570
--How many times do I have to tell you?!
--I'm saying you guys're scary!
--Whoa... That's Rob Lucci-san.

47
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,840
How intimidating...

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,830
So, they're CP9...

49
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,650
How many times do I have to tell you?!

50
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,240
--You guys're scary!
--Let me go, you bastard!

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,610
Let me go!

52
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:24,110
Hey! Where are you taking me?!
You guys're not gonna get away with this!

53
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,840
Just wait and see! I've got eight
thousand men under me and...

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,380
Usopp...!

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

56
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,710
with the sun always in our hearts

57
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

58
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,680
let's grab hold of our wishes

59
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:05,780
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

60
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,960
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

62
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:27,050
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

63
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,670
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

64
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

65
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,440
And if you get into a jam

66
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
I'll always be there to protect you

67
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,690
It's all right! Now let's move forward

68
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,200
with the sun always in our hearts

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,460
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

70
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,710
and gaze at the light beyond

71
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,420
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

72
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

73
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,140
So let's grab hold of our wishes

74
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,580
under the same flag-- together, we're one

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,060
One Piece

76
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:31,080
"The Steam Whistle Forces Friends Apart!
The Sea Train Starts to Run"

77
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,250
Hey! Where are you taking me?!
You guys're not gonna get away with this!

78
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,550
Just wait and see! I've got eight
thousand men under me and...

79
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,210
Usopp...!

80
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,180
Good work on your
long-term mission, sirs and madam!

81
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,040
Lucci-san, here is your coat.

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,120
This looks pompous.

83
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,440
Stop it.

84
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,150
Yes, sir. R-Right away!

85
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,160
This isn't a game. Stay focused!

86
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,780
Everyone, get on the train!

87
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,080
Everyone, get on the sea train!
Get ready to leave for Enies Lobby!

88
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I said let me go!

89
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,830
Who the hell are they?

90
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,050
In any case...

91
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,560
"Sorry to cause you trouble until the end"?

92
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,010
Is he trying to cause us trouble
even after he left the group?

93
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,950
A little further to the right! Spray water there!

94
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,480
Run more water!

95
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,010
A little bit longer...

96
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,340
We're okay here! Go help treat the injured!

97
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,360
Okay, got it!

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,400
Is there anyone left inside?!

99
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Watch your step over there!

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,200
Then, it's not that Robin doesn't like us?!

101
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,530
That's right!

102
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,490
I'm so glad!

103
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,320
What?! He turned into a raccoon dog!

104
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,950
He turned into a raccoon dog!

105
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,120
Hey, he turned into a raccoon dog!

106
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,190
So, Chopper, we have to find
Luffy and the others right away

107
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,630
and go rescue Robin!

108
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,280
Okay! Let's go find them!

109
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,470
Where are they?

110
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,880
I don't know. That's why
we're going to look for them.

111
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,540
All right...! I'll do my best!

112
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,430
Whoa! He turned into a gorilla!

113
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,690
You guys, wait.

114
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,590
I don't care if you go after Nico Robin.

115
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,620
But the sea train for government
personnel will depart at 11 tonight.

116
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,810
Well... this is just my guess,

117
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,040
but it's highly possible
that they'll take that train.

118
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,750
In other words, Nico Robin will, too.

119
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,740
What?

120
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,030
After that train, the sea train will
be suspended for the time being,

121
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,740
since Aqua Laguna is coming soon.

122
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,630
Then... that means...

123
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,170
Yeah...

124
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,240
If you miss that train,
you can't sail out, of course,

125
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,600
which means there's no
means to leave this island.

126
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,350
Oh, no! This is bad! What time is it now?!

127
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,500
--10:30.
--What?! We've only got 30 minutes left!

128
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,830
Hey, can't you do something?
Stop the sea train for a while.

129
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,820
Well... Its destination, Enies Lobby,

130
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,320
is an island off-limits to those
other than Government personnel.

131
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,450
The engine driver is also from the
Government. He won't listen to me.

132
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,180
Oh, no...!

133
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,860
Then... the only way left is
for me to go to the station

134
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,890
and somehow persuade Robin directly...

135
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,340
--Chopper!
--Hm?

136
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
I'll tell you the directions in which Luffy
and Zoro flew, so search those areas!

137
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,230
If you find them, tell them to
come to the station immediately.

138
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,890
Okay. Got it.

139
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,880
Hey... guys...!

140
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,310
Ah! Paulie-san! You're okay!

141
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,520
Give this girl and her friend a hand.

142
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,810
What?!

143
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,360
G-Give them a hand, you said, Paulie?!

144
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,720
They're the culprits who
tried to kill Iceberg-san!

145
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,440
We should restrain these two!

146
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,700
Lucci-san and Kaku-san are still missing and...

147
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,480
The assassination culprits
are not the Straw Hats!

148
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,790
They're innocent!

149
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,750
We were tricked by the real culprits,
and so we falsely accused them!

150
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,570
--What...?
--I don't know the true
identity of those masked men,

151
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,220
but the Straw Hats fought against them for us!

152
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,180
As a matter of fact, Iceberg-san and I
are still alive because of them, right?

153
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,100
You don't have to look for Lucci and Kaku.

154
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,610
We may not see them again.

155
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,120
What?! You know what happened to them?!

156
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,530
They're visiting their hometowns.

157
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,060
That can't be!
Why, during an emergency like this?!

158
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,410
Just go find the Straw Hat!

159
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,200
Hey, you, shameless girl!

160
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,090
That again... Hey, stop calling me that!

161
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,470
You're going to the station, right?
I'll show you the way.

162
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,880
Yeah... Thanks...

163
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,820
Paulie-san! Hey!

164
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,380
Is what you just told us true?!

165
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,560
Quit your jabbering and help them already!

166
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,620
Are you trying to hurt Galley-La's name?!

167
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,390
N-No, foreman!

168
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,560
We apologize!

169
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,910
We're sorry!

170
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,850
Tell us what to do! We'll help you guys!

171
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,110
Bring Yagaras out! Open the cage!

172
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,770
Yeah!

173
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,650
Visiting their hometowns, huh?

174
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,570
It's probably not good to
give them all the details.

175
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,910
We don't have to make them
feel the pain we felt, right?

176
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,570
Chopper! I'm counting on you!

177
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,400
Yep! I'll be sure to bring them!

178
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,930
Hello! Guys!

179
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,280
Hello!

180
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,870
Hello! Luffy!

181
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,680
Zoro! Sanji!

182
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,980
Usopp, come back to us.

183
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,570
Everyone, please shout with me!

184
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,020
Okay, got it! Guys! Got that?!

185
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,440
Yeah!

186
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,220
Hello! Luffy!

187
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,990
Zoro!

188
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,530
Sanji!

189
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,410
Usopp, come back to us.

190
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,990
Turn into that canal!
That's a shortcut to the station!

191
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,560
We still have twenty minutes
before the train departs.

192
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,080
Don't go, Robin.

193
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,940
To think that you're sacrificing yourself...

194
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,520
We're never gonna let that happen!

195
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,580
Yagara-chan! Please! Go faster!

196
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,330
The last departure at 11 PM...

197
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,670
...from Blue Station,
Water Seven, to Enies Lobby...

198
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,240
--Ouch!
--Ow!

199
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,140
Stay here quietly.

200
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,450
You bastards! Treat us more nicely, you idiots!

201
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,820
He's right, you idiots!

202
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,600
You damn Government dumbasses!

203
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,270
Hm? Well, that's...

204
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,770
Due to the approaching storm surge,

205
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,490
the departure time has been moved
up and the train will leave soon.

206
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,410
Dammit! It's already leaving?

207
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,870
Our mission is mostly completed, huh?

208
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,130
Restrain yourself from making such a
frivolous comment until we get there.

209
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,420
Idiot.

210
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,670
Pardon me.

211
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,850
If you miss that train,
there's no means to leave this island.

212
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,470
Please! Let me make it in time!

213
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,240
Franky... Are you safe?

214
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,440
Straw Hat!

215
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,530
Roronoa!

216
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,160
Luffy!

217
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,760
Where are you?!

218
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,190
Hello! Where are you?!

219
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,180
Please come out!

220
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,570
Zoro! Sanji!

221
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,940
Usopp, come back to us.

222
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,610
Luffy! They're gonna take Robin away!

223
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,240
Answer me! Where are you?!

224
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,110
I wonder what actions
Luffy and the others took...

225
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,670
Looks like no one will make it here in time.

226
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,970
I repeat. The last train will depart soon.

227
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,200
Dammit! Th-Those bastards!

228
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,940
They're never gonna get away with this!

229
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,320
I got stuck...

230
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,640
It was a tragedy that I slipped.

231
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,330
Dammit!

232
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,030
I got stuck...

233
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,590
Luffy! Zoro!

234
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,550
Sanji! Come out!

235
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,160
Let's go rescue Robin!

236
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,520
Straw Hat!

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,490
Roronoa!

238
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,240
Where are you guys?

239
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,980
What about this way?!

240
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,420
Hello!

241
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,050
Straw Hat!

242
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,990
Zoro!

243
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,180
We still can't find them here.

244
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,250
Couldn't they be in one of the backstreets?

245
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,210
If that's the case, the area
might already be flooded.

246
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,370
It'd be dangerous to go
there to look for them, too.

247
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,630
Dammit! Straw Hat! Roronoa!

248
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,650
Lucci-san! Since the waves
are getting quite high,

249
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,820
we're departing a bit early.

250
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,830
--Could it cause you any trou--
--No. Depart.

251
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,950
Coo coo!

252
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,450
Yes, sir. Well, then...

253
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,170
Although I lived on this island for five years...

254
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,410
...I don't even feel like it's hard
to say goodbye to this place.

255
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,500
Hey! Did you just hear a steam whistle?!

256
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,230
Yeah. But it's strange.
It's not the departure time yet.

257
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,950
But there are no public passengers.

258
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,160
It's possible that they'd leave
earlier due to the weather!

259
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,750
Hurry up! We can now see
the station in front of us!

260
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,120
Please stop! Sea train!

261
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,090
Today's last departure

262
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,730
from Blue Station,
Water Seven, to Enies Lobby...

263
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,590
The train's leaving. Be seated.

264
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,930
...is now departing.

265
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,660
I no longer have a reason to live!

266
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,950
Leave me here!

267
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,780
Why do I have to listen to you?

268
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,070
You made me live then when I wanted to die.

269
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,540
That's your crime.

270
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,230
There's no place for me to go or go back to.

271
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,050
So let me stay on this ship.

272
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,160
Oh, I see... Then I guess
we have no choice... Okay.

273
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,470
Luffy!

274
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,640
Don't worry. She isn't a bad person.

275
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,150
It couldn't be...!
Could the Rio Poneglyph be...?!

276
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,810
Which means I, too,

277
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:48,340
have to guide the text on those
Poneglyphs that I read in the past...

278
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,370
...to the end of the Grand Line... to Raftel...

279
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,020
Robin!

280
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,650
Robin! How are you feeling?

281
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,090
I-It started moving.

282
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,460
Dammit! Those damn officials!

283
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,470
We're here! Thanks, Yagara-chan!

284
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,510
Go down the stairs
through the middle entrance!

285
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,430
Got it!

286
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,890
Robin! Don't go!

287
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,090
Hey, you! Who are you?!

288
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,700
It's dangerous! Stay back!

289
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,670
Robin! Get off the train! We'll fight
for you no matter who we're up against!

290
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,060
Luffy!

291
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,730
Zoro!

292
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,300
Where are you guys?!

293
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,300
I can't get out...!

294
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,850
Wait!

295
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,190
The train...!

296
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,440
Wait!

297
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,740
Robin!

298
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:02,970
Robin!!

299
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,410
We had a dream that day

300
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,200
Our belief in ourselves

301
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:47,250
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

302
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:56,760
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

303
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:06,980
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

304
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:15,530
In the end, we can all surely smile

305
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,270
What's this letter? No way!
Sanji-kun is on the sea train?!

306
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,950
Then Sanji is with Robin right now?

307
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,640
Yeah. We have to hurry up
and go to Enies Lobby, too.

308
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,260
Where did Luffy and Zoro go?

309
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,730
We can't do anything without those two.
We must find them! We must!

310
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

311
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,150
"Sanji Barges In! Sea Train Battle in the Storm!"

312
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
