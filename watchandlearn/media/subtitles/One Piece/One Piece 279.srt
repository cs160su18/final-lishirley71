2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,030
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,820
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,390
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,580
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,100
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,450
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,700
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,470
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:24,590
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,220
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,980
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,820
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,980
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,880
We are!

24
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,940
Sogeking.

25
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,010
Hm?

26
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,770
Shoot through that flag.

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,360
Roger.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Huh?

29
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,620
This is my new weapon,
a huge slingshot... named Kabuto!

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,570
Have a good look at its power!

31
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,000
Special Attack... Firebird Star!

32
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,170
Oh, no...!

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Mission accomplished.

34
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,190
Are you insane?! Don't think
that you'll be able to survive

35
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,020
after making the entire world your enemy!

36
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,900
Bring it on!

37
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,920
Robin!

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,200
We still haven't heard you say it!

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,240
Say you want to live!

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,810
Robin...

41
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,410
Robin!

42
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,000
To live...

43
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,560
I thought it was something I dared not wish for.

44
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,470
No one ever let me wish for it.

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,870
The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...

46
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,900
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!

47
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,750
If... it's really okay for me
to utter my wish for once...

48
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,310
I...

49
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,030
I want to live!

50
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,520
Take me to the sea with you!

51
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,820
You guys...! I love you guys, dammit!

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,660
Let's go!

53
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,010
The drawbridge is coming down!

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,050
Looks like they pulled through. Good timing.

55
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,480
Robin!

56
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,920
We're gonna rescue you for sure!

57
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,810
The drawbridge is coming down! Go! Straw Hat!

58
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,820
How dare those damn pirates?!

59
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,950
We're not gonna let it happen!

60
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,620
Get the trench mortar ready!
Stop the drawbridge! Break it if you have to!

61
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,660
Yes, sir!

62
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,570
The drawbridge stopped coming down?!

63
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,460
How dare they get in our way?! Damn bastards!

64
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,220
Who's doing this?!

65
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,500
Hey, pirates!

66
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,310
What?! Kokoro-san?!

67
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,980
I heard everything!
What're you guys wasting time for?!

68
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,990
Wasting time? But the
bridge is only halfway down.

69
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,600
Jump with all your might towards the falls!

70
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,050
The sound of the sea train?

71
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,740
Huh? What's the meaning of that smile?

72
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,540
Here we go!

73
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,580
I knew it!

74
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,490
Nooo!

75
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,680
I wasn't gonna take you anyway!

76
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,390
You'll never be a pirate!

77
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,840
I will too!

78
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,020
Someday, I'm gonna gather a
crew every bit as good as yours,

79
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,480
and I'm gonna find the
greatest treasure in the world,

80
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,120
and I'm gonna be King of
the Pirates! I'll show you!

81
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,570
When I was a kid, I swore that I'd
gather a crew and become a pirate...

82
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,710
...like the pirate who protected me.

83
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,710
You're already one of my crew.

84
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,980
Robin...

85
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,550
Just like the pirate who protected me,

86
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,180
I'll protect you, too!

87
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,400
"Jump Towards the Falls! Luffy's Feelings!!"

88
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,880
Then take me on your next voyage, Shanks!

89
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,840
I wanna be a pirate too!

90
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,620
As if you could ever be a pirate!

91
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,600
Why not?!

92
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,020
Luffy. Just bein' a good swimmer
doesn't mean you'd make a good pirate.

93
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,470
I'm good at fighting too!
My punches are like pistols!

94
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,020
Oh, really?

95
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,430
What's that mean?!

96
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,440
He means you're too much of a kid, Luffy!

97
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,890
Seriously, you're as old as my own kid!

98
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,410
I'm not a kid! I'm a grownup!

99
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,830
Now, now. Don't get so mad.
Here! Have some juice!

100
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,700
Wow! Thanks!

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,290
See, you are a kid! Ha!

102
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,980
That wasn't fair, Shanks!

103
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,080
Don't laugh!

104
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,880
Stupid cheapskate Shanks!

105
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,600
Pardon us.

106
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,470
Oh... So these are "pirates."
Look pretty damn dumb.

107
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,720
Welcome...

108
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,710
We're mountain bandits. But we
ain't here to tear up the place.

109
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,010
Sell us some booze. Ten barrels oughta do.

110
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,010
I'm sorry. I just ran out of alcohol.

111
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,550
That's odd.

112
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,390
These pirates seem to be drinking
something... What is it, water?

113
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,510
No, what they're drinking is the last of it.

114
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,720
My apologies. Looks like we
drank the whole place dry.

115
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,680
Sorry!

116
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,950
You can have this, if you'd like.
It hasn't been opened yet.

117
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,200
There's an eight-million-Berry
bounty on my head, you know.

118
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,150
One bottle ain't even enough for
a bedtime drink! Don't insult me!

119
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,420
Now the floor's all wet.

120
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,840
Sorry about that, Makino-san.
Do you have a rag?

121
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,290
Oh, I'll do that!

122
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,150
Seems you like to clean. Then maybe
you'll find this more fulfilling.

123
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,250
Not worth our time if they're
out of booze. Let's go!

124
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,560
Later, wimps!

125
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you all right, Captain? Are you hurt?!

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Oh, I'm fine. No problem at all.

127
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,010
He got you good, boss!

128
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,430
Talk about lame!

129
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,010
Why are you laughing?!

130
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,310
That was so uncool!
Why didn't you fight them?!

131
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,280
No matter how many there are
or how strong they seem,

132
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,940
you're not men--or pirates--if you
laugh after something like that!

133
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
I can understand how you feel,
but he only spilled some booze on me.

134
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
It's nothing worth getting mad over.

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,080
Whatever!

136
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
Eating out of frustration, Luffy?

137
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,380
Shut up!

138
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,510
Wait, what're you eating?!

139
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,140
That box! Did you eat what was in that box?!

140
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,880
Y-Yeah...

141
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,770
Spit it out! Right now! Every last bite!

142
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,060
W-What're you doing, Shanks?!

143
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,740
What... was that?

144
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,790
What you ate was the Gum-Gum Fruit!

145
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,420
The Gum-Gum Fruit is known as a Devil Fruit!

146
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,420
Eating it turns your body to rubber,

147
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,320
and makes you lose the ability
to swim for the rest of your life!

148
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,930
Eh?! No way!

149
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,800
You dumbass!

150
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,110
What's the idea, boy? People were
drinkin' and havin' a nice time.

151
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,530
Dammit! Apologize! How dare you
make fun of Shanks and his crew?!

152
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,140
Did I say something to offend you?

153
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,880
You did! Now apologize!

154
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,330
Mayor!

155
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,220
You see the looks on those pirates' faces?!

156
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,670
He got covered in booze, but didn't
say a word! Talk about pathetic!

157
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,220
Pirates are just a bunch of wimps.
They're nothing but talk.

158
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,520
Stop it!

159
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,820
Stop making fun of Shanks and
the others! They are not wimps!

160
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,190
Stop, Luffy!

161
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,990
Stop making fun of Shanks and
the others! You stupid bandits!

162
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,910
You oughta watch your mouth, boy.

163
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,120
No one who's ever made me
mad has lived to tell the tale.

164
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,210
Wait!

165
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,660
Let the boy go! Please!

166
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,350
I don't know what Luffy has done,
nor do I intend to fight with you!

167
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,640
If you're not offended, I'll even pay you!

168
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,340
Just, please! Spare the boy's life!

169
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,840
Mayor!

170
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,020
Leave it to senior citizens
to know how the world works.

171
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,860
But no, it's too late for him now.

172
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,780
After all, he's made me angry...

173
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,020
You're the bad guys! You mountain apes!

174
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,960
You're a lost cause, kid. You can
regret all this in the next life!

175
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,770
--Luffy!
--Please! Let him go!

176
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,670
I was wondering why the bar was empty...

177
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,460
Looks like it's those
mountain bandits from before.

178
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,670
Captain!

179
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,510
Shanks!

180
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,790
So you pirates are still here, huh?

181
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,040
Have you been scrubbing the
village clean this whole time?

182
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
Luffy!

183
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,200
I thought your punches
were as strong as pistols?

184
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,380
S-Shut up!

185
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,090
I dunno why you're here, but you'd
best leave before you get hurt.

186
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,310
Any closer and he'll shoot your head off, wimp.

187
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,810
He said no closer!
Don't make me blow your head off!

188
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,620
Put your life on the line.

189
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,600
Huh?!

190
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,320
Now that you've drawn your pistol,
put your life on the line.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,580
What the hell're you talkin' about?

192
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,030
I'm saying those aren't for threatening people.

193
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,940
N-Now you've done it!

194
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,350
These bastards fight dirty!

195
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,560
--Dirty?
--Cut the crap.

196
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,060
What, do you think you're
dealing with saints or something?

197
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,730
You're looking at pirates!

198
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,930
Shut up! You got nothin' to
do with this in the first place!

199
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,930
Listen, bandits.

200
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,490
Whether I'm splattered with
alcohol or food or even spit on,

201
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,000
most of the time I'd just
laugh and forget about it.

202
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,950
But...!

203
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,080
No matter what the reason,

204
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,240
anyone who hurts my friends has to pay!

205
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,700
Shanks...

206
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,330
Has to pay, huh?!

207
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,500
Lousy pirates! Kill 'em, men!

208
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,970
I'll handle this. Should be easy enough.

209
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,650
Don't get cocky, bandit.

210
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:06,010
If you wanna fight us, then go
drag a warship here or somethin'.

211
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,530
So strong!

212
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,920
H-Hold on! The kid attacked us!

213
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,500
You are a wanted man.

214
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,230
Damn it!

215
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,120
A smokescreen!

216
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,540
Luffy!

217
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,300
I made a clean getaway!

218
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,500
They'll never expect a mountain
bandit to escape onto the sea!

219
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,510
Dammit! Let me go,
you stupid ape! I hope you die!

220
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,680
You wish! You're the one who's gonna die!

221
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,640
After all, you've made me mad!

222
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,150
So long!

223
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,570
Dammit! Dammit!

224
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,350
Those guys are scum, but I couldn't
even hit them once! Dammit!

225
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,430
Sorry! I got no use for you anymore!

226
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,580
W-What the hell?!

227
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,540
Help...!

228
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,540
Shanks!

229
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,870
Get lost!

230
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,570
I'm in your debt, Luffy...
Makino-san told me everything.

231
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,820
You fought for us.

232
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,910
Hey, don't cry! You're a man!

233
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,100
But... Shanks...!

234
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,120
Your arm!

235
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,870
It's only an arm. It's no big deal.

236
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,240
I'm just glad you're alright...

237
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,610
You're leaving, then?

238
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,960
Yeah. It was a long stay, but now we part ways.

239
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,110
Bet you'll miss me, huh?

240
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,330
Well, yeah, but I won't
ask you to take me anymore.

241
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,280
I've decided to become
a pirate on my own now!

242
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,140
I wasn't gonna take you anyway!

243
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,340
You'll never be a pirate!

244
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,580
I will too!

245
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,540
Someday, I'm gonna gather a
crew every bit as good as yours,

246
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,020
and I'm gonna find the
greatest treasure in the world,

247
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,490
and I'm gonna be King of
the Pirates! I'll show you!

248
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,440
You're gonna surpass us, huh?

249
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,310
In that case...

250
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,790
...I'll leave this hat with you.

251
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,910
It's dear to me.

252
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,870
Take good care of it!

253
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,360
Ten years later,

254
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,840
I sailed out and became a pirate.

255
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Just like Shanks protected me,
I'll protect my friends!

256
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,160
Nooo!

257
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,430
Just wait, Robin!

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,470
"Straw Hat Theater"

259
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,890
"Part 1"

260
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,960
That bastard...!

261
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,970
"Usodaba Gang's base of evil"

262
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,020
That detestable Chopper Man!

263
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,300
I'm not gonna let him thwart my plans
to take over the world anymore!

264
00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:03,800
"Evil Incarnate, Usodaba"

265
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,240
This is Dr. Usodaba, evil incarnate!

266
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,820
He leads the evil Usodaba Gang
and schemes to take over the world!

267
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,080
He's an evil scientist who produces evil
phantoms, monsters, robots--anything!

268
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,780
Those are some of his underlings behind him.

269
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,040
I'll lure him out to my base and
wait for him here, ready to strike.

270
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,300
And then, I'll crush him with
my gang's full fighting power!

271
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,880
Swoosh!

272
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,490
His weakness is...

273
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,430
That's right, his assistant, Namifia!

274
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,890
"Pretty Assistant, Namifia"

275
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,050
This is Namifia, a pretty assistant!

276
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,890
She efficiently manages
Chopper Man's missions.

277
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,680
Now, men, go!

278
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,100
First, bring me a hostage!

279
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,540
Dabada!

280
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,520
We brought one!

281
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,270
--'Sup!
--Hey, you brought him?!

282
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:38,670
"Champion of Justice, Chopper Man"

283
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,190
This is Chopper Man, our hero
and champion of justice!

284
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,670
He flies around using his Chopper
cape and fights for world peace!

285
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,790
His weapon is his cuteness!

286
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:48,750
"Cute Spark!!"

287
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,660
With his killer "Cute Spark,"
he can make any enemy's heart melt.

288
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,750
If that doesn't work, he uses "Chopper
Violence" to beat the crap out of them!

289
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,260
I want tea.

290
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,490
Hey, what's the big deal, relaxing at my base?!

291
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,090
Hm?! What's that big thing in the garden?!

292
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,870
It's my secret weapon!
Stop checking it out, you jerk!

293
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,580
Can I try riding on you?

294
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,550
Sure, go ahead.

295
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,890
Hey! Why are you making
friends with him, Luffybomber?!

296
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:17,850
"Secret Weapon, Giant Robot,
Giant Luffybomber"

297
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,400
This is Giant Luffybomber, a giant
robot and their secret weapon.

298
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,560
It's a giant robot that's fifty meters tall.

299
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,030
When Usodaba comes on board,
it becomes your worst, strongest enemy.

300
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,820
Special traits: It can speak.

301
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,860
Personality: It does its own thing!

302
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,670
"Rice Ball Monster, Zorokiller"

303
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,710
This is the rice ball monster, Zorokiller!

304
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,750
When he demands rice balls,
if you don't have any,

305
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,670
he gets angry and says, "Make sure
you have some from now on!"

306
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,640
"Flower Monster, Robiflowern"

307
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,380
This is the flower monster,
Robiflowern. She's an evil woman

308
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,630
who's been defeated by Chopper Man's
killer "Cute Spark" time after time.

309
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:48,100
"Naughty Monster, Sanjiropus"

310
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,310
This is the naughty monster, Sanjiropus.

311
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,480
He insists that he isn't naughty, but he's
always thinking about naughty stuff.

312
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,100
He shows no mercy to guys.

313
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,550
"The Usodaba Gang's Evil Three"

314
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,880
They are the Usodaba Gang's Evil Three.

315
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,560
They have nothing to do
with this story, though...

316
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,370
Thus, the evil gang has been wiped out.

317
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,820
Whoa! Amazing!

318
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,600
You're cool, Luffybomber!

319
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,610
Darn straight I am!

320
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,900
Chopper Man! There's trouble
in one of the eastern towns!

321

Okay! I'll head there in Luffybomber,
the giant robot I obtained the other day!

322
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,540

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,100

327
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,020
I-I'm just trembling with anticipation!

328
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,900
Yeah? Well then, let's hurry up and take
care of these World Government guys!

329
