00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,150
Cradle setup confirmed!

20
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,550
Barco-hunter joint... completed!

21
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,450
Who the hell is invading my turf?!

22
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,100
Hm? Oh, it's a monkey.

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,690
What's this?! What is this thing?!

24
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,880
"Monsters Appear! Don't Mess
with the Whitebeard Pirates!"

25
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,370
Boss!! Boss!!

26
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,860
What is this?!

27
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,510
What is it?! What?! A continent?!

28
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,510
I don't know! I don't know!
I can't see anything!

29
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,040
I can't see anything! This is a dream!

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,520
A dream?! Really?!

31
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,340
Phew, it's just a dream...

32
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,620
Oh?

33
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,680
Were they all...

34
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,370
...eaten along with the ship?

35
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,690
Ahh! You don't have to spell it out!

36
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,490
There's no doubt about it; the air
supply hoses are going into its mouth.

37
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,490
Stop... saying... that...

38
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,090
Luffy and the others were really eaten!!

39
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,930
It was you who made them go
to the Grand Line's seabed!

40
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,260
You said it'd be okay even though you really
didn't have any idea, that's why they...!

41
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,510
You're right.

42
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,150
I'm sorry!

43
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,100
You've got the right idea, but...

44
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,160
Unless we cut the hoses,

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,120
we'll be dragged into the depths
of the ocean with the ship.

46
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,930
No!!

47
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,090
Robin! You're strong,
aren't you?! Do something!

48
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,090
I can't. That thing is too big.

49
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,980
Okay, you guys, pull those
ropes and save our boss!

50
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,120
Show your pride and honor as Masira Pirates!!

51
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,980
Ooh, ooh, aah!

52
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,690
Our boss is still alive!

53
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,650
That's right! Our unity is
tested at a time like this!

54
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,830
Usopp!

55
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,600
Yeah!

56
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,030
Cut the hoses to ensure our safety!

57
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,440
Are you a devil?

58
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,620
She's a devil!

59
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,670
What?! What's going on?!

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,130
It became night?!

61
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,390
Can't be! It's not that late yet!

62
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,140
Then, what's going on?! Luffy!! Zoro!! Sanji!!

63
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,660
How ominous...! This sudden night
is a sign that monsters will appear!

64
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,560
They'll sink our ship!
Hurry up and save our boss!

65
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,440
Luffy!!

66
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,700
Luffy! What happened?! Are you dead?!

67
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,930
Zoro! Sanji!

68
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,050
Set sail! Hurry up and get out of here!

69
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,380
He's crazy...

70
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm glad you were safe! Yeah, let's
get away from that turtle anyway!

71
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Turtle? No, there was a monkey in the sea!

72
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,910
He must be one of the sea animals.

73
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,790
He was getting along with Luffy for a while.

74
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,330
Since they're both monkeys.

75
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,000
But when he saw this stuff
that we got from the ship,

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,700
he suddenly started going on a rampage.

77
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,510
He went on a rampage like a gorilla!

78
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,680
His name's Masira, he's a salvager.

79
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,710
But it's amazing that you guys could
escape from that turtle's mouth!

80
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,470
Turtle? What turtle?

81
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,380
Hm? Something's wrong with the turtle.

82
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,290
His mouth's staying open...
Oh, that's why you could escape!

83
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,060
Whoa!! What the hell is that?!

84
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,250
Hey! Get a clue!!
That thing ate you and the ship!

85
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,660
Hm? Why's it nighttime?

86
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,760
Luffy! Give me a hand! We're gonna set sail!

87
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,040
Hold it!

88
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,240
You punks!

89
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,600
Don't think you can get away after
stealing treasure from my turf!

90
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,350
Treasure?! There was treasure?!

91
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,570
Yeah, there was a lot.

92
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,740
Crap! If that guy goes on
a rampage on the ship...!

93
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,340
B-Boss...! Behind you!

94
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,520
Hm? What is it?!

95
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,440
Monsters!!

96
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,790
No way...

97
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,740
No way can someone be that big...

98
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,810
Man, the Grand Line is just
one mystery after another!

99
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,780
Today, too.

100
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,410
We saw a huge galleon fall from the sky.

101
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,870
The needle of the Log Pose
is now pointing to the sky.

102
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,320
A weird monkey appeared
and salvaged the ship.

103
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,790
Then, we saw a huge turtle
that ate the whole ship.

104
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,470
Then night came.

105
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,090
And, at the end, we saw huge monsters who
were dozens of times larger than the Giants!

106
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,010
Yeah, those guys scared even me.

107
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,890
Huh?

108
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,930
Beat it!

109
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,070
In any case, those monsters were huge.

110
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,850
Yeah... I don't ever wanna see them again.

111
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,110
You know, Chopper...

112
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,390
Hm?

113
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,240
If I went all out, I would've
been able to beat them.

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,350
Really?!

115
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,680
I've beaten ten of them before.

116
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,810
Ten of them?!

117
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,240
What on earth did you guys
go into the water for?

118
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,080
This stuff is all junk, and I don't see
any clues on how to get to the sky!

119
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,840
Like I said, there was nothing!

120
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,370
Well... that's the truth, Nami-san.

121
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,400
It was clear that the ship
had already been plundered.

122
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,800
Or perhaps that there was some sort of mutiny,

123
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,730
and they killed each other.

124
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,170
Then, all the more reason
that we need information!

125
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,760
You see, if we are to go to the sky,

126
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,060
that means what happened to
that ship could happen to us!

127
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,810
We need information to stay alive,
and what'd you get?!

128
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,250
Rusty swords, dishes, and a live octopus?!

129
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,440
We need stuff like a "journal" or a "sea chart"!

130
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,710
What's that, Luffy?

131
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,560
Armor.

132
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,670
Whoa! She crushed the armor!

133
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,900
I got pretty seashells for you, Nami-san!

134
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,830
I don't need them, you big dummy!

135
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,860
Nami-san's cute when she's mad, too!

136
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,620
You'd better keep your
distance from her right now.

137
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,370
Having a tough time?

138
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,590
It's only gonna get worse!
Really, they're all a bunch of idiots!

139
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,600
Now we can't get to our destination!

140
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,310
Here...

141
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,110
What?! An Eternal Pose... This...

142
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,040
I took it from those monkey
people's ship earlier... just in case.

143
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,490
You're the only one on my side!

144
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,400
Hey, we've got an octopus!
Let's make some takoyaki!

145
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,540
It must be quite tough for you.

146
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,200
Jaya...

147
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,640
It must be their headquarters.

148
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,330
Jaya? Are we going there?

149
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,480
That's your decision, you idiot!

150
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,860
Alright! Jaya rudder full!

151
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,470
Jaya rudder full!

152
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,890
Nami, which direction would that be?

153
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,180
Starboard!

154
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,560
Chopper, give me a hand!

155
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,400
Okay!

156
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,510
Jaya speed ahead!

157
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,770
Hey, hold on a second...

158
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,570
If we go to that Jaya place,

159
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,460
won't the log be updated there again?

160
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,140
In other words...

161
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,150
...we won't be able to go to the sky island.

162
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,280
What?!

163
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,010
Stop Jaya rudder!

164
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,510
Hey, Nami! What's the deal?!

165
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,520
What?! You're the one
who decided to go to Jaya.

166
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,970
Oh, yeah...

167
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,110
But I didn't think this'd happen!

168
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,520
It's your fault that you didn't think of it!

169
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,620
The Log Pose has always
worked like this, right?!

170
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,870
Oh, yeah... Hey, listen up!

171
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,800
Since I'm the captain,
I'll decide where we're going!

172
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,740
I wanna go to the sky island!

173
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,490
Okay, but how?

174
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,740
We're best off asking someone.

175
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,880
eah, let's ask in Jaya.

176
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,190
Then, we should go to Jaya.

177
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,530
Alright, then! Jaya rudder full!

178
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,080
Wait! You're going in circles!

179
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,790
It's not as if a log can be
stored as soon as we get there.

180
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,060
So why don't we go to Jaya and leave
before the next log gets stored?

181
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,430
I guess we need some luck.

182
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,020
Okay, then, we'll do what you just said...

183
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,200
Alright, guys! Let's go to Jaya, "Land of Meat"!

184
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,980
Yeah!

185
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,620
Don't dream up stuff like that!

186
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,200
I wonder what kind of place Jaya is.

187
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,390
Nami-san, Robin-chan!

188
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,810
Your "Unprecedented takoyaki
just for ladies" are ready!

189
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,820
Dammit! Who the hell are they?!

190
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,410
Monkey kicking me like that!!

191
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,960
Captain? Captain!

192
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,270
What?!

193
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,830
Er... Is this really the right place?

194
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,310
The legendary cave where Captain John,

195
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,440
who did many cruel things
for treasure, hid his treasure...

196
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,010
Yeah, that's right. Be careful going forward!

197
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,540
Listen, guards and traps
often accompany treasure.

198
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,780
If you let your guard down, you could die!

199
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,600
We don't know what kind
of monsters will appear,

200
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,400
or if it'll be a bloody trap from hell!

201
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,090
Now let's put in another
hard day's work on the tunnel!

202
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,750
Okay, boss!

203
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,150
"Boss"

204
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,980
Oh? You guys must be new recruits.

205
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,850
Hm?

206
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,600
Oh yeah, nothing like
workin' up a sweat, eh, Boss?!

207
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,750
Umph! A pickaxe is a man's tool, right?

208
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,780
Oh yeah, a pickaxe! With our sweat,
this will soon become a tunnel,

209
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,100
and it'll change into people's smiles.

210
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,570
That's right. And the alcohol
after work is really...

211
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,460
Why are you having me do honest work?!

212
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,990
So, Captain Buggy,
Captain John's treasure wasn't there.

213
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,280
You idiot, Mohji! Show some consideration!

214
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,000
It's obvious that Captain got the wrong island.

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,350
Are you trying to make him
go red with embarrassment?!

216
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,810
Who are you saying has
a huge red nose?! Huh?!

217
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,080
By the way, Captain... this is
no time for fooling around.

218
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:13,780
What're we gonna do? The Straw Hat guys
are real pirates on the Grand Line now.

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,280
Ha! You flashy idiot! Don't lose your head.

220
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
We'll just let them be for now.

221
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,320
What?! What do you mean?

222
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,810
You see, they say that
when a witch eats a child,

223
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,750
she first makes the kid nice and chubby.

224
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,760
Do you get that?

225
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,270
In short, the more those Straw Hat
guys' bounty money becomes...

226
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,030
Oh, I see! When you beat them,

227
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,080
your bounty will become greater than theirs!

228
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Oh!

229
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,030
Yeah, exactly!

230
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,680
I see, that's amazing!
Captain, shall we have a party?

231
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,890
Why not?!

232
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,950
It's no time to horse around, you guys.

233
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,140
If you can't find out where Luffy is,

234
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,910
how exactly are you planning to beat him?

235
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,730
Don't be so uptight, Alvida.

236
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,050
Nothing's wrong with having fun for now, right?

237
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,120
Luffy, you say? If you wanna
see Luffy, I'll tell you where he is.

238
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,570
See? He'll tell us Luffy's whereabouts.

239
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,000
Who the hell are you?!

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,340
Oh, sorry for interrupting your party.

241
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,850
I was brought forth by the
quite appetizing smell of food.

242
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,440
My name is Ace. Nice to meet you.

243
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,800
Oh, no need to be so formal.
Nice to meet you, too.

244
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,460
I'm asking you what you're doing here!!

245
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,430
I don't care about your name!
What a flashy insolent attitude!

246
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,830
Captain! Captain, this guy is... "Fire Fist"!

247
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,260
"Fire Fist Ace"!

248
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,470
He's the captain of Whitebeard's second unit!

249
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,010
Whitebeard?!

250
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,710
Oh? You guys know my boss? That's coo--

251
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,010
He fell asleep!!

252
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,780
No!

253
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,450
Why? This is a great opportunity
any way you look at it!

254
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,670
If we defeat Fire Fist Ace,
we'll become instantly famous!

255
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,660
I said no!

256
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,130
Listen up, guys. Remember this flashily!

257
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,200
No matter what happens, never mess
with the Whitebeard Pirates!

258
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,360
Whitebeard is a legendary monster.

259
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,890
He's the only one who fought neck and neck
with Roger, the King of the Pirates.

260
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,810
He's now, without a doubt,
the world's strongest pirate!

261
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,410
He's the man closest to that
secret treasure, One Piece!

262
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,460
And, above all, Whitebeard never
forgives the killing of one of his own.

263
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,140
Never! He's that kind of man.

264
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,070
You know an awful lot about him.

265
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,700
Of course...

266
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:59,190
Long ago... I met him in person,
here on the Grand Line.

267
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,350
Oh? You know my boss?

268
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,770
He's awake!!

269
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,190
Hey, you guys! Don't be shy!
It's a party. Let's have fun!

270
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,370
Uhh... He's right!
We were having a party, right?!

271
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,200
Hey, you drink quite a bit! Drink more!

272
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,710
Oh?! You guys have a lion?
Come! Jump through this fire hoop!

273
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,940
Okay, show him, Rich!

274
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,930
Where's the boss?!

275
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,240
Boss!!

276
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,680
Hey, my gang! I'm right here!

277
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,340
It doesn't look like he's around here.

278
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,030
Hey!

279
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,770
Let's go check over there!

280
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,220
Aye, aye, sir!

281
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,520
Hey! Wait! Don't leave!!

282
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,860
I wonder what kind of island Jaya is.

283
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,800
Like I said, it's a land of meat! A land of meat!

284
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,940
But you just wish it was, right?

285
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,690
Well, it's true that I'm tired of eating takoyaki...

286
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,830
Then, don't eat them. Those were
for Nami-san and Robin-chan!

287
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,420
They said they wouldn't eat them,
so what's the problem?!

288
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,600
Give them back! Give us back the takoyaki!

289
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,480
Shut up! Shut up!!

290
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,530
Shut up!

291
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,380
In any case, is there really an island in the sky?

292
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,650
We've experienced enough to know by now...

293
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,360
that no matter how illogical
things seem, it's not strange,

294
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,250
because it's this sea's logic.

295
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,960
So Jaya holds the key to go to the sky island.

296
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,810
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

297
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:27,860
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

298
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:43,800
There are days where I almost lose to myself

299
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:52,220
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

300
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,350
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

301
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:08,700
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

302
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:17,540
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

303
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,670
This unique moment...

304
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,780
This town looks rough.

305
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,890
Yeah, because it's Jaya.

306
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,950
Because it's a spring island as well.

307
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,280
You don't make sense!

308
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,720
I heard that this is a place for pirates to gather.

309
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,790
Sounds fun!

310
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,690
Hey, we came to gather information
on how to go to the sky island!

311
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,750
Don't you dare cause any
trouble here, got that?!

312
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,160
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,340
"Quit Dreaming!
Mock Town, the Town of Ridicule!"

314
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
