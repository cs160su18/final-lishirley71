2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,350
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,200
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

11
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

12
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,150
They landed on Punk Hazard; an island with two parts, one burning, the other frozen

13
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,610
and were held captive by Caesar Clown...

14
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,950
...to be used as guinea pigs for Shinokuni,

15
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,450
a weapon of mass destruction.

16
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,850
But the counter attack has begun with their ally - a Warlord - Trafalgar Law!

17
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,300
Franky...

18
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,100
...Fireball!

19
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,060
The ship is on fire!

20
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,100
Put out the fire!

21
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,440
Now that we are not being picked up on Caesar's Video Transponder Snail.

22
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,390
White Chase-ya, I have no obligation to save you

23
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,470
but if letting you go back to the base safely makes Vergo lose his footing,

24
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,250
it work out well for me.

25
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,450
However,

26
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,170
you need to forget everything that you heard about me and Joker.

27
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,820
I'm not asking you a favor.

28
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,090
It's a condition.

29
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,760
For sparing your life.

30
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,800
Hey, Kin'emon!

31
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,390
Can you cut iron?

32
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,770
That's not so hard to cut!

33
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,060
Brownbeard, keep charging like this!

34
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,020
I'm gonna charge!

35
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,050
"Get to Building R! The Pirate Alliance's Great Advance!"

36
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,710
What have you done?!

37
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,870
Oh no!

38
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,140
It's good that we made it in but the poison gas will come in, too!

39
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,990
Screw you guys! Are you trying to get us all killed?!

40
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,780
Everyone, try to plug up the hole!

41
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,950
Or we're all gonna die!

42
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,850
I guess we're safe now.

43
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,990
It's the end!

44
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,130
There is nowhere on Punk Hazard that is habitable!

45
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,220
It's still pretty dense.

46
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,940
One foot out the door and it will kill you.

47
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
How was it, Brook?

48
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,030
Yes, it was like a land of dead.

49
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,280
When I think of what would've happened if we couldn't plug the hole,

50
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,960
it terrifies me.

51
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,840
You terrify us, too!

52
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,410
Okay!

53
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,070
It's not okay!

54
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,790
We all could've died because of you!

55
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,460
We plugged the hole, too!

56
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,710
You guys are way more annoying than I expected!

57
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,970
Give it up, Straw Hats! You too, Brownbeard!

58
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,700
Now we're cornered?! We have nowhere to run!

59
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,900
We don't need to run.

60
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,650
Well, this is so predictable.

61
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,910
They shouldn't do that.

62
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,830
Th-They knew my name!

63
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,680
Oh, it's starting down there!

64
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,830
You two, don't stand in my way - or in his people's, understood?

65
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,180
Yeah.

66
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,010
Oh, Tra-guy! Hey you!

67
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,810
Now is the chance! Hurry up!

68
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,410
Switch us back!

69
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,860
You don't have to!

70
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,970
Hey, what are you saying, Sanji-kun?!

71
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,310
--Oh, it's nothing!
--No, we have to switch back!

72
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,350
Room.

73
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,370
--I want my body back! I want it back!
--It's not necessary...

74
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,080
Shambles.

75
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,960
Oh, damn! The dream is over!

76
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,450
I'm back!

77
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,090
But, oh?

78
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,870
Sanji-kun?

79
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,740
Why am I wearing a different coat?!

80
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,430
You took my clothes off, didn't you?!

81
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,230
I can explain...

82
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,400
Sanji, are you okay?!

83
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,060
Oh? My body...

84
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,940
But it's not just because of that punch.

85
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,250
Nami was beaten badly in that body by Caesar.

86
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,380
What?

87
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,220
H-Hey, what's the matter?!

88
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,410
I'm so glad that it was my body that got hurt!

89
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,020
You're so noble!

90
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,470
Everybody here, listen!

91
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,990
Law!

92
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Now, outside of this laboratory is filled with the poison gas

93
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,830
but there is one passage that

94
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,860
could lead you directly to the sea bypassing the air outside!

95
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,610
This laboratory consists of multiple buildings.

96
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,760
We're in Building A now.

97
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,160
If you go through the gate at the back of this building

98
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,550
and pass through Building B, the central part,

99
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,350
you'll find Building R.

100
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,730
There is a big door marked "R-66"

101
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,560
that is an entrance to the passage to the sea.

102
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,240
I'd rather not have to create a massacre but I can only give you two hours.

103
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,770
Those of you who stay longer than that,

104
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,180
I can't guarantee your safety.

105
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,360
What?!

106
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,270
Hey, what do you mean by that?!

107
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,920
--Hey!
--Screw you!

108
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,960
Is something gonna happen to the lab?

109
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,140
Depends on how things go.

110
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,170
I just have to do what I have to do now.

111
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,990
Hmm, I see.

112
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,200
Robin, could you do me a favor?

113
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,720
What is it?

114
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,450
G-5!

115
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,850
Smo-yan!

116
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,970
There are children who were kidnapped two years ago in this laboratory!

117
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,270
Retrieve them and head for the "R-66" door!

118
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,610
If he is right, you'll find a harbor there.

119
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,760
Steal a ship and let's escape from Punk Hazard!

120
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,280
Alright!

121
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,460
I wanna leave this shitty island already!

122
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,330
Children...

123
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,800
Everyone, let's split up and look for the children and take them to the passage!

124
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,340
It's "R-66"!

125
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,630
Okay!

126
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,860
Zoro! You can't go alone!

127
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,580
Wait for me, Momonosuke!

128
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,470
I'll save you at any cost!

129
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,560
Okay. I got it.

130
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,060
Thanks. Well then...

131
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,930
Wait for me, Caesar!

132
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,650
I'm not gonna get suffocated this time!

133
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,990
I'll beat you up and kidnap you!

134
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,780
You see? This is a great open experiment!

135
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,500
The Straw Hats, Trafalgar Law, the Navy G-5...

136
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,000
They all sacrificed themselves for me

137
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,500
to prove how powerful Shinokuni is!

138
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,790
What happened?

139
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,210
What's going on?

140
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,830
Why I don't see any G-5 soldier at the main entrance?

141
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,110
Why I don't see any solidified bodies?

142
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,550
I can't prove the power of Shinokuni without them.

143
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,300
The Straw Hats, Law, and Smoker... Did they die for sure?!

144
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,720
What do you think, Vergo?

145
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,970
One thing is clear.

146
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,770
They are not in that cage anymore.

147
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,510
What? What do you mean by that?!

148
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,990
G-5 is a group of rough meatheads.

149
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,060
I don't think they are smart enough to

150
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,290
get away from the gas on their own.

151
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,950
Which means?

152
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,000
I guess the Straw Hat and the others

153
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,880
broke out of the cage and helped the G-5 soldiers escape.

154
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,350
What?!

155
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,720
Let's go!

156
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,950
Tashigi, I want you to lead the G-5 soldiers.

157
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,150
Where are you going, Smoker-san?

158
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,900
Don't tell me you're going after Vergo!

159
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,840
I can't forgive him!

160
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,570
The law can't settle these matters, Tashigi!

161
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,160
I have to do it myself! He was messing around with the Navy!

162
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,550
Take me with you, then!

163
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,680
He... Vergo is so strong!

164
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,680
If something happens...

165
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,310
Who's gonna protect our men?

166
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,670
Help those fools escape. The children, too.

167
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,490
Smoker-san...

168
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,650
Is it true? Luffy got beaten by Caesar before?!

169
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,400
Yeah, we got caught off guard and suffocated, too.

170
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,070
He can manipulate gas! He's such a pain in the ass!

171
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,970
He can remove the oxygen out of the air!

172
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,770
We had been put to sleep by the yetis, too.

173
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,230
That's no good.

174
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,610
That's really no good!

175
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,720
We spent those two years for what?

176
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,530
Whoa, whoa, we're both still alive so...

177
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,340
Screw that!

178
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,060
Being caught off guard could cost us our lives from now on!

179
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,560
H-Hey!

180
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,520
Don't let them pass through!

181
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,610
Luffy!

182
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,860
Get out of our way already.

183
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,030
Luffy!

184
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,080
What is the Moss Head doing?

185
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,260
Hey, Luffy!

186
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,310
Zoro?

187
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,210
Get a grip!

188
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,690
This is just the beginning of the New World!

189
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,710
He's so tough on himself.

190
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Yeah, sorry! I won't drop my guard again!

191
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,130
It's Straw Hat!

192
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,690
I don't know what he's up to but take him down!

193
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,830
Gum-Gum...

194
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,830
...UFO!

195
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,810
I'm just gonna go!

196
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,980
Take it more seriously...

197
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,480
Master!

198
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
What's wrong?

199
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,330
With the pirate - Straw Hat Luffy in the lead,

200
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,790
all of the enemies have entered into the lobby of Building A

201
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,660
and they are advancing!

202
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,080
What?!

203
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,830
They got inside?!

204
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,960
How did they open that solid shutter?!

205
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,930
How did they break out of the cage?!

206
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,450
We don't know yet!

207
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,800
In any case, it's not good to have Law loose.

208
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,100
I have to kill him myself depending on what his purpose is.

209
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,690
Outta my way!

210
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,180
Let's go!

211
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,880
Inside the sealed-off lab...

212
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,510
...Luffy and the others frantically run
from the encroaching Shinokuni.

213
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,600
Facing instant death if unable to make it through the gate in their path...

214
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,980
...G-5 displays the Navy's pride!

215
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

216
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,610
"Tashigi's Tears! G-5's Desperate Breakthrough Plan!"

217
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
