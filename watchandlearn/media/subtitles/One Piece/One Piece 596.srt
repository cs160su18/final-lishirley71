2
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,460
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,850
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,940
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,480
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

11
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,320
After landing on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen,

12
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,530
the Straw Hats learned about the hideous
experiments performed by Caesar Clown, the Master,

13
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,830
and headed off to investigate
but as things got going,

14
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,730
Luffy came to form an alliance with
the Heart Pirates led by Trafalgar Law

15
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,760
and is now headed to see
the Master Caesar Clown.

16
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,180
I'll never let him take these children again.

17
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,640
I can't believe he was using them as
his test subjects and drugged them.

18
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,730
I can't forgive the Master guy!

19
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,110
Hey, look at that!

20
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,900
Wh-What's that?!

21
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,780
--Something's flying toward us!
--It's a big bomb!

22
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,870
No, it's not!

23
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,720
Cien Fleurs!

24
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,840
Wing!

25
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,760
Wham!

26
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,030
Master, show yourself!

27
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,530
We will kick your ass and kidnap you!

28
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,730
Luffy, that was supposed to be a secret.

29
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,280
Straw Hat!

30
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,110
Go, Luffy!

31
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,780
That fool! Who said anything
about confronting everyone?!

32
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,120
"On the Verge of Annihilation!
A Deadly Monster Comes Flying In!"

33
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,060
CAESAR'S LABORATORY - THE FRONT DOOR

34
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,540
That bastard! Did he just say he will
kick our Master's ass and kidnap him?!

35
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,360
Screw it! Take the Straw Hats down!

36
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,950
Strong...

37
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,240
...Right!

38
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,230
Smoker-san, what should we do?

39
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,030
Obviously, we have to capture the Straw Hats.

40
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,440
Catch the Straw Hats!

41
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Cien Fleurs!

42
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,490
Clutch!

43
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,960
CAESAR'S LABORATORY - THE BACKDOOR

44
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,350
What should we do?

45
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,620
Just let it be.

46
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,630
Let's go inside.

47
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,140
Do you have a key?

48
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,230
Oh, you can use teleportation, huh?

49
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,620
Room.

50
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,580
Do as we discussed.

51
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,610
Yeah. While you're taking Caesar
and that woman somewhere else,

52
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,740
I'm gonna find out about the drug.

53
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,700
Weapons Left!

54
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,550
We made it here but where's the Master?

55
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,690
I don't think he's out here.

56
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,700
Then where is he?

57
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,380
Probably in the lab.

58
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,790
Okay, that big door must be the entrance.

59
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,730
Let's go.

60
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,490
Straw Hat Luffy!

61
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,620
Oh, Smokey!

62
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,260
THE REMAINS OF THE FIRST
AND SECOND LABORATORY

63
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,140
Unchain me!

64
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,210
Big brothers, unchain me!

65
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Withdrawal symptoms again!
What should we do?!

66
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,650
We should just let them sleep
it off! I'll use it again!

67
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,240
Special Attack - Sleep Star!

68
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,040
Let me go!!

69
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,590
No way! Sleep Star didn't work?!

70
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,510
What?! What should we do now?!

71
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,060
Oh no!

72
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,830
They fell asleep at last.

73
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,450
But it didn't work as well as before.

74
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,710
Yeah, we're gonna have a problem
next time they wake up.

75
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,970
Straw Hat Luffy! What are
you up to on this island?!

76
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,720
Smokey! I'm glad that you're okay!

77
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,640
I was worried because they
were beating you up before!

78
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,230
Don't monkey around with me!

79
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,900
What? You have a stomachache?
Is it constipation?

80
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,240
I did it!

81
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,460
What happened, Smokey? You got weaker.

82
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,630
N-No, I'm...

83
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,670
On top of that, you sound strange today.

84
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,470
Hey hey, please.

85
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,090
Don't get your ass kicked by him...

86
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,510
...when you're in my body!

87
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,230
Oh, that weapon!

88
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,320
You're back out at sea, huh? Straw Hat!

89
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,070
But I won't let you do whatever you want!

90
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,920
I got hit.

91
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,260
It's tipped with Sea Prism Stone.

92
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,100
The girl with the glasses
became this strong, huh?

93
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,970
Her name was...

94
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,980
I'm Smoker!

95
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,980
What?!

96
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,990
Luffy, I think Law did it to them, too.

97
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,120
What? Ah, the "shuffle" thing. I see.

98
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,020
That's why that one was weak.

99
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,290
So this one is...

100
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,000
You're...

101
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,810
...Smokey?!

102
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,380
What's so funny?!

103
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,680
Fight me, Straw Hat.

104
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,180
Second Gear!

105
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,980
That makes it more exciting!

106
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,740
Strong...

107
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,370
...Right!

108
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,590
It'll take forever to beat all of them up.

109
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,170
Let's break the door and
get into the lab at once!

110
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,130
Here we go! Franky...

111
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,850
Too fast!

112
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,150
Let's finish this some other time!

113
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,940
What?!

114
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,990
It's not worth fighting when you
can't use all of your strength!

115
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,570
Don't get...

116
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,700
...saucy with me!

117
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,240
Bye, Smokey!

118
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,990
...Radical Beam!

119
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,930
He made a hole on the door!

120
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,930
How strong are they?!

121
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,220
Was it a laser beam?

122
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,230
Luffy, Robin, I broke the door!

123
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,930
Charge!

124
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,940
You did it already, Franky?!

125
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,660
Smo-yan!

126
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,780
Something strange is flying toward us!

127
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,280
There!

128
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,910
What is it?

129
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,420
That's...

130
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,590
What?

131
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,310
The ship!

132
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,810
What is that?

133
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,980
Luffy! Franky! Wait!

134
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
What is it?! It's moving!

135
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,530
Let me handle it!

136
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,830
You're giving me the creeps!

137
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,750
Wh-What is this?!

138
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,550
It's poison gas! Back off!

139
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,470
When it got cut and shot,
it spewed out poison gas!

140
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,790
Put on your gas mask!

141
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,980
Run!

142
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,790
Huh?! What the hell is that?!

143
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,850
Is it some kind of living thing?

144
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,900
I have no idea. What is that?

145
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,600
Say it! What is that?

146
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,740
I-I don't know! I've never seen such a thing!

147
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,680
It fell from the sky, didn't it?

148
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,290
Yeah, but it's moving!

149
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,120
It's disgusting!

150
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,640
Is it alive?

151
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,880
Oh, look!

152
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,220
They merge into one another...

153
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,150
...And get bigger!

154
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,900
What?!

155
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,950
I can just kill it by
pushing it into the river!

156
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,870
Hey, don't do it!

157
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,540
--Poison gas again!
--Pull him out!

158
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,550
1, 2, 3!

159
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,300
--Hey...
--I-It's...

160
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,470
Ow! Ow! It touched my skin!
Wipe it off! Somebody!

161
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,760
Hey, get me a piece of cloth!

162
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,560
We shouldn't touch it as I thought!

163
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,700
--What should we do?
--I don't know!

164
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,780
Back off, you guys!

165
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,680
It doesn't look like it's resistant to fire!

166
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,490
Let's just burn it!

167
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,740
Take this!

168
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,500
There is no living thing
that isn't afraid of fire!

169
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,820
You're smart!

170
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,590
Burn it up!

171
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,840
See, it's weak against fire!
That serves you right!

172
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,510
--Clearly, it's suffering!
--It's starting to burn!

173
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,100
Take it! Take it! Take it! Take it! Take it!

174
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
Yeah!

175
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,660
Take it! Take it!

176
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,140
What?!

177
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,300
You guys!

178
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,450
Hey, what just happened?

179
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,020
I don't know! I've never
seen something like that!

180
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,370
When we touch it, it spews poison
and when we burn it, it explodes!

181
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,030
We don't even know if it's alive
or not in the first place.

182
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,340
Who cares. It's gone now.

183
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,840
Oh yeah, you're right.

184
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,410
That's not all.

185
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,060
It killed those Navy soldiers who
stole the ship and sailed out as well!

186
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,820
For us, that was...

187
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,300
What?

188
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,430
It's here!

189
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,650
It fell from the sky again!

190
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,530
--That's like the one from before.
--How many are there?

191
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,880
Is it some kind of living thing?

192
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,430
I don't know. I've never seen such a thing.

193
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,380
Me, too.

194
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,340
I'm so stunned - my eyes
popped out of my head.

195
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,640
But I don't have eyes in the first place.

196
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,390
Quite a strange thing...

197
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,150
...Doing quite strange things.

198
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,110
Wow! It's really flying up high!

199
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,200
Isn't it coming toward us?

200
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,900
What is this?!

201
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,840
Disgusting!

202
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,690
It's raining down!

203
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,170
Run! Don't ever touch it!

204
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,320
Smoker-san, it's too dangerous here!

205
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,260
Let's take cover!

206
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,380
Yeah.

207
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,760
Good boy! I'm sorry that I
locked you up for three years!

208
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,970
Master!

209
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,560
Why are you here?! It's dangerous out here!

210
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,240
I knew it. So you're Caesar
Clown, aren't you?!

211
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,000
You are...

212
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,000
...the Master?!

213
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,870
Yes, indeed!

214
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,560
Everyone from the Straw Hat
Pirates and the Navy G-5!

215
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,010
Behold! The greatest scientist in the world!

216
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,050
Master Caesar Clown!

217
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,770
Just wait a few moments.

218
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,720
Since he's weak to water,

219
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,820
he's flinging pieces of himself
over little by little...

220
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,070
...in order to cross the lake!

221
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,410
From the Burning Lands...

222
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,210
...to the Ice Lands!

223
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,920
When all of his pieces reach this side,

224
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,350
you will all experience it!

225
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,930
The chemical weapon explosion that
happened four years ago on Punk Hazard!

226
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,980
A world of death in which no one can survive!

227
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,200
And you will learn!

228
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,040
Just how powerful my weapon is,
that it can destroy an island!

229
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,000
And the greatness of the world's best
scientist who created the weapon!

230
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,010
It's me - Master Caesar Clown!

231
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,370
I got you!

232
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,690
What?!

233
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,370
Luffy and Caesar Clown have an intense battle

234
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,090
where neither side is willing to yield.

235
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,260
At the end of the fierce battle,

236
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,510
Luffy believes that he has Caesar, but then

237
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,560
the fearsome power of the
Gas Gas Fruit is revealed.

238
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

239
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,500
"An Intense Battle!
Caesar Exercises His True Power!"

240
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
