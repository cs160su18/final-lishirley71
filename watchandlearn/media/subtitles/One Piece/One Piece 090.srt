Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,420
"Hiriluk's Cherry Blossoms!
Miracle in the Drum Rockies."

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,840
I will make cherry blossoms bloom.

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,820
Once my invention is complete,
this country will be saved!

24
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,690
I'll save this country as a doctor one day.

25
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,410
Humph!

26
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,450
Didn't you mean to say
"destroy the country"?

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,760
This is a winter island where
it's bitter cold year around.

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,630
Cherry blossoms won't bloom here.

29
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,200
They will!
I was a hopeless thug and dying,

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,360
but I lived on after seeing
those cherry blossoms.

31
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,100
I was able to have
a profound change of heart.

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,600
Every human in this world can be saved!

33
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,020
There's no disease in this
world that can't be cured.

34
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,260
I raised this skull towards
all the diseases!

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,630
This is a symbol of the belief
that nothing is impossible!

36
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,870
By raising this,
I'll fight just like pirates do!

37
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,430
Chopper, go out to sea some day.

38
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,340
If you do, you'll understand very
well how small your problems are.

39
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,610
Doctor... I...

40
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,220
Hm?

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,760
I found you!

42
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,600
Hey, monster! Come with us!

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,860
Hm?

44
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,600
Ah!

45
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,390
Are you all right, Dalton-san?!

46
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,010
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt
a little drained. That's all.

47
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,150
I'll be fine if I get some rest.

48
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,540
Hey, you guys!

49
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,240
Hm?

50
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,740
Ah! D-Dr. Kureha!

51
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,540
Hm?

52
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,190
Are you happy, brats?

53
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,250
Take that injured guy
to the medical ward.

54
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,630
Ahh! You're that damn old hag!

55
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,850
And anyone else injured, too!

56
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,890
Y-Yes, Ma'am!

57
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,910
Don't dilly-dally!

58
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,350
Do you want the same
experience as this man?!

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,660
Nami-san, you should have your
sickness treated all the way.

60
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,960
Quiet! If I don't escape from here now,

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,820
our departure for Alabasta
will be delayed by two days!

62
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,040
Do you wanna see Vivi keep suffering?!

63
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,280
Stop grumbling, you two...

64
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,630
and get back to the medical ward!

65
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,410
Ahhhh!

66
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,460
I'm Usopp! Captain Usopp!

67
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,010
As I thought, his injuries have gotten
worse... since he overexerted himself.

68
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,350
Now... Dalton...

69
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,660
Where's the key to this arsenal?
You know where it is, right?

70
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,790
Key to the arsenal...
Why do you need such a thing?

71
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,300
It's none of your business.

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,470
That key was... always carried
by Wapol from long ago.

73
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,060
So if it's still the case, it flew
off with Wapol into the sky...

74
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,260
What?! Is that right?! Oh darn...

75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,750
Doctorine...

76
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,640
Hm?

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,380
About the treatment fee for our crew...

78
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,160
would you make it all free?
Also, would you discharge me right away?

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,720
Did you ask just for the heck of
it knowing it's all impossible?

80
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,570
As my fee, I'll take the entire
cargo and money on your ship.

81
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,480
And you'll stay here and rest
at least for two more days!

82
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,530
Nami-san, she's right!
You should be treated all the way!

83
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,080
I'll be fine since I don't feel like I'll die!

84
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,500
That can't be a reason!

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,920
Ah...

86
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,580
You need the key to the arsenal, right?

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,760
What?! Why do you have that key?!

88
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,120
Is that the real one? How'd you get it?!

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,980
I stole it.

90
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,880
What?!

91
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,840
You've got guts dictating
terms to me like that.

92
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,800
You are really an unbelievable girl.

93
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,950
Okay then... You don't have
to pay my fee. But that's all.

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,910
I can't accept the other term as a doctor.

95
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,460
Wait a sec! If that's the case, I can't
give the key to you! Give it back!

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,420
Listen, girl.

97
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,650
I have to leave this room
now to take care of things.

98
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,160
There's a drawer chest with
my coat in the back room.

99
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
And it's not like I'm posting guards...

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,390
Also, that young man's backbone
treatment is already complete.

101
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,390
But listen, don't you dare escape!

102
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,970
You guys, come with me.
I need you for heavy lifting.

103
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,060
Yes, Ma'am!

104
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,540
She told me to wear her coat, take
Sanji-kun and escape using this chance.

105
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,950
Yeah... that's how it sounded to me, too.

106
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:18,940
Hmmm...

107
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,760
I sure ran around a lot.
Night came before I even knew...

108
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,860
I don't hear voices any more...
Looks like they're gone...

109
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,270
This is for the best...
I can't leave this place...

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,780
It's a full moon tonight...

111
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,180
--Hey! Reindeer!

112
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,870
--Hm?
--Hey! Reindeer!

113
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,580
--Hm?
--Let's be pirates together!

114
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,660
--No way! They're still looking for me!
--Let's be pirates together!

115
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,020
Hey, Luffy. Just give it up.

116
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,980
He hasn't shown up even after
all our efforts to find him.

117
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,130
He doesn't wanna be a pirate.

118
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,170
That's not true.
I wanna take him with us!

119
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,010
Like I said, that's what you want, right?!

120
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,970
It's not that I don't wanna go...

121
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,890
Reindeer!

122
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,890
Come out, reindeer!

123
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,910
But I won't go. I can't go!
I'm not like those guys!

124
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,180
Hm?

125
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,990
Reindeer!

126
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,780
Hm?

127
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,700
Tony-kun!

128
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,220
Hey, let's be pirates together! Okay?!

129
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,240
It's not possible.

130
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,100
Yes, it is since it's fun!

131
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,510
Hey, you don't make sense.

132
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,430
But...

133
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,660
But I'm a reindeer!
I have antlers and hooves!

134
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,440
I even have a blue nose!

135
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,740
Can you guys heal the scar in his heart?

136
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,460
It's true... that I wanna be a pirate, but...

137
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,040
I'm not even a human! I'm a monster!

138
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,890
I can't become your friend! So...!

139
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,900
So I just came to say thank you...

140
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,370
I do appreciate you guys.

141
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,490
Thank you for asking me to join you.

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,810
I'll stay here, but...

143
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,650
one day... if you feel like it,
stop by agai...

144
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,570
Shut up! Let's go!

145
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,750
You don't ask people to join you
by telling them to "shut up."

146
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,040
Hey, Nami! Are you really okay?

147
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm fine! I'm feeling great!

148
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,750
--Hey, let's go to say good-bye
--There! To commemorate our reaching here,

149
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,030
--to that old lady doctor and acorn pops, too.
--There! To commemorate our reaching here,

150
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,360
--to that old lady doctor and acorn pops, too.
--I built Snow Queen V!

151
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,330
--Don't be silly.
--I built Snow Queen V!

152
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:56,630
--Don't be silly.
--Hey, how dare you kick

153
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,250
--Let him be alone with Doctorine.
--Hey, how dare you kick

154
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,240
--Let him be alone with Doctorine.
--Snow Queen V! How disrespectful!

155
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,110
--He lived with her alone for 6 years.
--Snow Queen V! How disrespectful!

156
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,680
It'll sure be a tearful farewell...

157
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,960
Doctorine acts like that in front of us,

158
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,380
but she is actually a kind person.

159
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,150
Hmmm... Really?

160
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,820
Then, we're really leaving here
without saying anything to her, huh?

161
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,730
Of course. Once Chopper comes,
we'll go down the mountain

162
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,360
and set sail immediately... to Alabasta!

163
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,640
You're fine with that too, right, Vivi?

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Yeah, if a doctor comes with us...

165
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,680
A doctor?

166
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,540
Okay then, I'll get the ropeway ready.

167
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey, Luffy! Give me a hand.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,300
I didn't realize there was
a ropeway... That's amazing!

169
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,070
Now, hurry up and take them out!

170
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,070
Once they're outside
the gate, line them up!

171
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,050
Dr. Kureha!

172
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,810
Hm?

173
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,940
What are we taking so many
cannons out of the arsenal for?

174
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,030
Just hurry up and take them out!

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,160
Hm?

176
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,130
Oh? It seems there are
some patients missing.

177
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,920
They escaped...
disobeying your order...

178
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,430
I see... What am I going
to do with them...?

179
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,940
Doctorine!

180
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,040
Doctorine!

181
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,650
I have something to talk about with you!

182
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,110
Chopper, where have you been?

183
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,470
Go downstairs and help
them take the cannons out.

184
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,680
Listen, Doctorine!
I'm gonna be a pirate.

185
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm going with them!

186
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,020
What?!

187
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,550
I'm going out to sea.

188
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,550
I'll join them as a ship's doctor
and travel around the world!

189
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,420
Don't be ridiculous!

190
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,350
Now listen. You're my only assistant!

191
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,180
Who do you think taught you medicine?!

192
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,640
Or are you saying you don't
feel any gratitude towards me?!

193
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,110
Th-That's not true!
I do appreciate you, Doctorine!

194
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,400
I also love this land
where I met Doctor and you!

195
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,680
Humph! Then you can stay here.

196
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,370
You can't live in a fine castle
like this no matter where you go.

197
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Pirates are good for nothing!
You'll end up dead in no time.

198
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,710
That's okay!

199
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,930
Don't talk so cocky!

200
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,650
I've never heard of a mere
reindeer going out to sea.

201
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,890
That's right. I'm a reindeer!
But I'm a man, too!

202
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,480
You sure talk big...
In any case, I won't allow it.

203
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,200
If you wanna leave that bad,
you have to get through me first!

204
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,490
Doctorine...

205
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,410
A crybaby like you is a man?!

206
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,910
Don't make me laugh!

207
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,880
Doctorine... But they...

208
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,460
Shut up! Let's go!

209
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,920
understand...

210
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,170
Shut up!

211
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,390
I won't allow you to have your way!

212
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,860
Come back, Chopper!

213
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,360
Wait!

214
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,190
Hm? It seems noisy...

215
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,430
Well, no matter what's going on,

216
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,710
we'd better take the cannons in
this arsenal outside the castle,

217
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,810
or Dr. Kureha will throw a
spear or something at us.

218
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,120
Don't be silly...

219
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,150
Wait!

220
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,750
Hm?

221
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,960
I won't let you escape!

222
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,280
Chopper!

223
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,310
Come back!

224
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,920
What's going on?
It's noisy inside the castle.

225
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,120
Gee, how thoughtless...

226
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,840
Why can't they be quiet when
others are saying farewell?

227
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,050
I'm sorry, Doctorine!
But I wanna see the world!

228
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,070
What do you think someone
like you can do at sea?!

229
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,540
Are you gonna live in a fantasy
just like that quack did?!

230
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,080
You're wrong! It wasn't a fantasy!

231
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,960
Doctor's research had
actually been completed!

232
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,780
Hey, he's coming...?! Hm?!

233
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,170
What?!

234
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,390
What's going on?! He's being chased!

235
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,820
Hey! The ropeway is rea... Hm?

236
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,640
Everyone! Get on the sleigh!
We'll go down the mountain!

237
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,190
What?!

238
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,000
Hey, look...

239
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,420
What the heck is that?

240
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,000
Ah! That's the witch's sleigh!

241
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,710
What was that?!

242
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,780
It was Dr. Kureha's reindeer.

243
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,970
The ones on the sleigh
were those pirates!

244
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,750
What happened up there?!

245
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,180
What the heck happened to Wapol?
Is Dalton-san okay?!

246
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,930
That felt good! Hey, do it again!

247
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,870
You idiot! We're setting sail right away!

248
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,790
I-I thought I'd die...

249
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,900
Hm? Where am I?!

250
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,160
Ah, Sanji-san! You came to?

251
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,420
Was it okay to bid farewell like that?

252
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,550
A pet I was taking care of is being
taken in by someone else. That's all.

253
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,010
I don't like... tears...

254
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,100
--Come with me!

255
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,030
--Ow!
--Come with me!

256
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,500
We have to prepare a flashy send off!

257
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,650
Ouch...

258
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,380
I finally did it... This is it...

259
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,580
I've waited for this reaction for 30 years...

260
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,420
Doctor! It wasn't just a fantasy, right?!

261
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,540
Your research was completed then, right?!

262
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,570
Or, was that a lie, too?

263
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,010
I did it, Chopper! My research succeeded!

264
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,620
Did you lie because I'd be sad
if you died without saying so?

265
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,900
"Nothing is impossible for the man
who raised a flag with a skull!"

266
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,970
Please say it again, Doctor!

267
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,940
Are you ready, young men?!

268
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,140
Yes, Ma'am!

269
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,320
Fire!

270
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,820
Listen, Kureha. This dust is...

271
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,990
Dr. Kureha! What in the world...?

272
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,370
Just shut up and watch.

273
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,630
The noises are coming from the castle!

274
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,080
Hm? Has Wapol started
fireworks or something?

275
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,630
Idiot! They're cannon noises!

276
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,040
What's happening?!

277
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,240
Watch out for the cannonballs!

278
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,140
Dammit! We can't see
anything since it's night!

279
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,680
Dr. Kureha! We shot all of them!

280
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,430
Light them up!

281
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,490
Amazing...

282
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,360
Yeah...

283
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,820
It's so beautiful...

284
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,040
This is the answer that
I found spending 30 years.

285
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,790
What a fantastic sight this is...

286
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,010
I can't understand what
that idiot was thinking...

287
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,160
I will make cherry blossoms bloom.

288
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,970
Once my invention is complete,
this country will be saved!

289
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,360
Get out of here, quack!

290
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,540
Dammit! I thought lizard
eyeballs would work...

291
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,660
Listen. This red dust isn't ordinary dust.

292
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,300
This will attach to the
white snow in the air

293
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,740
and make vivid pink snow fall.

294
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,420
Doctor...! Doctorine...!

295
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,680
I will never shoot you!

296
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,960
My name is Dr. Hiriluk! I'm a doctor!

297
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,660
Tony Tony Chopper.
That's a cool name, isn't it?

298
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,920
That's what I'll call you.

299
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,930
Chopper, you'll be able to become
a good doctor. I'll guarantee it.

300
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,810
Even if I disappear,
my dream will come true.

301
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,360
I had... such a good life!

302
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,460
Thank you, Chopper!

303
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,300
Now, have a safe trip, my stupid son...

304
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:24,040
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

305
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:36,740
From today forth,
something's going to change

306
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

307
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:57,190
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

308
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:07,940
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

309
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:16,290
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

310
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,960
Before dawn

311
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,650
Hey, Chopper! What's the matter?

312
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,130
How long are you gonna be in a daze?

313
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,420
Come here and dance! Sing!

314
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,960
Shhhh! Leave him alone for now!

315
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,440
He's experiencing what it's like
to set out on a journey as a man.

316
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,860
Okay, then! Let's toast to our new friend!

317
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,730
Yeah!
