00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,280
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,390
That's it!

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,940
I never thought of that!

25
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,410
The final round of the
Davy Back Fight is underway.

26
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,620
The epic battle between the two captains...

27
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,410
...has finally reached a climax!

28
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,210
Luffy...!

29
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,880
I won't... let you have...
a single member of my crew...

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,550
...even if it costs me my life!

31
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:52,980
"Epic, Heated Combat!
The Fateful Final Conclusion"

32
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,360
With great drive, Straw Hat Luffy
gets back on his feet yet again!

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,700
--Even after countless knockdowns...
--Luffy...!

34
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,120
...he just gets right back up!

35
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,330
Just what are you?!

36
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,580
Luffy!

37
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,750
He's unsteady on his feet!

38
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,840
Luffy!

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,220
And he's out of breath!

40
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,470
This guy is incredible!

41
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,840
And yet...

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,680
...he still stands tall with a glimmer in his eye!

43
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,850
All for his friends!

44
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,980
Yes! Now this is a Davy Back Fight!

45
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,940
I'm so teary-eyed I... I can't see straight!

46
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,070
Luffy!

47
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,860
Luffy!!

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,660
--I'm moved to tears!
--Afro dude!

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!...

50
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,540
A Luffy chant comes up from the crowd!

51
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,340
Has there ever been any other foe
who's given our boss so much trouble?!

52
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,050
What do you idiots think you're doing,
cheering the enemy on?!

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,060
--Boss...!
--Boss!

54
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,060
Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss!...

55
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,650
Just you watch. I'll end this now!

56
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,360
Slow-Slow Beam Sword!

57
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,160
You'll have to do better than that!

58
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,500
Damn! He hasn't got
enough strength left to run?!

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,630
I can't stand to watch Luffy like this!

60
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,590
Okay! It's time to finish this!

61
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,420
Slow-Slow Beam!

62
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,090
Our boss makes the first move!
He starts by slowing down a cannonball!

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,850
Foxy Fighter!

64
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,220
A Megaton Punch with
the speed of a cannonball!

65
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,100
It'll knock you out for good!

66
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,690
There it is! Our boss's cannonball stunt flying!

67
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,610
He's going for the finishing blow
aboard the Foxy Fighter!

68
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,610
Luffy! He used a beam
on you just before the ball!

69
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,950
Dodge as soon as you can move!

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,460
Oh! I can move!

71
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,670
The beam wears off on Straw Hat
just a moment sooner!

72
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,590
It's no use!

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,340
There's no escape!

74
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,720
Luffy! Look out!

75
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,270
Here's a present for you!

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,980
He got him! All of his attacks nail Straw Hat!

77
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,860
Luffy!

78
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,820
Boss! Boss! Boss!...

79
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,700
What's with him?!
He didn't have to go that far!

80
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,170
H-H-He's...

81
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,000
He's back up!

82
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,300
How...?!

83
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,570
I... win.

84
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,370
What?! You're barely
even able to stand upright!

85
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,490
But if that's how you want it...

86
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,080
...I'll pound you until you stay down!

87
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,620
Megaton Nine-Tails...!

88
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,960
Gum-Gum...

89
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,380
...Rush!

90
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,170
...Gatling!

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,560
Such intensity!

92
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,390
The combatants now exchange an
even more ferocious flurry of punches!

93
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,890
Slaughter 'im, Luffy!

94
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,600
Beat him!

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,520
Their barrages don't stop!
They just keep going!

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,250
Slow-Slow Beam!

97
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,210
Oh...?!

98
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,010
--What the...?
--He stopped moving...

99
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,030
S-Straw Hat has been knocked down!

100
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,990
No! Strike that!

101
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,990
Straw Hat is the one who's moving!

102
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,360
Just what has transpired?!

103
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,950
Curse... you...

104
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,410
How?!

105
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,120
Boss?!

106
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,050
A mirror! A mirror fragment
has fallen from Straw Hat's hand!

107
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,670
It was stuck... in my afro...

108
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,510
It's from the mirror in your room!

109
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,890
You little...!

110
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,350
Gum-Gum...

111
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,240
...Flail!

112
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,430
Oh, no...!

113
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,930
--Eight seconds to go.
--Huh?

114
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,890
Huh?!

115
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,850
Could this be what I think it is...?!

116
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,730
Seven.

117
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,650
What?

118
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,070
Six.

119
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,650
Boss!

120
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,330
Five!

121
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,370
What are you guys doing?!
Start counting too! Four!

122
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,290
--What?
--Dunno! But it seems fun!

123
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,630
Three!

124
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,050
Two!

125
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,470
One!

126
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,450
Three!

127
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,320
Two!

128
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,120
One!

129
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,200
Zero!

130
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,880
Hurray!

131
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,470
Luffy!

132
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,180
Boss!

133
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,060
Our boss is sent soaring!

134
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,940
Boss!

135
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,570
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

136
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,000
And he lands...

137
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,340
...outside the battlefield!

138
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,170
The final combat round of the Davy Back Fight

139
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,800
has ended after a heated, epic
battle between the two captains!

140
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,550
Our boss's legendary record of 920
wins and 0 losses has been snapped!

141
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,010
Unbelievably, victory goes...

142
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,530
I won't... let you have...
a single member of my crew...

143
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,360
...even if it costs me my life!

144
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,700
...to Straw Hat Luffy!

145
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,790
Luffy! You did it!

146
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,330
Luffy!

147
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,260
Our boss... lost...

148
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,510
Foxy Pirates versus...

149
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,930
Hey! Don't just sit there!
The boss needs our help!

150
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,390
All right! I'll go!

151
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,970
...the Straw Hats!

152
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,060
--I'm going! Move!
--I'm going too!

153
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:58,280
This orthodox-rules, three-coin game
Davy Back Fight is now over!

154
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,740
Boss!

155
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,830
Boss!

156
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,510
Geez, could you have been any more reckless?!

157
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,890
Take this! And this!

158
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,470
Quit poking him so much!
He's seriously hurt, you jerk!

159
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,720
--And this!
--Afro power, my butt.

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,020
He had us worried the entire time...

161
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,810
Afros really are powerful, Nami-san!

162
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,360
Oh! He's conscious!

163
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,400
H-Huh?!

164
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,780
The game! How'd the game end?!

165
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,030
I thought I won... Was it just a dream?!

166
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,040
Don't worry. You won.

167
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,920
That's a relief...

168
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,630
I was never worried in the least!

169
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,090
Liar.

170
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,350
Now that I think about it, I got no reason
to be a pirate for any other ship.

171
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,520
--Boss!
--You should really stay still!

172
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,270
Hey, Straw Hat!

173
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,150
How dare you tarnish my
legendary undefeated streak?!

174
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,190
Boss!

175
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,700
Put 'er there, brother!

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,240
--Boss!
--Boss!

177
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,660
All right, Boss!

178
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,960
Spiteful Shoulder Throw!

179
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,340
Boss!

180
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,500
Are you that stupid?

181
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,210
Have you forgotten the rules?

182
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,420
Choose your 500 people already!

183
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,550
Yes! The final exchange awaits!

184
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,470
Chopper and Robin!

185
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,730
Thank you! I'm so happy!

186
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,150
You can have this back.

187
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,950
He starts off with two obvious choices!

188
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,830
Now who'll be next?! Hurry and decide!

189
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,660
Give us your pirate flag!

190
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,790
What?!

191
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,420
You can't be serious! You'd strip
us of our pride just like that?!

192
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,590
I don't need your sail.
You need it to go places, after all.

193
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:31,010
--Wow! He's so merciful!
--But our symbol's on there!

194
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,970
How do you expect us to use the sail?!

195
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,850
We don't need your pity! Just take what's yours!

196
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,980
All right.

197
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,900
Since your mark is all we need,
I'll draw a new one over it for you.

198
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,610
That way you can keep your sail.

199
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,950
Straw Hat... You're such a...!

200
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,950
"Fox"

201
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,030
There!

202
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,950
This sucks...!

203
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,960
--Wow, they're really grateful!
--No, we ain't!

204
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,580
H-Hold on just a minute!

205
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,420
You still have 497 more people to pick!

206
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,630
We don't need any more.

207
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,840
Rules are rules! You have to
choose 497 people, like it or not!

208
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,060
Aww. Do I have to?

209
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,810
Of course you do, idiot!

210
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,810
Luffy! A captain's orders are absolute... Right?

211
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,310
Yes. In which case...

212
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,730
Oh! Good thinking!

213
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,820
Huh? Huh?!

214
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,610
What? What?!

215
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,320
Oh! Okay!

216
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,700
I'll choose, then!

217
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,240
You!

218
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,460
--Me?
--Yeah. Everyone from you...

219
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,920
--...to you.
--Me?

220
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,590
How many people is that?

221
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,630
Well, we have 500 in our crew,

222
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,550
so excluding our boss, Hamburg-san,
and Porche-chan, that makes...

223
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,560
Oh, 497 exactly! It's 497 people...

224
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,350
...Captain Luffy!

225
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,520
Okay! It's decided!

226
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,270
The Straw Hats are victorious!

227
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,070
This concludes the Davy Back Fights!

228
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,950
It's the birth of the New Straw Hat Pirates!

229
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,040
But the Merry can't hold this many people...

230
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,120
We'll just have to follow along
in the Sexy Foxy for a while.

231
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,130
I guess so!

232
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,000
D-Don't be stupid!

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,760
The Sexy Foxy is my ship!

234
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Your ship?

235
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,600
I'd love to see the three of you run
this huge ship all by yourselves!

236
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,930
Never gonna happen!

237
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,180
Never gonna happen...

238
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,520
Fine, then! Jerks!

239
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,820
--So long, Former Boss!
--Don't catch a cold!

240
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,320
--Brush your teeth!
--Take a bath!

241
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,490
Hey! Straw Hat!

242
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,660
I'll get you for this!

243
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,910
Do they ever stop being comedians?

244
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,120
All right, men!

245
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,710
Here's your first job as members
of the New Straw Hat Pirates!

246
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,510
Listen well!

247
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,800
--You can count on us!
--Rubber Boss!

248
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,680
You're all off the crew!

249
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,140
--You're kicking us out?
--Yep.

250
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,020
A captain's orders are absolute, remember?

251
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,780
You can go back to your old crews,
or even to Split-Head if you want!

252
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,320
You're free to go now!

253
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,070
That's all!

254
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,570
Former Boss! Wait up!

255
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,370
We belong with the Foxy Pirates after all!

256
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,370
How cunning.

257
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,630
Looks like it's all over.

258
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,140
Don't worry. They won.

259
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,220
There, there. I won't ride on stilts ever again.

260
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,270
We can follow the village together now,
however many years it takes.

261
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,400
You folks...!

262
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,570
I went and kicked their butts!

263
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,410
You're really hurt...

264
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,330
This is nothing new.

265
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,960
Thank you...

266
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,890
Ah, so that's why you accepted their challenge.

267
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,050
Not like you wouldn't have otherwise, though.

268
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,430
Man, you're rude!

269
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,860
Wh-What is this?!

270
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,240
Yikes!

271
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,360
Who are you?!

272
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,870
No, who are you?!

273
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,160
Th-The thing can talk!

274
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,620
I'm not a thing! I'm a mooole!

275
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,670
"Mooole"? Like a mole?

276
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm the champion! Yo!

277
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,420
Not another weirdo...

278
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,260
Champion of what?!

279
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm glad you asked!

280
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,800
I'm the world champion of hole-digging!

281
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm challenging my own record as we speak!

282
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,560
What kind of challenge has you
wrecking the old stilts guy's house?!

283
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,900
"Old stilts guy"...?

284
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,280
Take a look. This is a "mooole."

285
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,910
Littonto. I'm about to go for
the stilt-standing world record.

286
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,870
Huh?!

287
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,170
Competing with the world is a long, hard road.

288
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,880
I'll be gone a few days. The mooole
will keep you company, though, right?

289
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,630
Can you manage while I'm gone?

290
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,890
Sure. But make sure you
come back as a champion!

291
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,680
But of course I will!

292
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,180
I promise!

293
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,150
Could it be? Are you...?!

294
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,810
It's me!

295
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,110
--Grandpa!
--Littonto!

296
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,110
I missed you! I missed you so much!

297
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,740
You went and grew so much
since I last saw you...!

298
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,910
I'm sorry for worrying you...

299
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,580
He's your grandson?

300
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,550
I missed my grandpa so much,
and that devotion led me to hole-digging!

301
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,260
And before I knew it, becoming
the greatest digger in the world

302
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,010
had become my greatest goal in life...

303
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,550
So you became the champion?

304
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,060
Yep! "Shoot for the other side of the world!"

305
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,600
I like that! You sound
just like the old stilts guy!

306
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,070
--Oh, you're too kind!
--That's not praise!

307
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,740
Say, couldn't you follow your
holes to reach your village?

308
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,530
Oh...

309
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,080
Isn't this great, old guy?!

310
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,250
Yes. I don't know how to begin thanking you...

311
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,830
Don't worry about it!

312
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,340
You too, Miss! I achieved my true goal,
all thanks to your insight!

313
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,220
I'll never forget what you've done for us!

314
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,470
Thank you!

315
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,140
Take care on your way home!

316
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,480
You too! I pray for your safe journey!

317
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,320
All right! Time for us to leave!

318
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Nami! Is the Log ready?

319
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,110
Yep! We're good to go!

320
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,280
Let's get movin', then.

321
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,870
Yeah.

322
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,330
Let's hurry and snag us a shipwright!

323
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,580
Yeah!

324
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,960
All right, men!

325
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,010
Let's go find a shipwright!

326
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,430
Yeah!

327
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

328
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

329
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,950
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

330
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

331
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

332
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

333
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

334
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

335
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

336
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

337
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

338
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

339
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

340
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

341
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

342
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

343
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,870
Eternally... Eternally...

344
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,510
--Umm... What am I doing again?
--Who are these guys?

345
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,260
Why am I with a bunch of pirates?!

346
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,220
Who what where am I?

347
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,510
--Don't tell me all your memories are...!
--Oh, my head! My head!

348
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,890
--Are you okay, Long-nose?
--Oh, it's so itchy...!

349
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,350
Shut up, all of ya!

350
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

351
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,980
"Was It Lost? Stolen? Who Are You?"

352
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
