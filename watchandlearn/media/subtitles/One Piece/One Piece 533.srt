00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,880
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,900
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,480
Luffy and his crew returned
to Sabaody Archipelago.

77
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,530
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level,

79
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,040
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,830
along with Vander Decken who is after

81
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,590
the Mermaid Princess are
engaging in secret maneuvers.

82
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,630
Nice to meet you, Hordy Jones!

83
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,310
The Straw Hats find themselves caught
up in the turmoil little by little...

84
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,060
Isn't there anywhere you wanna go?

85
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,110
Huh?

86
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,650
Of course, there are a lot
of places that I want to go...

87
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,320
That's what I thought.
Then let's get out of here!

88
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,540
If something's thrown at
you again, I'll deflect it!

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,620
He's formidable!

90
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,250
Take this!

91
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,170
Zoro!

92
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,510
I thought you'd been captured!

93
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,470
I heard the sound of this
festival so I let myself out!

94
00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:00,900
"It's an Emergency!
The Ryugu Place Is Occupied!"

95
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,490
What the...

96
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,040
How did he get out of jail?!

97
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,210
What a fighter!

98
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,050
He warded off the God of the Sea -
King Neptune's attack easily!

99
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,970
If you resist, we'll have
casualties on both sides.

100
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,720
Surrender with good grace-jamon, Zori!

101
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,470
It's Zoro!

102
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,810
You guys! Rupture the
bubbles around them at once!

103
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,890
Minister of the Right!

104
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,520
It's better for us to
fight them in the water.

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,270
Hurry up!

106
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,160
Ah, we've been driven to the wall.

107
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,740
You're right. This is no good. Hey, Nami!

108
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,500
Oh? Nami?

109
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,580
Wh-What the...

110
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,430
What?! All the water is gone?!

111
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,680
Sorry!

112
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,520
I just found a Bubbly Coral, this big.

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,940
Wow, that's big!

114
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,730
Now...

115
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,400
let's continue where we left off.

116
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,910
Wait, wait. I'll fight him-jamon.

117
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,870
No! Don't bother, Neptune-sama!

118
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,370
No, that man is strong.

119
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,750
And I don't want anyone else
to get hurt anymore-jamon!

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,680
Well, hurry up and get ready!

121
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,230
Let's go out, right now!

122
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,730
Huh? R-R-Right now?

123
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,820
B-But I... I mean, I still...

124
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,740
Still what?

125
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,700
I-It's too sudden so I still... Um...

126
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,670
I can't sort my feelings out.
Could you give me a little more time?

127
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,380
It's just a walk, it's not a big deal.

128
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,590
Boy. Don't take too long.

129
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,930
I don't like you after all.

130
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,440
Alright, alright.
I'll wait so just make up your mind.

131
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,940
What have you guys done?!

132
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,240
No matter how I look at it, this is overkill!

133
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,030
He's right! You should regret your actions!

134
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,410
You guys started this fight!
So you're my accomplices, you idiots!

135
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,130
We were gonna just intimidate them and run!

136
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,920
I was just enjoying
sightseeing and shopping.

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,430
What's done is done! Stop complaining!

138
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,800
"What's done is done"?!

139
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,640
Stopping by the Fish-Man Island

140
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,480
and occupying the palace accidentally
- what are we? Some kind of evil pirates?!

141
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,190
Ow, ow, ow...

142
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,730
Then we should've allowed
ourselves to be beaten?

143
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,530
I told you "Let's wait for a
chance and run" many times!

144
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,070
I don't know the way out
and Luffy is missing!

145
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,610
That's right. Luffy is missing!

146
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,070
Where did he go?

147
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,330
Dunno.

148
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,540
We really have to go so
don't be mean and tell me!

149
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,750
Yeah, where is Luffy...

150
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,630
Where is the treasure chamber?

151
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,540
No!

152
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,960
What? Why?

153
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,050
Stop pretending you're naive! Be sensible!

154
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,430
Hey, everybody! When you're
sad, let's sing and be happy!

155
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,890
Come on!

156
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,890
It's gonna be alright! It's gonna be alright!

157
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,060
If it's not,
-- you're gonna die someday anyway, yeah!

158
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,230
Shut up already, Soul King!

159
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,070
Neptune-sama, are you alright?

160
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,490
I can't believe that this is happening to
King Neptune, the Great Knight of the Sea!

161
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,290
I can't fight when I've thrown out my back...

162
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,500
I-I got old...

163
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,260
It's my fault-jamon. I'm sorry.

164
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,600
We should've broken their bubbles and
made them fight in the water earlier.

165
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,520
I can't believe we let
them drain all the water...

166
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,730
Can't take it!

167
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,310
Hey, you bastards!

168
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,520
When the 3 formidable princes

169
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,440
of Neptune's army - Fukaboshi,
Ryuboshi, Manboshi come back,

170
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,820
you won't get away with this!

171
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,120
Yeah!

172
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,120
In any case, we can't
stay here on this island.

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,170
Where's the Sunny? Let's bring
everybody together and sail out soon.

174
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,960
But the coating on the Sunny came
off when we entered this island.

175
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,840
The Log Pose hasn't been
working right for a while too.

176
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,640
It has been unstable since we got here.

177
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,270
I can't take it! That Pose is not good
enough to sail across the New World.

178
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,350
You ignorant pirates!

179
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,810
What? This is not good
enough? What do you mean?

180
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,190
I'll tell you if you untie me.

181
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,040
Ding dong!

182
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,910
It must be Prince Fukaboshi!

183
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,620
Ding dong!

184
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,710
Ding dong!

185
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,550
This is weird. What are the guards doing?

186
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,880
Clank.

187
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,680
Hello? Who is it?

188
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,180
Don't pick it up!

189
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,930
--Prince Fukaboshi!
--Help us!

190
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,270
Shut up, you guys!

191
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,650
--Prince Ryuboshi!
--Prince Manboshi!

192
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,690
I think, Brother,
something is going on-la-ti-do!

193
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,990
I agree! Are Father and Shirahoshi alright?

194
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,290
It's me, Fukaboshi. What
is going on in there?

195
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,540
Lower the gate now and let us in.

196
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,830
And then what?

197
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,340
I can't do that.

198
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Hey! What are you saying?!
Just be honest and tell him!

199
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,640
Yeah guys, tie me and Camie up too!
They'll think we're your accomplices.

200
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,430
Zoro-chin's scary!

201
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,810
--Help us!
--Prince Fukaboshi!

202
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,610
Are you a member of the Straw Hats?

203
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,660
Fukaboshi! That's the Three-Sword
Style swordsman of the Straw Hats -

204
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,620
"Pirate Hunter" Zori!

205
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,500
--It's Zoro!
--Father!

206
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,160
You have Father too!

207
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,630
Like you just heard, we have
Neptune and many other hostages.

208
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,220
If you don't want me to kill them,
prepare for us to set sail!

209
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,260
We need our ship - Sunny,
with a fresh coating on.

210
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,140
We don't know where it is
so go find it on your own.

211
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:39,900
And we need the rest of our crew - a gloomy
woman, a robot, a racoon, and a dirty water imp.

212
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,190
And Zoro, one billion berries in cash.

213
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,240
No, you stop!

214
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,780
"Dirty water imp"... That's funny!
Can't stop laughing!

215
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,490
Stop laughing, you fool!

216
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,210
--"Dirty water imp"...
--What about "gloomy woman"...

217
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,460
I understand your conditions.

218
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,540
I'll make an arrangement for you
to leave this country immediately

219
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,460
with all of your friends.

220
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,340
However,

221
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,840
I want all the hostages back alive!

222
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,010
That's fine.

223
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,300
Brother!

224
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,180
We have no choice.

225
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,560
This gateway is the only way to
enter the Ryugu Palace even for us.

226
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,020
It's impossible to break in elsewhere

227
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,440
since it's covered with
several layers of bubbles.

228
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,320
There is one more thing, Zoro-kun?

229
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,330
I wouldn't normally tell you
this under the circumstances

230
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,000
but I can't ignore my duty to Jimbei.

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,920
What is it?

232
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,210
This is from the former Warlord - "First
Son of the Sea" Jimbei to Straw Hat Luffy.

233
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:48,720
He left 2 messages for me to
give you when you arrived.

234
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,140
Jimbei...

235
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,140
--Jimbei...
--Boss Jimbei...

236
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,930
Jimbei?!

237
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,900
Luffy said that he became
friends with Jimbei!

238
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,860
Ah, he was in the newspaper with Luffy-san.

239
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,950
Although he's a pirate, he's a big
figure that people on the island trust.

240
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,910
Luffy is not here but I'll
tell him later. Go ahead.

241
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,300
First, he says to not fight against Hordy.

242
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,680
Second, he'll be waiting at the Sea Forest.

243
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,720
That's all.

244
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,100
Clank.

245
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,980
The Sea Forest?

246
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Hordy?

247
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,210
And that's what happened.

248
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,800
So I want you to find the Straw Hats' ship
and the rest of them as soon as possible.

249
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,930
Roger that.

250
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,180
Roger that.

251
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,720
Roger that.

252
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,150
Hey hey, did you hear that?
The Straw Hat Pirates did it!

253
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,650
They took over the Ryugu Palace!

254
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,780
What do they want?!

255
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,200
No way! They looked like really good people
- I can't believe they did such a thing!

256
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,780
I can't believe it!

257
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,290
--Can't believe it!
--Yes, I can believe it.

258
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,410
--Maybe I can't either.
--I can't believe it, so what?

259
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:47,050
I'm sure they're the ones who kidnapped
the Mermaids and the prediction is true!

260
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,460
That's how things are progressing!

261
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,840
They finally showed their true colors!

262
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,970
I heard the 2 of them are hiding
in the back of the Mermaid Cafe.

263
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,560
Guards are heading there to catch them!

264
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,730
--What is this animal?
--He transformed himself!

265
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,950
Kung Fu Boost!

266
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,750
Sanji just got better! Stay away from him!

267
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,710
"Come to the Ryugu Palace"?
You're trying to catch us, aren't you?

268
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,170
Hey, guys...

269
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Sanji, you should still be in bed!

270
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,650
Hey, are you ready?

271
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,190
Let's go out!

272
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,410
I'm sorry. I can't go...

273
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,410
Why? You said there's a place
you wanna go, didn't you?

274
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,460
But if I do something like that,

275
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,920
it's going to cause a lot of trouble
for everybody in the palace!

276
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,170
If I stayed here for 10 years, I'd go crazy!

277
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,220
It's in return for the
food - I'm coming with you!

278
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,260
Where do you want to go?

279
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,600
Well...

280
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,110
The Sea...

281
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,280
The Sea...

282
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
The Sea Forest!

283
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,580
No but it's just a dream.

284
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,500
I can't do such a selfish thing,
I can't just go out...

285
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,050
Why are you crying just from
saying where you wanna go?!

286
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,600
I-I'm sorry. It's because I
summoned all my courage to say it.

287
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,890
Please don't get mad!
You are scaring me, Luffy-sama!

288
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,230
You're such a pain in the butt!

289
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,520
What is that? That was so loud!

290
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,150
Is he throwing something again?

291
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,950
What a sick guy!

292
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,750
What's this?

293
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,210
What's this noise-jamon?
Don't tell me it's Decken again!

294
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,590
It's coming from the Hard Shell Tower-jamon!
Shirahoshi must be in danger!

295
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,130
Are there guards with her?!

296
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,930
No, they're all tied up here!

297
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,010
What?!

298
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:48,480
Hey, pirates! Go see if the Princess is okay!

299
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,520
Huh? What are you talking about?

300
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,070
Neptune-sama! Then they'll
find out about the Princess!

301
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,820
We have no choice-jamon!

302
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:03,660
The Hard Shell Tower is on the northeast
side of the palace! You guys, go there now!

303
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,790
Why are we being ordered
around by our hostages?!

304
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,000
Silence! Shirahoshi is
my only daughter-jamon!

305
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,170
Somebody is trying to kill her constantly!

306
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:20,340
If something happens to my daughter,
I'll shove you all off the end of an ocean trench!

307
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,310
So she is the Mermaid Princess, am I right?!

308
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,350
Then I'll go there as soon as possible!

309
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,810
And...

310
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,820
...can I ask her to show me her panties?

311
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,230
Hey wait, Brook!

312
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:44,450
Oh, I can't take it! He's heading
there with lascivious intent!

313
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,580
Now she's in a different kind of danger!

314
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:52,040
Wait, Skeleton! You don't have
to untie me but take me with you!

315
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,080
I have jurisdiction over the tower!

316
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,670
If something happened to the Princess,
I would be beside myself with regret!

317
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,730
I assume... you...

318
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,520
...wanna see her too!

319
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,940
--Don't be ridiculous!
--How lecherous!

320
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,860
He's wrong!

321
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,240
Sanji-san, excuse me for seeing her first!

322
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,250
I've always wanted to go to the Sea Forest.

323
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,710
For this 10 years.

324
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,260
But everybody is kind enough to tell me that
it's too dangerous to go out of the tower.

325
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,220
And I am scared of going out, too!

326
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,980
Luffy-sama, are you really
going to take me out of here?

327
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
Uh-huh.

328
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,560
Are you really going to protect me?

329
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,400
Count on me! You're gonna be fine!

330
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,700
Whoa-whoa, I'm not gonna take you if you cry.

331
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,540
Plus, to be accurate,
you take me since I can't swim.

332
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,710
I-I am so sorry. I am too delighted...

333
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,970
You really are a crybaby and a coward.

334
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,720
But once you go out,
everybody will recognize you.

335
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,770
Yes, I'm sorry.

336
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,350
So I have an idea!

337
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,610
Mermaid Princess?! Are you alright?!

338
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,870
Hey, Skeleton! Look at the tower!

339
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,750
I can't believe this!
Those aren't knives or axes like usual!

340
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,010
It was the sound of human
pirates hitting the tower!

341
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,430
How eccentric! He's not normal,
that man - Vander Decken!

342
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,140
Huh?! V-Vander Decken?!

343
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,900
Oh, this is no good!
They're getting on their feet!

344
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,940
Does this mean that the
impregnable Ryugu Palace...

345
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,780
...has been invaded by enemy forces?!

346
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,160
This is a surprise attack!
The King is in danger!

347
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,620
The Princess is in danger!

348
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,920
The attack stopped, huh?

349
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,630
Let's go, Coward!

350
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,300
Y-Yes! We are ready, Megalo!

351
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,940
Go, Shark!

352
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,610
Megalo?!

353
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,200
Luffy-san?!

354
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,950
To the Sea Forest!

355
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,960
When Shirahoshi is discovered missing,
the Ryugu Palace is thrown into a panic.

356
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,630
Furthermore, a group of unknown
pirates have infiltrated the palace.

357
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,970
These pirates seem driven to attack
the Straw Hats at all costs.

358
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,140
Meanwhile, in Coral Hill, a critically
wounded Hachi appears before Sanji and Chopper!

359
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,870
"The Ryugu Palace in Shock!
The Kidnapping of Shirahoshi!"

361
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
