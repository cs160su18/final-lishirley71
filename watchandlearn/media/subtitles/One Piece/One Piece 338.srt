2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,810
It isn't night yet, but with this thick fog,

48
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,560
it's creepy how dark it is.

49
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,230
Yep! Don't let your guard down.

50
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,940
From the looks of it, we're already
caught in the infamous...

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,860
...Florian Triangle!

52
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,490
These seas are haunted!

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,420
♪ Yo ho ho ho ♪

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,800
--One appeared!
--♪ Yo ho ho ho ♪

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,970
It's a ghost ship!

56
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,890
♪ We're on our way... ♪

57
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,360
♪ ...to deliver Bink's booze ♪

58
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,570
I bet he's the treasure's guardian!
Let's go look for him.

59
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,150
H-Huh?

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,160
No!

61
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,990
You gave me quite a start!

62
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,620
How many decades have passed
since I saw people in the flesh?

63
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,130
Putting that aside...

64
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,000
...join my crew!

65
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,300
Yeah, okay.

66
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,880
Hey!

67
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,730
"The Joy of Seeing People!
The Gentleman Skeleton's True Identity!"

68
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,320
Hi! Hello, everyone! Good day to you.

69
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,160
I shall be imposing upon
you here on your vessel!

70
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,750
I am the dead and skeletonized Brook.
It's a pleasure to meet you!

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,210
Don't be stupid! And what the heck is he?!

72
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,040
My, my! They're harsh!

73
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,050
It's a skeleton!

74
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,970
Goodness, aren't you a lovely lady?
May I please see your panties?

75
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,520
Stop that, Harassment Skeleton!

76
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,770
Armed... and... ready!

77
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,770
"Evil Be Gone"

78
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,270
Tada!

79
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,240
You're fully decked out in anti-evil stuff!

80
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,620
S-Stupid skeleton! B-Beat it already!

81
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,910
Evil be gone! Evil be gone!

82
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,700
H-Hey...

83
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,660
Wow, it's working! Usopp, that's amazing!

84
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,420
"Evil Be Gone"

85
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,250
You know it! This is my full
"Anti-Evil Spirit Arsenal."

86
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,590
An evil spirit?! Where? Where is it?

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,550
--It's you!
--What?!

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,760
Damn it! There's no way a skeleton
can walk, talk, and grow an afro!

89
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,890
This is a dream! It has to be a dream!

90
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,200
Really?!

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,190
Phew! It's just a dream...

92
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,440
Hello? Please wake up.

93
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,940
Good morning.

94
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,780
Shuddup!

95
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,410
Hey, Luffy! What's up with this guy?

96
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,870
Isn't he funny? I had him join our crew.

97
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,700
No, you didn't! I won't allow it!

98
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,620
Do you know why you went with him?!

99
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,670
It was to keep Luffy from
doing anything crazy!

100
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,020
We're ashamed of ourselves...

101
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,790
Now, don't get so worked up.

102
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,090
Come on inside! Let's have dinner.

103
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,050
That's not for you to decide!

104
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,060
You're funny!

105
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,560
Honestly, you have a splendid
dining room! And that kitchen!

106
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,270
This is all so wonderful!

107
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,780
Isn't it?

108
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,530
You bet it is! It was made
by someone as super as me!

109
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,910
Man, you've got a pretty keen eye.

110
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,620
Hey! Don't get all chummy with him, Franky.

111
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,210
But I can't wait to eat!

112
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,960
I haven't had a decent meal in decades.

113
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,750
I've had to endure terrible agony every day

114
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,970
as the skin on my belly caved
in until it touched my back!

115
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,170
But since I'm a skeleton, I don't
have any skin on my belly or back!

116
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,850
It's a skull joke!

117
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,970
A skull joke!

118
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,360
As a gentleman, I adore the laid-back
time spent while waiting for my meal.

119
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,530
--Dinner, yay! Dinner! C'mon, baby!
--Food! Food! Food! Food!

120
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,830
Chef! For my drink, I'll take milk.

121
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,790
Shut up! Wait quietly!

122
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,710
Before I forget, Kroobuckle...

123
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,290
No, I'm Brook.

124
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,260
Um, actually, you'll have to forgive me,
but I still don't know your name...

125
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,970
Me? I'm Luffy.

126
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,550
So before I forget, what exactly are you?

127
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,520
Just how little do you
know about each other?!

128
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,850
All right, it's ready!

129
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,480
Help yourselves. We can
kick the skeleton out later.

130
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,480
For now, enjoy the meal!
I used up all the octopi.

131
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,900
Looks good!

132
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,740
Hey, Brook! Eat all you want!

133
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,910
Sanji's an awesome cook!

134
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,110
But... my heart feels full
instead of my stomach...

135
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,460
You're...

136
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,840
Miss, you seem to have gotten a bit more.

137
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,560
Would you mind if we swapped plates?

138
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,550
There's extra, so eat your own!

139
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,390
Aw dese octopuses were awive in da
aquaweeam undil naw too wong ago!

140
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,270
They were alive until just
recently in the aquarium?

141
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,850
Your ship has its own aquarium?

142
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,150
You bether beweeb it! Fwanky made
dis swip and it hash evewyding!

143
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,150
It truly is an amazing ship!
I've never seen one like it before.

144
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,870
Wanna deck it ow wader?

145
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Yes, I'd love to take a tour!

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
How could he understand that?

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,090
It rocks! Yay! Show it off! C'mon!

148
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,130
Eat quietly!

149
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,210
The Revive-Revive Fruit?

150
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,460
I figured a Devil Fruit was behind this.

151
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,920
Indeed, it is.

152
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,720
To be honest, I have already
died once, decades ago.

153
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,890
Wipe your face first! How'd you
manage to get food all over yourself?

154
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,190
The Revive-Revive Fruit lets you...

155
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,730
...come back to life.

156
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,570
In other words, I'm a revived human.

157
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,360
It guarantees the mysterious
power of a second shot at life.

158
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,320
A revived human!

159
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
So it gave you the power to come
back to life once after dying?

160
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,080
Yeah, that's right.

161
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,030
Oh, excuse me.

162
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,170
And a long time ago,
I was a pirate just like you!

163
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,170
You're a fellow pirate?

164
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,210
That's right. Oh, pardon me.

165
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,970
I wish I could beat some manners into you.

166
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,150
Long, long ago, my crewmates and I

167
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,320
sailed into the Devil's Sea
on the ship you saw earlier.

168
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,120
However, we had the misfortune of running
into some terribly powerful pirates.

169
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,870
Our entire crew was
annihilated in the battle.

170
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,790
Naturally, I died with them.

171
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,790
When I was alive, the Revive-Revive's
only power was that I couldn't swim.

172
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,720
But on that day, the Fruit's
power finally took effect!

173
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,270
My soul returned from the Underworld!

174
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,340
My soul should have quickly returned
to my body, thus reviving me!

175
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,000
But I died on the Devil's Sea and as
you can see, it is dreadfully foggy.

176
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,500
So I got lost!

177
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,780
My soul wandered through
the fog for an entire year.

178
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,930
I finally managed to find my body!

179
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,710
But by then, it had already turned
into a pearly white skeleton!

180
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,070
I was so surprised that my eyes
nearly popped out of my head.

181
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,430
Not that I have any eyeballs!

182
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,550
What a moron! You're just like Zoro.

183
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,960
Watch it!

184
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,380
And that's how you became a talking skeleton?

185
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,130
It's scary how the Devil's Fruit
still brought you back

186
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,960
even though you're just a skeleton...

187
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,380
But now that the Fruit has done its job,

188
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,170
isn't it just stealing your ability to swim?

189
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,470
That's practically a curse!

190
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,480
And skeletons normally
don't have hair, do they?

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,130
Who ever heard of a skeleton with an afro?

192
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,450
I had strong roots.

193
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,270
I don't really care.

194
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,490
So you aren't a ghost?
You're actually a human?

195
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,490
No, you aren't quite human anymore...

196
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,200
Anyway, you aren't a ghost, right?

197
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,660
Right! I hate ghosts!

198
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,200
I'll start screaming if I see one.

199
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,170
You hate ghosts? Have you ever
taken a look in the mirror?

200
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,510
No! Please put that mirror away!

201
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,010
What's wrong?

202
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,340
Wh-Whoa! T-Time out!

203
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,130
W-Why...

204
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,010
Why doesn't the mirror show your reflection?!

205
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,190
He's a vampire!

206
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,310
Really?! That's awesome!

207
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,570
N-Now that I take a closer look,
you don't have a shadow!

208
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,240
You're right! What are you, really?

209
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,710
Don't soothe yourself!

210
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,460
We're freaking out! And it's your fault!

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,670
I have spent far too many
years drifting on these seas

212
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,840
to tell my story in one sitting.

213
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,660
The story behind why I am a skeleton

214
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,720
and the story behind why I lack a
shadow are completely unrelated.

215
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,770
To be continued.

216
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,230
Tell us now!

217
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,470
A certain man stole my
shadow a few years ago.

218
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
It was stolen?

219
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,360
Your shadow?

220
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,580
After seeing you move and talk,
nothing could surprise me.

221
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
But does that sorta thing actually happen?

222
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,840
Yes, it does.

223
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,630
And having lost my shadow, I am no
longer able to exist in the world of light.

224
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,250
But aren't you alive?

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,590
No, I cannot live under the light of the sun.

226
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,890
I'm only alive now because I avoid the
sunlight here on these foggy waters.

227
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,520
What would happen if you
were hit by the sunlight?

228
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,020
If I was directly hit by sunlight, my body...

229
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,400
...would be obliterated!

230
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,590
If I was directly hit by sunlight,
my body would be obliterated!

231
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,640
Obliterated?!

232
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,980
Right...

233
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,780
I have witnessed someone who lost his shadow

234
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,180
disappear under the light of the sun.

235
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,540
It was truly terrifying!
A hair-raising sight to behold!

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,360
And here I'm a skeleton!

237
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,920
Your shadow appears on the ground
when you stand in the light.

238
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,220
Since I lack a shadow,
my body cannot reflect light.

239
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,080
That's why I cannot be seen
in mirrors or pictures.

240
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,310
In other words, the light
rejects my very existence!

241
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,190
And my crewmates are all dead!

242
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,480
Your life sucks!

243
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,150
Even so, I've scraped by!

244
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,900
Scraped down to the bone!

245
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,320
I am the dead and skeletonized
Brook. It's a pleasure!

246
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,030
Why are you so cheerful?

247
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,710
"Evil Be Gone"

248
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,710
H-Hey! What's wrong? You okay?

249
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:12,260
Today is truly a wonderful day! I met people!

250
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,010
Is it today or tomorrow?

251
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,930
On these dark, foggy seas, I can't tell
when one day moves to the next...

252
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,170
All of my crewmates passed away...

253
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,300
I was all alone on a large ship
with a broken rudder...

254
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,180
I merely rocked on the water
as I drifted for several decades.

255
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,140
I was really lonely!

256
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,330
I was lonely! And scared!

257
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,690
"Evil Be Gone"

258
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,480
I wanted to die!

259
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,610
But I'm glad I've lived such a long life.

260
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,570
People are joy!

261
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,530
I see you as "joy"!

262
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
If only my tears hadn't gone dry,
so I could shed tears of joy!

263
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,830
You invited me to join your crew, didn't you?

264
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,120
That made me truly happy! Thank you!

265
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,760
But I'm afraid I must turn your offer down.

266
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,630
Eh?! Why?!

267
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,800
As I just explained, my
shadow has been stolen.

268
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,510
I cannot live under the sun.

269
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,640
I'm currently protected by the fog that

270
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,730
blocks the sunlight here in the Devil's Sea.

271
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,800
But if I left with you, it would be a matter

272
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,000
of time before my body was obliterated.

273
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,220
I will stay here and wait

274
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,910
for the miraculous day
when I reclaim my shadow!

275
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,620
Don't act like such a stranger!

276
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,330
If you need your shadow,
I'll take it back for you!

277
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,250
Didn't you say someone stole it?
Who was it? Where is he?

278
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,750
You're a really great guy...

279
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm surprised! However, I cannot tell you.

280
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,890
I could not ask you to die
for me when we've just met!

281
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,640
Meaning the foe's too strong?

282
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,820
It wouldn't kill you!
At least give us a name.

283
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,110
No, my lips are sealed.

284
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,900
Honestly, I don't know where he is.

285
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,950
I don't even know if I'll see him again
before my second life comes to an end.

286
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:50,000
But if our paths should ever cross,
I have decided to fight him!

287
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,560
Putting that aside...

288
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,260
...let's sing!

289
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,440
Instruments are my pride and joy.

290
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,150
I was a musician on my pirate ship.

291
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,780
Really?! You're a musician?

292
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Please! Join my crew, moron!

293
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,780
Let's enjoy a fun sailor song!

294
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,960
No!

295
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,300
Hey! What is it? What's wrong?

296
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,260
G... G-G-G...

297
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,720
Ghost!

298
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,760
Gah! Something's there!

299
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,260
Evil be gone! Evil be gone!

300
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,350
I'm scared! It's a ghost!

301
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,640
Awesome!

302
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,460
It's running away!

303
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,730
Wh-What's causing that tremor?!

304
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
I-It couldn't be!

305
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,240
How horrible!

306
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,200
This ship was already under observation.

307
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,500
Come look! They've blocked
the path in front of you.

308
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,220
This is what caused that tremor!

309
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,670
What is that?

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,510
H-Hey, did a sea monster gobble us up?

311
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,840
What's going on?

312
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,930
This is the back of the gate.

313
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,140
The gate...?

314
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,560
Which means...

315
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,180
Let's look out the aft!

316
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,240
What's going on?

317
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,080
By any chance, did you pick up a
drifting barrel while out at sea?

318
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,540
"Offering of Treasure to the Sea God"

319
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,540
Something's floating on the water.

320
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,840
"Treasure"

321
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,840
You're right! Maybe a treasure
ship accidentally dropped it!

322
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,000
Cool, it opened!

323
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,890
What's that?

324
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,350
We found one.

325
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,560
I knew it! That was a trap.

326
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,610
They've been after your ship ever since then.

327
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,270
What do you mean by that?

328
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,360
Our ship has been here this whole time...

329
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,620
So how'd an island get there?

330
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,200
This is the ghost island
that wanders the seas...

331
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,560
...Thriller Bark!

332
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,490
Thriller Bark...

333
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,590
Where the heck did that skeleton go?
H-Hey, shouldn't you slow down, Nami?

334
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,620
Don't underestimate my navigation technique!
I'm gonna let her rip!

335
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,970
N-Nami, I don't think there's
any water over there!

336
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,610
Of course there--what?!

337
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

338
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,520
"One Unnatural Phenomenon After the Next!
Disembarking on Thriller Bark!"

339
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,470
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
