00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,020
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,650
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,570
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,450
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,290
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil

80
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,000
and involved in an all-out war!

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,590
Now, set off the fireworks!

82
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,470
Okay, I cut you already.

83
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,510
Quinto Tierce Fantasia!

84
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,890
Mil Fleurs...

85
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,940
...Gigantesco Mano...

86
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,690
...Stomp!

87
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,410
The Soldier Dock System!

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
Channel 4!

89
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,670
FR-U 4!

90
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,170
I'll take care of it!

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,430
The new number! Channel 5!

92
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,230
Brachio-Tank 5 is here!

93
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,610
Come on out, Kraken!

94
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,360
There are only 10 of them!
Just crush them all!

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,820
Then it'll finally be over!

96
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,250
Oh, hey, Surume!

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,500
It's me! Surume!

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,340
The Kraken betrayed us!

99
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,720
Listen, Surume! Stay here
and protect Yowahoshi!

100
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,350
Um, thank you for doing this, Surume-sama!

101
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:53,160
"Iron Pirate!
Here Comes General Franky!"

102
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,380
They're pushing their luck too far!

103
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,420
I'll make them pay for this!

104
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,860
Where am I?

105
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,360
You're in Conchcorde Plaza.
Don't you remember?

106
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,600
Looks like they have some good swordsmen!

107
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,730
Get out of my way!

108
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,730
Don't cut me! Hyouzou-san!

109
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,950
Get away!

110
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,540
Run!

111
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,710
Oh? What's going on?

112
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,170
They're trying to escape from us!

113
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,930
I guess they're scared of us!

114
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,470
Let's take out their
officers while they're gone!

115
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,980
Yeah! Advance!

116
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,280
There is one of them right in front of us!

117
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,110
Prepare to fire!

118
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,030
Roger! Preparing to fire!

119
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,580
Oh? He's gone!

120
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,740
Cookie Cutter!

121
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,580
There he is! Prepare to fire!

122
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll get him this time...
Oh, he's gone again!

123
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,960
There! Fire!

124
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,140
What?! Oh, he's gone again!

125
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,300
No, there he is!

126
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,140
Damn! He moves so quickly!

127
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,390
Hey, Commander Chopper!

128
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,320
It's rattling! Is there something wrong?!

129
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,150
What? What?! What?!

130
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,450
It's a sink hole!

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,250
That serves you right!
Special Attack - Daruma Drop!

132
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,250
Ouch!

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,510
I just dug a web of tunnels
underground with my fangs!

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,470
Hey! What happened?!

135
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,140
Usopp! Chopper!

136
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,520
Now, I'm gonna take care
of that stupid biker too...

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,950
Oh no!

138
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,240
A sink hole!

139
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,960
What?! Is he dumb?!

140
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,630
Ow, ow, ow...

141
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,000
Hey! Are you okay, guys?!

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,510
Bastard! Super I won't forgive him!

143
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,510
You guys, get out!

144
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,050
Why?!

145
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,930
Are they splitting up?!

146
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,140
Hey, what are you doing, Franky?!

147
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,730
How dare you kick the commander out!

148
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,030
Because it's gonna turn
into a single-seater!

149
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,530
Let's get perverted!

150
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,280
You're already a pervert!

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,490
Black Rhino FR-U 4!

152
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,220
Stand by!

153
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,060
Oh, it perverted!

154
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,350
That's not it!

155
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,140
Brachio-Tank 5!

156
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,990
Head change!

157
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,290
Brachio-Tank 5!

158
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,170
Black Rhino FR-U 4!

159
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,840
Docking!

160
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,680
What?! Docking?!

161
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,020
Iron Pirate!

162
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,740
General Franky!

163
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,620
Awesome!

164
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,750
What the hell is that?!

165
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,960
Cool!!

166
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,590
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
The transforming robot of our dream!

167
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,780
The mad genius Vegapunk
who I haven't met yet.

168
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,910
I realized his old dream...

169
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,540
...after trial and error
for the last 2 years.

170
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:20,670
By using the shape-memory
alloy called Wapometal,

171
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,630
I finally did it!

172
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,720
D-Don't be intimidated by its looks!

173
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,530
Oh, so strong!!

174
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,160
There is more to come!

175
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,120
Look at this! This is
the "plunderer's sword"!

176
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,460
Franken!

177
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,790
He has a sword!

178
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,340
General...

179
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,720
...Watch-Your-Step!

180
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,010
Striking below the belt!

181
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,350
It's unmanly but effective!

182
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,600
The cannons in these shoulders
will get you while you're jumping!

183
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,810
What?!

184
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,860
What?! Cannons in its shoulders?!

185
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,860
Franky Cannon!

186
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh, the cannons are in your shoulders!

187
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,210
--But...
--But...

188
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,250
--...you're so cool!
--Oh yeah!

189
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,630
Oh, how awesome!

190
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,560
Dammit!

191
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,720
He's so tricky!

192
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,810
I've got more new weapons!

193
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,400
Watch out!

194
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,280
Come on! New weapons!

195
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,450
General...

196
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,120
...Weight!

197
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,490
It's so heavy!

198
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,410
--You're so cool, General!
--Weight! Weight!

199
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,250
What's so cool about that?

200
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,540
Oh!

201
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,340
Here is a weak one!

202
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,850
How dare you say I'm
weak! I'm just a chicken!

203
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,270
Sorcery Climate Baton!

204
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,600
Watch out for a gust of wind.

205
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,860
Gust Sword!

206
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,870
Do you understand now?

207
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,040
It's Weatheria's science of weather!

208
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,880
Don't underestimate it!

209
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Oh? Huh?

210
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,070
Where did Chopper go?

211
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,240
Let's get that guy!

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,330
Damn! I got kicked out of the tank after all!

213
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,160
I have no other choice but to fight.

214
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,750
But I'm not scared!

215
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,340
Because I'm not the same
person that I used to be!

216
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,880
Special Attack - Green Star!

217
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,470
Bamboo Javelin!

218
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,230
Master Heracles'n!

219
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:13,320
I'll never forget those 2 years that I
spent in the deadly Swindling Forest!

220
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,030
It begins now!

221
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:22,660
The second chapter of "The
Adventures of the Real Man Usopp"!

222
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,500
I'll make sink holes all over the plaza!

223
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,800
Doesn't matter if it's a cool robot or
something else! Once it falls down, it's all over!

224
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,470
What is that?!

225
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,850
Somebody else is digging too!

226
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,410
Daruma-san got blown out!

227
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,330
Wh-Who is it?!

228
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,130
It's me!

229
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,350
Horn Boost!

230
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm good at digging too!

231
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,560
Chopper!

232
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,440
Cool! You can turn into a stag beetle now?!

233
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,070
It's not a stag beetle!

234
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:38,530
I strengthened 7 of my transformation
boosts in the last 2 years!

235
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,410
I only need the Rumble
Ball for just one boost now!

236
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,620
So I can turn into any other
forms whenever I want!

237
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,710
What a pain-in-the-ass coral guy!

238
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,960
I'll bite your flesh off!

239
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,670
These are not coral - they're horns!

240
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,720
And I'm a pain-in-the-ass monster for you!

241
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,140
They all seem so full of
life when they're fighting!

242
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,560
Like they've been waiting
to fight for so long!

243
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,830
How many of them have we killed?

244
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,710
N-None, sir.

245
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,600
Kraken!

246
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,310
Good job, considering it was you.

247
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:59,070
You gained their favor so
slickly and caught Shirahoshi!

248
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,320
Now, squeeze her to death!

249
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,330
Your brother at the North Pole...

250
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,380
I know exactly where he is.

251
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,010
We can just go there and
kill him whenever we want.

252
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,510
You brothers are mythical creatures.

253
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,720
Even dead, I can sell you for a good price.

254
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,690
Don't tell me that's what you want.

255
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,020
Kraken?

256
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,860
I can't believe this.

257
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,490
He was obeying Hordy because his
brother was taken as a hostage!

258
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,330
I'll tell you one last time!

259
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,920
Squeeze Shirahoshi to death!

260
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,680
Huh?

261
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,220
Surume-sama, y-you're hurting me!

262
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,690
Surume!

263
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,740
So you were doing everything he says
in order to save your brother's life?

264
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,920
I know how you feel.

265
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,300
Is it your younger brother or older brother?

266
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,220
Let me try to save his life too!

267
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,300
Did you forget?

268
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,180
I'm your friend!

269
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,200
Surume-sama!

270
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,790
Straw Hat is coming this way!

271
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,170
Kill him!

272
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,010
You guys are no match for him-dogon!

273
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,800
Let us take care of him-ch!

274
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,150
Straw Hat!

275
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,610
We won't let you come any
closer to our captain-ch!

276
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,320
Drop dead!

277
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,780
We won't let you guys...

278
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,370
...Get in his way!

279
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,960
Stop Straw Hat!

280
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,920
Second Gear!

281
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,420
Where did he go?!

282
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,210
What?!

283
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,730
I don't know why but I'm full of fight now!

284
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,520
Awesome!

285
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,400
How did he get there?! I couldn't see him!

286
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,490
That's...!

287
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,820
I can't believe it!

288
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,950
That's...

289
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,330
...the Ship of Promise!

290
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,160
"Noah"!

291
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,630
As Luffy and Hordy begin their battle,

292
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,300
suddenly, directly above
the Conchcorde Plaza,

293
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,260
the massive form of Noah appears
and terrifies the citizens.

294
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,760
As everyone begins to lose hope,

295
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,140
Shirahoshi places herself in front
of the Noah to save Fish-Man Island.

296
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

297
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,690
"The Noah Closing in! The Fish-Man
Island Facing Destruction!"

298
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
