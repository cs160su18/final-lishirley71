Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,860
It's coming!
Shoot it, quickly! Shoot it!

22
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,200
Grandpa Ryu!

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,710
Grandpa Ryu! Hang in there!

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,810
Grandpa Ryu!

25
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,370
"Through the Sky They Soar!
The 1,000-Year Legend Lives Again!"

26
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,860
Hang in there!

27
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,100
What happened to going
to the dragons' nest?!

28
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,540
Try hard to live!

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,240
Grandpa Ryu...

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,170
Grandpa Ryu!

31
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,500
Damn those guys!

32
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,920
This is bad!

33
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,200
Yeah. He can't swim, huh?

34
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,720
Whew, what a scare...

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,310
It suddenly came right for me...

36
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,280
Commodore! The Millennial
Dragon is starting to sink!

37
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,220
Don't fret! We'll still make it in time!

38
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,490
Fire a harpoon and drag it in!

39
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,090
Target the Millennial Dragon!

40
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,300
Okay! Fire!

41
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,450
Yes, sir!

42
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,190
What?!

43
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,990
What are you doing?!

44
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,730
You've no idea of the value of the
thing you're standing on right now!

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,330
All I want are the
Millennial Dragon's bones!

46
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,840
Once I have its Dragonite,
I can attain everlasting life!

47
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,550
Why, you...!

48
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,040
Grandpa Ryu isn't a thing!
He's our friend!

49
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,880
He's a dear friend
who's on a journey with us!

50
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,030
What utter nonsense!

51
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,210
In that case, you can sink
into the sea with your friend!

52
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,700
How dare you try to harpoon me?!

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,040
Fire at that brat!

54
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,520
B-But, if we do that, we'll blow
the Millennial Dragon up, too!

55
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,260
No matter!
Bone fragments will do just fine!

56
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,660
Y-Yes, sir! Aim the
sub-cannons out to sea!

57
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,390
Yes, sir!

58
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,780
You're fine staying here?!
What kind of wimpiness is that?!

59
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,710
You still haven't
accomplished your goal!

60
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,640
What happened to going to your nest?!

61
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,910
Don't give up by saying
you're staying here!

62
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,580
Of course I will!
Don't worry about Apis!

63
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,760
Just think about yourself now!

64
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,980
Untie these ropes!

65
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,330
--I gotta go to Grandpa Ryu!
--What's that?!

66
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,110
I gotta save Grandpa Ryu!

67
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,060
L-Leave Grandpa Ryu to Luffy!

68
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,060
No, no, no!
I gotta go! I gotta go!

69
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,180
If anyone, he'll manage somehow!

70
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,110
The entire sea is shaking!

71
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,410
What is this?! What's happening?!

72
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,830
What the...?!

73
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,880
What the...?! What the...?!

74
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,430
Grandpa Ryu!

75
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,320
Really?

76
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,520
So that's it!

77
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,900
What is happening?!

78
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,650
There shouldn't be any underwater
volcanoes in these waters!

79
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,580
No matter! Fire! Fire! Fire!

80
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,820
I see!

81
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,400
You have dear friends of your own, too!

82
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,560
Grandpa Ryu!

83
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,770
What's he bellowing for?

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,170
He's calling...

85
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,880
Calling?

86
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,230
He's telling Millennial Dragons
all around the world that it's "time"...

87
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,230
It's "time"?

88
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,850
What's that mean?

89
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,770
Hey! W-What's that?!

90
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,620
S-So many Millennial Dragons!

91
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,460
These're Grandpa Ryu's friends!

92
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,640
Yeah!

93
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,680
What the...?!

94
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,210
Where the hell'd they come from?

95
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,680
T-Those are...!

96
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,430
Dragonite!
It's a mother lode of Dragonite!

97
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,390
Shoot them! Shoot them down!

98
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,160
W-We can't! Our cannons
can't reach that high!

99
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,330
Grandpa Ryu!

100
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,340
Yeah! I know!
I promise I'll tell Apis!

101
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,830
Gum-Gum...

102
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,460
...Rocket!

103
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,370
Gonna borrow your neck!

104
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,880
...And...

105
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,290
...Battle-Axe!

106
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,760
What?!

107
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,030
What was that?!

108
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,980
What was that?!

109
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,290
The commodore's been beaten!

110
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,920
Troops sure are weak once
their bosses are taken out.

111
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,250
Are they just gonna reel in
their chains and run away?

112
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,830
We better get goin' too.

113
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,100
They're circling around...
What's going on?

114
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,590
Hey! Let's go!

115
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,880
Yeah!

116
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,500
The chains!

117
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,010
You idiots! What're you doing?!

118
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,030
We're gonna crash!

119
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,560
That's really somethin'!

120
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,250
Nami-san! I'm back!

121
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,880
Just get on already!

122
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,820
Where's Luffy?

123
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,060
Gum-Gum...

124
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,560
...Rocket!

125
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,670
Sorry to bother you again!

126
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,380
Yo!

127
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,440
Don't give me, "Yo!"

128
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,710
Can't you come back more quietly?!
You're gonna wreck the ship!

129
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,760
Grandpa Ryu...

130
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,410
An earthquake?

131
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,210
Again?!

132
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,820
Grandpa Ryu...

133
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,980
I wasn't able to keep my
promise to you, Grandpa Ryu...

134
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,460
I wasn't able to take
you to the dragons' nest...

135
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,350
No, Grandpa Ryu's wish came true.

136
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,660
Can't you hear the
Millennial Dragons' voices?

137
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,790
W-What the...?!

138
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,230
What's with these earthquakes?!

139
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,440
T-This one's big!

140
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,260
Hey! Look!

141
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,630
T-The sea's pulling way back!

142
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,230
So that's what it meant!

143
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,300
What is it, Nami-san?!

144
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,870
The dragons' nest really is here!

145
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,960
They're not called "Millennial Dragons"
because of their life spans!

146
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,620
It's because they come to this
island only once every 1,000 years!

147
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,920
Millennial Dragons are migratory!

148
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,440
And it's by no coincidence that
they've all flocked here now!

149
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,380
It's no wonder they call it Lost Island!

150
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,730
Because it only surfaces
once every 1,000 years!

151
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,640
So of course no one today
remembers the last time it surfaced!

152
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,670
And now... this very moment...

153
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,040
...is when the dragons' nest has appeared!

154
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,260
Whoa...

155
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,030
Say, is that what I think it is?

156
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,610
Yeah! It must be the dragon nest
Grandpa Ryu wanted to go back to!

157
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,750
This is?

158
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,450
H-Hey! Apis!

159
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,810
Apis!

160
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,000
Why'd she suddenly run off?

161
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,140
Grandpa Ryu.

162
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,560
Grandpa Ryu is here...

163
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,090
Grandpa Ryu!

164
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,380
Grandpa Ryu!

165
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,520
Grandpa Ryu!

166
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,190
Grandpa Ryu!

167
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,710
Just by coincidence,
the place Grandpa Ryu sunk

168
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,820
was where the dragons' nest was...

169
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,350
Do you suppose that might
help him rest in peace better?

170
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,790
It's okay! He said his wish
came true when he was sinking!

171
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,990
So this is the dragons' nest?
Look at all these weird rocks...

172
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,960
I think they're probably
made of Dragonite...

173
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,170
Huh?!

174
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,670
Look at this rock here.
Doesn't it look just like a dragon?

175
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,230
Oh, now that you mention it...

176
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,090
But why are the rocks dragons?

177
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,620
Because they were on the ocean floor
for a thousand long years.

178
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,550
The materials in their bodies fossilized.

179
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,830
Oh, I see!

180
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,630
Do you really get it?

181
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,860
Nope! Not at all!

182
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,490
They say when elephants are about to die,

183
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,590
they hide themselves
in their elephant graveyard.

184
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,030
Maybe the same is true here.
This might be a dragon graveyard...

185
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,270
A dragon graveyard?

186
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,490
No! It's not!

187
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,160
Grandpa Ryu said going back
to his nest would make him better!

188
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,670
This can't be a graveyard!

189
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,680
Apis...

190
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,140
Grandpa Ryu was
a lost Millennial Dragon...

191
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Luffy?

192
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,660
He was all alone,
for a thousand years...

193
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,880
But he made friends with you, Apis.

194
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,260
He said out of the
1,000 years he was alive,

195
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,430
this last year with
you was his happiest.

196
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,840
Luffy... You understand
the dragons' language?

197
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,360
I just somehow know.

198
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,410
Geez, talk about half-baked...

199
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,930
But there's no doubt about it!

200
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,370
You liar...

201
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,460
You're such a liar, Grandpa Ryu!

202
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,570
If this is the dragons' nest...

203
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,940
If you've made it back
to the dragons' nest,

204
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,460
then open your eyes again!

205
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,550
Talk to me!

206
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,020
Get better!

207
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,660
Grandpa Ryu wasn't lying at all!

208
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,950
He said that Millennial Dragons
return to the nest every 1,000 years

209
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,230
and are reborn again.

210
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,260
Grandpa Ryu said that?

211
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,650
There!

212
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,850
A baby Millennial Dragon?!

213
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,910
Yeah!

214
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,510
Yeah! Yeah!

215
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,390
You know, Apis.

216
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,260
This isn't just a
Millennial Dragon graveyard.

217
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,790
I think it's a place
that connects to new life.

218
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,040
Thank you, everyone!

219
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,010
Eh?

220
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,770
For bringing Grandpa Ryu
back to the dragons' nest.

221
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,560
I realize it now, too.

222
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,810
I realize what kind of place this is,

223
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,660
and why Grandpa Ryu
wanted to return here so badly.

224
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,210
Apis...

225
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,790
It's an amazing place, isn't it?

226
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,450
Now I understand why my ancestors
went so far as to build a temple...

227
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,480
Thank you, Luffy!

228
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,900
Okay! Let's go back to the village!

229
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,280
Everyone there must be worried,
and probably surprised, too!

230
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,830
Yeah!

231
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,540
Alright!

232
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,240
Let's hurry back to the ship
and leave the island!

233
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,090
Yeah!

234
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,320
Whew, I'm starving!

235
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Sanji! Make me some food!

236
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
--Yeah!
--Meat! Make meat!

237
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,590
I'll have sautéed veggies
with lots of bean sprouts!

238
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,220
Where've I heard that before?

239
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,660
Man, these rocks are cool!

240
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,930
These all used to be
Millennial Dragons?

241
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,400
Yeah, it looks that way.

242
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,240
Even if they are Dragonite,
there's no way to extract it like this.

243
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,740
Then the whole elixir
of immortality thing...

244
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,540
...was nothing but a
dream within a dream.

245
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,450
Even if we took these
coral-covered fossils back with us,

246
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,160
we'd never get an elixir from them.

247
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,920
Yeah, huh?

248
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,100
Meaning those Navy bastards
did all that work for nothing.

249
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,090
Fools! As if I would ever
kick the bucket so easily!

250
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,100
I must pay you back
for what you've done!

251
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,570
But first...!

252
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Millennial Dragons!

253
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,020
With this many, I can have
all the Dragonite I want!

254
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,850
Move.

255
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,750
Eric! Look!
A flock of Millennial Dragons!

256
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I'll pay you money!
What do you say to another deal?!

257
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,500
We can make elixirs of immortality
from living Millennial Drag--!

258
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,920
Get out of my way!

259
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

260
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

261
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,670
I'll set off by myself,

262
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,630
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

263
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,400
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

264
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,490
Why is it so hot?

265
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:55,490
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

266
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

267
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

268
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

269
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

270
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,100
That's Eric!

271
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,360
Man, he's stubborn!

272
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,160
I'll handle him.

273
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,840
No, I will!

274
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,940
Get lost!

275
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,340
Lost Island, huh?
It's sad to leave it now.

276
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Alright! Set sail!

277
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,000
The Grand Line, at last!
Isn't this great?!

278
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,460
Yeah, I can't wait!

279
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,630
There it is!

280
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,870
So that's the Red Line!

281
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

282
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,730
"An Angry Showdown!
Cross the Red Line!"

283
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,910
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
