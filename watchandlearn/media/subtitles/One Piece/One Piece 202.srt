00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome treasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King of
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone dreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen through
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny is
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve your
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,030
Whadya think, old fortress
guy?!I rescued my crew!

18
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,350
♪ We are the Navarone Marines! ♪

19
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,450
♪ We'll show you our fiery spirit! ♪

20
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,640
The special capture operation at Dock 88 is ready!

21
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,090
We can now capture the Straw Hats!

22
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,540
Don't let your guard down.

23
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,350
What do we do, Nami? Do we go there?

24
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,110
Yeah! Let's rely on Dr.
Kobato to lead the way!

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,620
"Breaking Through the Siege!The
Going Merry Is Recovered"

26
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,910
Is this really the right way, Usopp?!

27
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,530
Don't worry! This is
definitely it! Keep moving!

28
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,080
Y-Yeah! Merry's dock was just
around the corner there!

29
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,470
But this seems too easy. I don't like it...

30
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,930
All right! Let's steal our ship back!

31
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,160
Now this is somethin'...

32
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,970
So we were being ambushed!

33
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,690
Sniper Team #7, to the front!

34
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,590
Take aim!

35
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,670
Just like that?!

36
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,120
Gum-Gum...

37
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,530
Fire!

38
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,210
...Balloon!

39
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,800
What are you doing?!

40
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,260
Cannon Team #12, to the front!

41
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,310
Bazookas?!

42
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,480
Fire!

43
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,710
Duds?

44
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,570
Damn, what is this?! My eyes!

45
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,950
I can't see! My eyes are all irritated!

46
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,620
Those were flash bombs!

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,660
Sword Team, to the front!

48
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,500
Charge!

49
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,370
Bastards!

50
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,640
I'm fine!

51
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,980
Oh, that's some nice equipment there.

52
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,970
You can borrow these!

53
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,940
Thanks.

54
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,060
Tatsu-Maki!

55
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,020
Blinders don't work on me,unlike
a certain lovesick moron!

56
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,990
Gum-Gum...

57
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,040
...Gatling!

58
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
And...

59
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,450
...Whip!

60
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,900
What a cinch!

61
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,280
Huh? Where's Sanji and Zoro?

62
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,140
You took care of 'em!

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,350
Oh, sorry.

64
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,740
You dumbass!

65
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,570
Oww...

66
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,190
All right, you dimwitted moron!

67
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,730
What was that you said earlier?!

68
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,310
What the heck are you guys fighting for?!

69
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,450
Fire!

70
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,620
What the--? Crap! I can't get this off!

71
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,980
Luffy!

72
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,620
Stay right where you are!

73
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,420
Your wanted posters say "dead or alive,"

74
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,690
but here at G8, we prefer alive.

75
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,020
But if you resist any further,I
can't guarantee that.

76
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,590
H-Hey, Luffy! Can't you get that net off?!

77
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,260
I can't! It won't come off at all!

78
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,180
Plus I'm suddenly out of strength...

79
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,670
Sea Prism Stone?!

80
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,240
What?!

81
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,470
That's right! That was a Prison Bomb,

82
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,730
meant for use against those with
Devil Fruit powers!

83
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,830
What do you think, Straw Hat?!

84
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,980
I knew he'd come...

85
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,150
What're you doing?!

86
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,860
It's dangerous here! Return to your station!

87
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,780
Don't be such a stick in the mud!

88
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,750
Not good!

89
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,970
Dammit! There's still this many
left,even after all the ones we beat?!

90
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,560
Just give yourselves up.Escape
is absolutely impossible!

91
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,470
All hands, take aim!

92
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,430
Got no choice!

93
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,210
Attack!

94
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,020
What is this?!

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,190
Huh? Was that--?

96
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,130
I'm on the verge of death...

97
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,130
Usopp!

98
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,630
What terrible injuries! He's
badly wounded! The marines did this?!

99
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,150
Damn them!

100
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,350
No, no, no...

101
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,010
Kobato?!

102
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,140
U-Umm, Lt. Commander?

103
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,810
Who are you?!

104
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,130
What's the big idea?!

105
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,700
We've been taken hostage! Please save us!

106
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,540
We were forced here against our will!

107
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,770
Kobato-san?

108
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,840
This giant is one of the pirates!

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,590
Eh?!

110
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,790
W-Wait! When did I do that?!

111
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,840
What is this?!

112
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,710
Who's that other girl?

113
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,790
How should I know?!

114
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,260
"Justice"

115
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,260
Seriously! Huh?! What're you talking about?!

116
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,530
We can't act carelessly with
the hostages there!

117
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,410
Damn that coward! This is why I hate pirates!

118
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,190
That giant was the fake doctor, then?

119
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,140
He has to be! He's carrying his crewmate!

120
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,350
That's right! I'm a rough and
tough member of the Straw Hats!

121
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,900
Even crying babies shut up around me!

122
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,690
Better do as I say, or
these hostages are dead meat!

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,080
All right! Have your men
stand down and let us through!

124
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,660
Now I get it.

125
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,500
Interesting.

126
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,310
Hurry up, or I'll snap
these girls' necks like twigs!

127
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,920
He'll do it, too! He's so
crazy not even we can stop him!

128
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,240
Are you upholders of justice gonna
let two helpless ladies die?

129
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,690
"Justice"

130
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,360
Chopper! That's cowardly! I misjudged you!

131
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,690
You shut up!

132
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,740
He's gonna kill us!

133
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,240
Please, do what he says!

134
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,070
No! No, no!

135
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,470
How many times do I have to say
it?!We have 1,000 mouths to feed!

136
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,650
We have to be efficient to make
it in time! You're too slow!

137
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,630
Oww...

138
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,110
You didn't need to hit us...

139
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,450
What's that? You got a problem?

140
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,150
I'll tell you right now-- save your big talk

141
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,400
until after you've proven yourself to me.

142
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,580
Now come here and help prepare!

143
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,460
Doesn't Jessica-san seem a bit wound up?

144
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,170
I guess the fact that that
cook was a pirate hit her hard...

145
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,500
Not to mention that the real new guys
are losers who're all talk...

146
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,220
That's enough talking there!

147
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,630
Yes! We're sorry!

148
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,970
Here, Billy! Try out my special sauce!

149
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,630
Pretty good, huh?!

150
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,970
Or not...

151
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,950
No, it's good...

152
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,680
But it's our usual flavor, isn't it?

153
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,360
Yes! Exactly!

154
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,760
Ever since I tasted his cooking,I've
felt like we're lacking something.

155
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,360
It's not bad or anything. It's just...

156
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,400
He had flair, I'm sad to say...

157
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,410
Damn it! What did he do differently?!

158
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,080
Jessica-sama.

159
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,860
What?

160
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,630
Could this be of use somehow?

161
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,550
Seems he left some recipe notes
before he left...

162
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,730
That pirate did?!

163
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,840
Recipes for his cooking?!

164
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,470
Oh, come to think of it, he...

165
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,890
I'll write down my recipes for you, then.

166
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,210
What about it?

167
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,020
Eh? Oh, I was hoping--since
he did leave it and all--

168
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,210
that we could maybe use it...

169
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,660
Don't be stupid!

170
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,020
Can you really proudly
call yourselves cooks of Navarone

171
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,330
if you accept help from a pirate?!

172
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,580
Who do you think our marines are
fighting as we speak?!

173
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,780
Don't you have any sense of pride?!

174
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,920
Umm...

175
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,570
Sorry to interrupt, but...

176
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,250
What the hell is this?!

177
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,800
Can't you even peel potatoes right?!

178
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,760
Our men always did it...

179
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,960
And it was always like this...

180
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,920
Listen! This is a battlefield!Even
a single potato is a vital resource!

181
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,120
Even shreds of potato skins are--

182
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,390
U-Uhh...

183
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,120
You two need to start all over with
dishwashing for a while!

184
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,700
Y-Yes, ma'am!

185
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,700
L-Lt. Commander...

186
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,950
I'll pull my men back.

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,460
All hands, lower your weapons and withdraw!

188
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,490
Stand down! All sniper squads,
lower your guns!

189
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,460
Lt. Commander...

190
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,750
We have no choice.

191
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,690
Wow, that worked well.

192
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,950
I hope so...

193
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,090
Huh?

194
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,380
I owe you one, Zoro...

195
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,920
H-Hey! Was that Kobato-san's voice just now?!

196
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,580
Y-You think so too?!

197
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,260
Mechao-san! What's going on?!

198
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,800
Kobato's being held hostage.

199
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,220
Eh?! Isn't that bad?!

200
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,410
Nah, don't worry about it.

201
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,500
I can see whether my daughter's
crying for real or not!

202
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,590
But my main worry...

203
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,920
...is them!

204
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,510
As you can see, we've opened the
way! Now release them!

205
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,440
Yes! It worked!

206
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,690
Hey! Chopper!

207
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,200
No! I'm not letting them go
until we can escape!

208
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,050
Damn you!

209
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,790
I've contacted Squadron
#17,as you ordered, sir.

210
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,270
Good. Have them standby for my signal.

211
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,380
I give in to your demands!
Get onto your ship!

212
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,310
He's a good sport. But
is he telling the truth?

213
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,370
Hey, hold on, you!

214
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,010
Nami. Chopper. Love cook.

215
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,590
Huh?!

216
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,200
Run to the ship on my signal.

217
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,680
Luffy, stretch your arms and get everyone
on board. Can you do that?

218
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,830
No problem...

219
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,070
I see...

220
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,400
Lt. Commander...

221
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,830
It doesn't matter. If anything
happens, I'll take responsibility.

222
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,250
If we let them escape now,all
of G8 will be shamed!

223
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,540
Whoops. Silly me.

224
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,900
What the--?! Don't scare us like that!

225
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,910
N-No!

226
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,480
You fool! He's on your side!

227
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,830
Crap! Nami-san!

228
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,750
Get to the ship somehow!
Let's do it, Captain!

229
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,670
I have no choice! All hands! Attack at once!

230
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,790
I knew that dunderhead would do this!

231
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,830
We have no choice!

232
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,190
Go, long-nose!

233
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,850
Hey, guys! We're gettin' on!

234
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,460
Are they alive?

235
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,780
And now for you and me!

236
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
What?!

237
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,140
Damn them! Don't let them
escape!All squadrons, open fire!

238
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,250
B-But there's still a hostage!

239
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,540
Warning shots are fine!

240
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,350
We did it, Merry!

241
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,550
Why can't you ever rescue us normally?!

242
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,730
That takes its toll on regular people!

243
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,780
All right, everyone! Get up!

244
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,710
Is that the pirate ship?!

245
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,500
What's the deal? Why won't they
order us to attack?!

246
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,280
I hear they have a hostage. Some
nurse they captured.

247
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,240
Pirates sure are nasty!

248
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,520
Oh, is that her?

249
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,250
Whoa, the hostage is giving orders!

250
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,520
This is one hell of a fiasco!Are
the ships ready yet?!

251
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,880
I'm having them hurry!

252
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,940
Dad!

253
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,530
Oh, Kobato.

254
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,760
You've had quite the unusual day!

255
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,970
You released the ship, didn't you?

256
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,950
You've caused a real mess.You'll
be punished for this, you know!

257
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,290
What father can sit idly by when
his daughter is about to get hurt?!

258
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,470
Kobato-san had been rescued!The
plan was underway!

259
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,060
What about the other one?!You
completely ignored her!

260
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,660
Officers have to learn not to
view people too lightly!

261
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,120
You could learn a thing or
two from Commander Jonathan!

262
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,190
Lt. Commander! About that hostage!

263
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,230
All sections believe that
she's part of the Straw Hat crew!

264
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,030
What?!

265
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,780
Stop right there, Inspector.

266
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,470
Where are you going?

267
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,030
I don't believe I'm required to
report my actions.

268
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,990
We are.

269
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,470
I see. Then please tell the commander this.

270
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,330
"I had a lot of fun."

271
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,590
Screw you!

272
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,600
I guess there's no point
in disguising myself now.

273
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,120
Why're we going along
the edge of this cliff?!

274
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,350
We'd have cannons on both sides if
we went through the middle!

275
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,200
This way, we only have to
worry about one side!

276
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,780
Where am I?!

277
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,380
Oh, he's awake!

278
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,400
Huh? When did I get on Merry?

279
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,920
After a bunch of this and that.

280
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,280
I see! Nami as a hostage! Nice!

281
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,170
Isn't it, though?!

282
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,580
You are good at tricking people.

283
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,660
But why'd the ship start moving on its own?

284
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,840
Oh, I bet it was the old maintenance guy.

285
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,790
Why's that?

286
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,870
I just get that feeling.

287
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,460
Nami-san dressed as a nurse is really nice!

288
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,730
We managed to get out, but what do
we do without maps or charts?

289
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,610
This is why I wanted to look
around the place first, you morons!

290
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,190
Robin-chan!

291
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,640
So cool!

292
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,890
So Major Shepherd was a fake?

293
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,750
I'm sorry, sir. She got away.

294
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,110
You're not at fault.

295
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,330
I just have a bad habit of
being weak around pretty women.

296
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,030
Huh?

297
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,670
Anyway, that makes six. We're currently
searching for the last one!

298
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,040
Oh, there's no need for that
now. I just found her.

299
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,900
Sir?

300
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,590
I contacted the medical room.

301
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,060
They said they aren't missing any nurses.

302
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,770
A map of this fortress!

303
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,120
I thought we might need it to escape.

304
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,730
You know the score!

305
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,500
You're the only one who's on my side, Sis!

306
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,810
A-Am I?

307
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,230
They're shooting at us!

308
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,200
I thought we were okay
cause we had a hostage!

309
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,690
They were bound to realize
the truth eventually!

310
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,210
Warships are coming after us!

311
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,550
There is no hostage! Everyone
on board is a Straw Hat member!

312
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,260
I repeat, all cannons,commence
firing consecutively!

313
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,470
That's this fortress'
gateway: the "Sea Gate."

314
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,160
Usopp, prepare the bow cannon!

315
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Chopper! Don't get my orders wrong!

316
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,840
Got it!

317
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,130
If that's the only exit, our only choice
is to break through by force.

318
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,120
But I don't like that there are
more shallows than this chart shows.

319
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,290
That's unsuitable for a
port, so why is it here?

320
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,210
Something doesn't seem right...

321
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,180
It's all-clear on your end?That's
fine, then. Keep watch.

322
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,040
Reporting, sir. The pirate ship appears
to have reached the Sea Gate.

323
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,990
That makes it checkmate...

324
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,460
But it's a real shame. You
weren't careful enough, Straw Hat-kun.

325
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,010
Say what?! We don't have a single cannonball?!

326
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,550
Nope! We don't even have a
box to hold explosives!

327
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,930
That does seem only natural,given
that the navy confiscated the ship.

328
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,810
What're we gonna do?! We can't bust
through that gate like this!

329
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,120
Just means we gotta fight our way through.

330
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,830
All we gotta do is gain control of the
device that raises and lowers it.

331
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,160
Don't talk like it's easy!

332
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,980
Don't worry! I have a nice idea!

333
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,070
Target the enemy pirate ship!

334
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,070
Fire!

335
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,230
Gum-Gum Balloon!

336
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,040
Yes!

337
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,880
I see! I hadn't thought of that!

338
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,460
Nice, Luffy!

339
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,100
Now let's get--

340
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,370
We have no cannonballs or explosives?

341
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,480
Nami?!

342
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
Hey, what's wrong?!

343
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,530
Nami?

344
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,040
We've been had...

345
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,920
The treasure is gone!

346
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:25,540
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

347
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:33,640
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

348
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:46,190
All the answers are right here, pouring out

349
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:52,720
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

350
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,410
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

351
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,510
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

352
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:14,090
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

353
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,840
Where'd you disappear to, you damn pirates?!

354
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,920
Don't tell me you managed to
sneak past the cannoneers

355
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,090
and vanish beyond the horizon
in that short period?!

356
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,600
They won't try to escape.

357
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,560
There's no point without the gold!

358
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,390
Pirates leaving treasure behind is
shameful! Right rudder, full!

359
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,100
"The Pirate Ship Disappears!Fortress
Battle, Round #2"

361
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
