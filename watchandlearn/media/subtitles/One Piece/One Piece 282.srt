2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,030
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,820
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,390
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,580
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,130
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,450
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,700
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,470
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:24,590
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,220
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,020
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,820
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,980
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,880
We are!

24
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,000
Looks like they pulled through. Good timing.

25
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,280
To think that you were going to die alone...

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,750
That's heartbreaking, Robin-chan.

27
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,210
I don't want to see people
sacrificing themselves anymore!

28
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,010
I can't think of any reason
for you to be kind to me!

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,010
Why...? Why did you?!

30
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,140
"Parting Builds a Man's Character!
Sanji and Chopper"

31
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,440
What happened to your leg?

32
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,290
Without that leg, you won't
be able to be a pirate any more!

33
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,710
I guess...

34
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,000
Why...? I didn't ask for your help!

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,290
I can't think of any reason
for you to be kind to me!

36
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,970
Why...? Why did you?!

37
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,840
Because you...

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,270
You had the same dream as me.

39
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,740
The All Blue...

40
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,990
But... even your men said it doesn't exist...

41
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,030
Of course it does! When the
time comes, head to the Grand Line.

42
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,580
The All Blue surely exists there.

43
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,760
As you see, I can't be a pirate anymore,
but this time, you can go and find it.

44
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,380
H-Hey! Geezer, don't die!

45
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,630
Don't just do as you please
and die as you please!

46
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,360
That damn geezer gave up
his leg so that I could live.

47
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,990
Wha...?!

48
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,960
I...

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,410
I can't repay the damn geezer for his
kindness unless I risk my life for him too!

50
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,750
Dying isn't something you
should do to repay kindness!!

51
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,000
That's not what he saved you for!

52
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,960
Being given life and yet dying...
is something that a weakling would do!

53
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,690
Then is there any other way
to settle this matter?!

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,030
Chore boy!!

55
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,540
Chore boy...

56
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,630
Are you all right?!

57
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,160
Ha! I'm not quite done yet...

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,600
You made me angry.
I won't let you die so easily.

59
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,470
Dammit! That bastard Krieg brings
out weapons one after another...

60
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,070
There's no way that chore boy can...

61
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,150
Even if hundreds of weapons are built in,

62
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,030
he can be defeated by someone
with a spear of blind determination.

63
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,000
Life or death...

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,750
In a pirate battle, if you fear death
for even a moment, you'll fall to pieces.

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,140
What're you talking about?

66
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,690
At least...

67
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,120
...that kid doesn't have any hesitation!

68
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,040
Is it a survival instinct...?

69
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,340
Or does he not fear death
because he has faith in himself...?

70
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,670
Faith...

71
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,550
The fleet Krieg gathered...

72
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,850
His hundreds of weapons and poison...
If they're all force...

73
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,030
...then that kid's spear is also force...

74
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,610
The spear held in his heart...

75
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:22,210
I know an idiot who's holding back
that spear for a stupid reason...

76
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,310
What?!

77
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,610
This is gonna end it... for sure!

78
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,660
Gum-Gum...!

79
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,290
...Giant Gavel!!

80
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,420
--Wait!
--Hm?

81
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,000
We both have foolish dreams.

82
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
Hm?

83
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,810
In order to achieve my goal, the All Blue...

84
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,810
Sanji?

85
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,270
Yeah. I'll come along... on your journey
to become "King of the Pirates"!

86
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,360
What?

87
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,750
I'll be the cook for your ship.

88
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,580
Is that okay or not?

89
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,030
It's okay!! All right!!

90
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,910
I'm happy for you, Big Bro Luffy!

91
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,870
Yeah!

92
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,160
Yaay! Yaay! We got a cook!
We'll have good food!

93
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
So that's how it is, everyone.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,440
Sorry for causing you all sorts of trouble.

95
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:05,680
Ha! I don't like it! I wanted to
kick you out from here myself.

96
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,690
And you decide it so easily...?

97
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,660
Sorry for making you resort to bad acting.

98
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,730
You knew?!

99
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,480
I could hear everything, since you're all stupid.

100
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
What?!

101
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:25,250
That is to say, you're willing to go that far
to kick me out, huh, you damn geezer?!

102
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,660
Why do you always have to
talk like that?! You bastard!

103
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,040
Hmph! That's right, little brat!

104
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,830
I don't like kids to begin with.

105
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,730
Not a single day passed where I didn't regret
letting a useless one live, you damn brat.

106
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,050
Ha! Fine by me, you damn geezer!

107
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,730
Enjoy the rest of your life to the utmost.

108
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,060
Whoa! This is a nice ship.
Is it okay for us to use it?

109
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,250
Of course! It's Sanji's boat.

110
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,900
Let's go.

111
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,580
You don't have to say goodbye?

112
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,410
That's okay.

113
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,580
Sanji!

114
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,060
Don't catch cold.

115
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,980
Owner Zeff!!

116
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,140
Thank you for all the damn things
you've done for me over all these years!!

117
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,190
I'll never forget your kindness...
for the rest of my life!!

118
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,430
You asshole!!

119
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,670
I'll miss you, dammit!

120
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,350
I'll miss you!!

121
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,360
I'll miss you!!

122
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,400
I feel sad, dammit!

123
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,960
You idiots!

124
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,730
Men should part without a word.

125
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,770
Let's go!! Set sail!!

126
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,510
I'll see you again, you damn bastards!

127
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,500
As long as you don't fear even death
because you have faith in yourself...

128
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,270
...you'll find the All Blue... for sure...

129
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,380
Guys! Customers are gonna show up soon!

130
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,940
Get to work already!

131
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,910
Robin has been alone all this time...
just like I used to be.

132
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,010
You've been shot? We need to stop
the bleeding right away or you'll die!

133
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,590
You can! You can!

134
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,630
You can! You can be a great doctor...

135
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,470
Doct... I can't breath...

136
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,110
...because you have such a kind heart...

137
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,610
I wonder if Robin didn't
have anyone like Doctor...

138
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,570
Really, there are some strange
creatures in this world.

139
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,690
You must really have spent your
whole life disliked by everyone.

140
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,200
You poor monster. Why's a loner
like you trying to save this country?

141
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,450
Don't make me laugh!

142
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,180
Shut up! Even if I don't
have friends, I can still fight!

143
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
As long as Doctor's flag exists, I will...

144
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,520
You do have friends!

145
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,440
I am your friend!

146
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,020
Hey, let's be pirates together! Okay?!

147
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,150
It's not possible.

148
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,860
Yes, it is, since it's fun!

149
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,210
Hey, you don't make sense.

150
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
But...

151
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,440
But I'm a reindeer! I have antlers and hooves!

152
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,180
I even have a blue nose!

153
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,780
It's true... that I wanna be a pirate, but...

154
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,470
I'm not even a human! I'm a monster!

155
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,260
I can't become your friend! So...!

156
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,280
So I just came to say thank you...

157
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,360
I do appreciate you guys.

158
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you for asking me to join you.

159
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,330
I'll stay here, but...

160
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,930
...one day... if you feel like it, stop by agai...

161
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,850
Shut up! Let's go!

162
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,020
You don't ask people to join you
by telling them to "shut up."

163
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,070
That felt good! Hey, do it again!

164
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,950
You idiot! We're setting sail right away!

165
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,830
I-I thought I'd die...

166
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,040
Hm? Where am I?!

167
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,090
Ah, Sanji-san! You came to?

168
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,420
Doctor! It wasn't just a fantasy, right?!

169
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,620
Your research was completed then, right?!

170
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,760
Or was that a lie, too?

171
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,160
I did it, Chopper! My research succeeded!

172
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,270
Did you lie because I'd be sad
if you died without saying so?

173
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,980
"Nothing is impossible for the man
who raised a flag with a skull!"

174
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,130
Please say it again, Doctor!

175
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,080
Are you ready, young men?!

176
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,460
--Yes, Ma'am!
--Fire!

177
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,930
Listen, Kureha. This dust is...

178
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,170
Dr. Kureha! What in the world...?

179
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,520
Just shut up and watch.

180
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,550
Dr. Kureha! We shot all of them!

181
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,860
Light them up!

182
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,820
Amazing...

183
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,790
Yeah...

184
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,260
It's so beautiful...

185
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,870
I will make cherry blossoms bloom.

186
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,910
Once my invention is complete,
this country will be saved!

187
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,080
Listen. This red dust isn't ordinary dust.

188
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,050
This will attach to the white snow in the air

189
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,940
and make vivid pink snow fall.

190
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,970
Doctor...!

191
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,770
Doctorine...!

192
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,930
I will never shoot you!

193
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,160
My name is Dr. Hiriluk! I'm a doctor!

194
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,120
Tony Tony Chopper. That's a cool name,
isn't it? That's what I'll call you.

195
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,120
Chopper, you'll be able to become
a good doctor. I'll guarantee it.

196
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,010
Even if I disappear, my dream will come true.

197
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,550
I had... such a good life!

198
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,020
Thank you, Chopper!

199
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,400
Now, have a safe trip, my stupid son...

200
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,610
Robin...!

201
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,840
You're not alone anymore, got that?!

202
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,800
We'll rescue you for sure, so just wait!

203
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,860
The sound of the sea train?

204
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,530
Here we go!

205
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,370
I knew it!

206
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,510
"Straw Hat Theater"

207
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,830
"Part 4"

208
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,900
"Ruthless Time"

209
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,210
--I'm bored.
--Yeah.

210
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,130
"Moai"

211
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,440
"Moai"
"[Bored]"

212
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,400
Bring me some meat or I'm
gonna frickin' kill youse guys!

213
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:04,110
"Don Luffione, Luffione Family"

214
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,470
Why do I smoke cigars, you ask?

215
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,980
'Cuz the air in this frickin'
world stinks, that's why!

216
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,110
(Dandy)

217
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,860
I called youse guys here today for one reason...

218
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,940
I think it's time we made clear who's
boss of this town once and for all!

219
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,110
It's me, you dumbass!

220
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,080
No way, any idiot would realize it's me!

221
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,040
"Don Zorocia, Zorocia Family"

222
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,000
"Don Sanjino, Sanjino Family"

223
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,950
Sanjino, a bonehead like you who
doesn't even slick his hair back

224
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,660
isn't even qualified to be boss of this town.

225
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,510
I've got my reasons, okay?!
It's slicked back on one side, isn't it?!

226
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,270
One side?! Don't make me laugh! That's like
saying you've got half a pair of balls!

227
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,340
--What'd you say?!
--That's the last straw! This calls for all-out war!

228
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,420
Why the hell are you starting the war?!

229
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,650
Anyway, war it is.

230
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,600
Make him eat lead, Usotooya.

231
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,330
Imma gonna take out Zorocia.

232
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,100
Usotooya failed!

233
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,940
"Usotooya of the Luffione Family died in battle."

234
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,780
Go take out Luffione while he
don't have his men to protect him!

235
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,170
I'm gonna take out Luffione.

236
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,490
Chopalini failed!

237
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,660
"Chopalini of the Sanjino Family died in battle."

238
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,750
Know your enemy well, Namimore.

239
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,350
I'm gonna take out Sanjino.

240
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,390
Mamma mia!

241
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,010
The Sanjino Family has been taken out!

242
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:16,600
"Don Sanjino of the Sanjino Family
ascended to heaven."

243
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,800
Now, where's his safe?

244
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,060
Oh, wow! He sure was loaded!

245
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,720
Namimore failed!

246
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,520
"Namimore of the Zorocia Family
died from happiness."

247
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,730
Oh, well. She still killed Sanjino.

248
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,610
Robita, go take out Luffione.

249
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,030
--I'm not interested.
--What?!

250
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,360
Zorocia has been betrayed!

251
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,960
"Don Zorocia of the Zorocia Family
died thinking, 'I never thought
my ally would kill me.'"

252
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,280
No! They actually shot each other!

253
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,170
"Robita of the Zorocia Family died thinking,
'It wasn't supposed to be like this.'"

254
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,890
Robita failed!

255
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,750
Hell yeah, I'm the boss!

256
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,510
Now I can stuff myself with as
much meat as I want in this town!

257
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,670
What the hell...

258
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,940
To think that meat tastes
terrible when I eat it by myself...

259
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:07,550
I... I finally realized just now
what the most important thing is...

260
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,350
I feel lonely... I feel lonely...

261
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,370
If this is a dream, I wanna wake up.

262
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,780
--Oh, that was a dream.
--Who the hell are you?! And that was a dream?!

263
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,450
The more I wish to be with them,
the more I make them suffer.

264
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,670
I thought it was something I dared not wish for.

265
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,690
But, Saul...

266
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,930
...you were right.

267
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,190
I was able to meet friends who will protect me!

268
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

269
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,060
"Everything Is for Her Friends!
Robin in the Darkness!"

270
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
