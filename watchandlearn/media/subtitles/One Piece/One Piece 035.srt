2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,310
Nami would never kill Usopp!

25
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,980
We're friends!

26
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,690
Who're friends, Luffy?

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,380
Don't make me laugh.

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,160
You're just a pathetic bunch of
people cooperating with each other.

29
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,300
Now I see...

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,980
Yeah, that'd hit you hard.

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,930
To think that someone
really showed up for her...

32
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,090
Friends, huh?

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,720
The most painful word for her...

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,840
So that's how Nami pretended
to kill me and let me escape!

35
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,570
It looks to me like there's a reason
she's in a fishman pirate group!

36
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,400
Please, don't get any more
involved with this village.

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,990
Leave Nami alone.

38
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,780
I'll explain the circumstances.

39
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,720
I'll pass.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,530
H-Hey!

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,830
I don't care about her past.

42
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,420
Where are you going, Luffy?!

43
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,540
For a walk.

44
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,490
Who's he?

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,720
"Untold Past! Female Warrior Bellemere!"

46
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,600
What a shock!

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,850
I guess we really did see a
ship fall from the sky, huh?

48
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,610
It seems some unordinary humans
have stepped foot on this island.

49
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,060
Who could it be? And why?

50
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,440
Look! Who's that?!

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,330
He's not from this island!

52
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,790
Oh? So those are fishmen?

53
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,140
H-Hey! Wait! You!

54
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,440
Huh? You called?

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,270
W-Who are you?!

56
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,180
What are you doing on this island?!

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,160
What does it matter to you?

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,870
Y-Yeah. You have a point.

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,290
I'm Luffy. I'm taking a walk.

60
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,040
A walk?!

61
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,010
Have fun!

62
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,830
You! Where are you headed?

63
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,200
Heck if I know!

64
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,740
He seems like a funny guy!

65
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,060
Just who is he?

66
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,700
He walked right by us,
with no fear whatsoever.

67
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,180
He's a mysterious guy.

68
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,450
Bellemere?

69
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,260
And this person raised you and Nami?

70
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,830
Yeah, that's right.

71
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,100
How should I start to explain
about Bellemere-san?

72
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,560
I fell asleep?

73
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,500
Huh? Nojiko?

74
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,860
Where could she have gone?

75
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,780
Just a little more, Bellemere-san.

76
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,690
Just a little more,
and everything will return!

77
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,440
Cocoyashi Village,

78
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,490
the tangerine orchard,
and even my dream!

79
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,200
It took eight years...

80
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,810
All done...

81
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,850
All done!

82
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,180
Now I just need to check that book...

83
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,210
Oh! Nacchan!

84
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,040
What's wrong?

85
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,290
Nothing! Nothing at all!

86
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,100
Oh, my!

87
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,610
Damn it, Nami! Not again!

88
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,030
--Oh? Did it again, Nacchan?
--Let go!

89
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,990
--You just never learn!
--I'm not a cat!

90
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,960
You idiot!

91
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,530
How many times do I have to
tell you stealing is wrong?!

92
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,660
Bleh!

93
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,870
It's not my fault we're poor!

94
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,850
Cheapskate!

95
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,370
Bellemere!

96
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,000
Bellemere! Your no-good
cat's been at it again!

97
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,800
Whadya want? You're annoying!

98
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,800
Oh! Welcome home, Nami!

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,930
I'm back!

100
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,800
Look! This is the umpteenth time!

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
She's even famous in the village now!

102
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,190
So?

103
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,010
Surely even you've
shoplifted before, Gen-san?

104
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,150
This is why she acts this way!

105
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm just kidding!

106
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,130
Alright. You paid for her, right?

107
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,480
B-Bellemere...

108
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,160
Thanks so much.
I don't have money right now.

109
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
I'll pay you later...

110
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,700
...with my body.

111
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,420
D-Don't be s-saying
things like that!

112
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,470
Look at you blush!

113
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,810
Oh? And why are you laughing?

114
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,680
Try that again and
you'll get 100 spankings!

115
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,940
I'm sorry!

116
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,730
But I really wanted this book!

117
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,070
If you wanted it,
why didn't you just tell me?

118
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,490
Because you wouldn't
buy it for me anyway...

119
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,190
Of course I would!

120
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,260
We do have some
money stashed away.

121
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,110
But the villagers said the
climate's been so good lately

122
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,010
that you can get tons of
tangerines from any old field,

123
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,240
and our tangerines won't sell good
'cause they don't go up in value.

124
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
They can mind their own business!

125
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,170
You're so dumb, Nami!

126
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,550
I would've stolen it way better!

127
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,020
I said no stealing!

128
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,890
I was just joking!

129
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,480
That hurts!

130
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,110
But you know,
there's one thing for sure!

131
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,820
The maps you draw are
really amazing, Nami!

132
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,790
First you learned how to draw
sea charts, and now land maps!

133
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,870
This is a map of this island, isn't it?!

134
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,250
No one would ever think
such a little kid drew this!

135
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,220
I'm studying navigation too now!

136
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,020
Navigation, too?!

137
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,180
It is Nami's dream!

138
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,360
Yeah!

139
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm gonna use my navigation skills
to travel to all the world's oceans!

140
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,050
And then I'm gonna make a
world map of everything I see!

141
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,780
So your map of this island is your
first step toward your dream, then?

142
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,510
Yeah!

143
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,710
A map of the world, huh?

144
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,840
Nami! Someday, you will
make your dream come true!

145
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,410
I just know it!

146
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,500
Hey, Bellemere-san.

147
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,430
You haven't been eating meals lately...

148
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,560
I've been eating tangerines, though.

149
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm on a diet!

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,680
I don't need any meals, either...

151
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,940
What're you taking interest in guys for?

152
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,100
Kids need to eat right!

153
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,610
You keep lying!

154
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,400
You don't have any food because
we don't have any money!

155
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,520
For reals?!

156
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,490
--You're suffering, so that we can...
--Diet!

157
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,490
You shouldn't underestimate
the beautifying power of tangerines!

158
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:47,450
They're the reason I still have
such lustrous skin at the age of 30!

159
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,390
But your hands are yellow.

160
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,170
Just shut up and eat!

161
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,130
Here you are, Nami! All done!

162
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,680
A super custom-made
Bellemere brand!

163
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,720
Another hand-me-down from Nojiko?

164
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,900
Here we go!
It looks great on you, Nami!

165
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,430
This lion used to be a sunflower!

166
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,480
It can't be helped!

167
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,070
You're two years younger
than me, you know!

168
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,560
Age has nothing to do with it!
I want new clothes too!

169
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,680
Mine are old clothes too, you know!

170
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,150
You get my stuff 'cause
you're my baby sister! Blehh!

171
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,140
But I'm not your real sister!

172
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,510
We're not related by blood!

173
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,870
Nami!

174
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,090
Bellemere-san!

175
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,510
So what if you're not
related by blood?!

176
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,880
Never say anything
stupid like that again!

177
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,110
W-Whatever...

178
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,820
You're not our real mother, either!

179
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,700
You'd be better off
without us, wouldn't you?!

180
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,940
That way, you could eat,

181
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,370
buy all the clothes
you want, and be free!

182
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,630
I wish...

183
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,340
I wish someone richer
had adopted me instead!

184
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,190
I-Is that so?

185
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,420
Fine, then! Do whatever!

186
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,140
If you hate this house that much,
then go leave for somewhere else!

187
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,100
Stop it, you two!

188
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,420
I will leave!

189
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,780
Nami!

190
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,660
Nami!!

191
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,950
Bellemere-san...

192
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,490
The three of us are a family!

193
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,530
I'm sure Nami feels the same way!

194
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,770
She didn't mean what she said!

195
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,740
You're a strong person, Nojiko.

196
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,430
That was real immature of me.

197
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Could you go bring Nami back for me?

198
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,620
I'll have a super delicious
supper ready before you get back!

199
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,800
Okay!

200
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,610
Okay, Miss! I'll lower it to this much!

201
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,320
Eh? Lower it a little more!

202
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,610
Right over here!
Low prices! Low prices!

203
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,780
It wouldn't hurt to buy any of
these fresh fruits lined up here!

204
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,160
So, coming here from the outskirts
of the village is "running away"?

205
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,620
That's sure nice and convenient!

206
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,460
Here. Drink up before it gets cold!

207
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,060
Bellemere-san would be
happier if we were gone.

208
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,010
Why do you think that?

209
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,180
Having two children
costs lots of money...

210
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,710
And everyone in the village
hates her, because of me...

211
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,530
You're old enough to
consider others now, huh?

212
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,170
Don't worry.

213
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,080
She was a famous brat in this
village when she was your age, too.

214
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,780
Bellemere-san was?!

215
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,610
Even now, she's still quite
a brat in the villagers' eyes!

216
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,110
How shocked the village was
when that brat suddenly said

217
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,800
she was going to be a marine...

218
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,240
A marine?!

219
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,300
Bellemere-san was a marine?!

220
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,590
Yeah.

221
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,260
Pirates have to pay for
slaughtering innocent people...

222
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,050
With those words, she left the village.

223
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,240
She says she felt her time
to die had finally come...

224
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,620
Oh, well...

225
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,010
Your baby sister?

226
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,570
No. I don't know who she is.

227
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,500
You have no idea
how that makes me feel...

228
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,160
And that was you, Nami.

229
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,710
When she saw you, Bellemere
mustered up the will to live again.

230
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,930
It is a boat! I knew it!

231
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,710
On a stormy night like tonight?!
Who on earth could it be?!

232
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,590
Doctor! Call the doctor!

233
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,650
Bellemere? Is that you, Bellemere?!

234
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,830
Bellemere!

235
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,430
What is this?!

236
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,920
Who are these children?!

237
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,090
Doctor! They have terrible fevers!

238
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,240
They've been completely
worn out by the storm!

239
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,350
What?!

240
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,650
Alright! But we need to tend to
those nasty wounds of yours, too!

241
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,690
Just hurry!

242
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,660
Please! Don't let them die!
Save those kids' lives!

243
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,330
I beg of you!

244
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,130
What did you just say, girl ruffian?!

245
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,340
I'm going to be these kids' parent.
That's what I said.

246
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,640
You can't!

247
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,220
Don't do it!

248
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,810
A punk like you can't
possibly raise children!

249
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,850
T-Take my advice! Give them
to a government institution!

250
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,490
I've already decided!

251
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm an adult now, too.
I was even in the navy.

252
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,820
I think I'm a little
more upstanding now.

253
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,710
I'm going to take the responsibility
of raising these kids.

254
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm going to raise them
to be wonderful people

255
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,130
who won't lose to the era we live in!

256
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,650
I'm going to live with these kids.

257
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,770
Nami and Nojiko gave me life.

258
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,760
You girls have a bond that goes
far deeper than a real family's.

259
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,100
Nami! I thought you'd be here!

260
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,850
N-Nojiko!

261
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,300
Bellemere-san is waiting for us!

262
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,820
She's making a yummy supper!

263
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,770
Okay!

264
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,080
I bet it's your favorite!
Omelets with tangerine sauce!

265
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,400
Yes!

266
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,970
Yay! Omelets!

267
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,520
How time flies...

268
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,130
Children once on the brink
of death, now so full of life...

269
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,110
Watching them grow up
is like a joy for all of us!

270
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,610
Yeah!

271
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,680
We won't feel happy until we see
that family of three happy! Right?!

272
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,690
Yay! Yay!

273
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,490
Pirates, everyone!

274
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,150
Pirates are coming!

275
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,960
Pirates! Everyone hide!

276
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,780
It's the Arlong Pirates!

277
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,570
Arlong?!

278
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,460
That can't be!

279
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,830
What are fishmen from
the Grand Line doing here?!

280
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,430
Was the rumor about a split in
the fishman pirate group true?!

281
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,060
Nami! Nojiko!

282
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,170
Gen-san!

283
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,980
It's dangerous here!
Hide in the back woods!

284
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,430
Eh? But...

285
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,670
Go! Now!

286
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,650
You seem to be in excellent
spirits, pathetic humans!

287
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,260
As of this moment, this village--

288
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,120
no, this island is now
under my control!

289
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,400
Listen up!

290
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,380
On this memorable day,
you will all buy your lives from me!

291
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,040
100,000 Berries per adult.
50,000 Berries per kid.

292
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,230
Those who can't pay... die!

293
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,380
What do we do, Nojiko?

294
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,370
We can't pay that much!

295
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,860
But they might not spot our house!

296
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,930
You can't see it from the village!

297
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,910
How much did we get, brother?

298
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,880
Just over 25 million, I'd say.

299
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,590
Excellent!

300
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,420
Sounds like we'll hafta pay
for our lives every month

301
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,050
at 100,000 Berries
per person from now on!

302
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,870
100,000?! We can't
make a living that way!

303
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,120
Endure it for now!

304
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,510
We should just be glad no
one in the village has died.

305
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,000
If money is all that's needed,
it's an easy price to pay.

306
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,690
I at least hope they'll leave
without noticing Bellemere's house.

307
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,000
With the two children, it would
come to 200,000 Berries...

308
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,670
I doubt she has that much saved up.

309
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,060
Alright! Time to go, brothers!

310
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,710
Arlong-san! There's smoke
coming from outside the village!

311
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,050
Okay!

312
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,690
Alright, let's see!

313
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,910
Too delicious!

314
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,150
Nothing's quite like Bellemere's
Special Tangerine Sauce!

315
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,640
Nami and Nojiko are gonna
leap out of their seats!

316
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,020
The smoke is coming from a house!

317
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,940
Oh? We almost missed it.

318
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,400
Damn!

319
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,000
Bellemere-san!

320
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,240
Let's go! Let's collect our money!

321
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,490
Whoa, this is bad! The pirates...

322
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,290
...are headed to Bellemere's house!

323
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,700
Hey! Nojiko and Nami are gone!

324
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,760
What?!

325
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,440
Ten more minutes for the duck in
the oven. And the stew is boiling.

326
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,510
This'll be a big blow
to our family budget.

327
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,430
But I guess I'll splurge, anyway!

328
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,900
Bellemere-san's gonna...
Bellemere-san's gonna...

329
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,540
Bellemere-san's gonna be killed!

330
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,830
My overflowing feelings don't connect

331
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,670
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

332
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,590
I'll set off by myself,

333
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,550
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

334
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,270
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

335
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,370
Why is it so hot?

336
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:55,370
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

337
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,670
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

338
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,510
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

339
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:11,260
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

340
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,610
With you, I can run there

341
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,420
Oh! How cute Nami-san
was as a child!

342
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,530
Geez, were you even
listening to the story?!

343
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,590
Of course I was!

344
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,770
I'd listen to every single word
that's about Nami-san! Got that?!

345
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,090
Yes, I'm sorry.
Wait, why am I apologizing?!

346
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,540
Is it over? Where's Luffy?

347
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,950
He was really sleeping?!

348
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

349
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,260
"Survive! Mother Bellemere
and Nami's Bond!"

350
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,410
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
