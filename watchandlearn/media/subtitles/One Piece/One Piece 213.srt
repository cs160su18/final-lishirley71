2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,050
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,710
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,220
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,610
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,440
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,670
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,300
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,150
Armée de l'Air Power Shoot!

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,440
Go!

25
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,040
Goal!

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,560
Goal! Goal!

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,670
Team Straw Hat is victorious!

28
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,510
Shelly!

29
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,930
Wh-What's this?!

30
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,770
Captain Monkey D. Luffy has
chosen Shelly, Tonjit's former horse!

31
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,320
What in the world is he thinking?!

32
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,950
Old stilts guy. I took Shelly
back from those guys.

33
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,050
You guys...

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,660
Now you can always be together.

35
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,790
I truly appreciate this. Thank you.

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
Well, that explains that.

37
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,380
Guess it couldn't be helped this time!

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,590
That's a good girl!

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,220
Chopper!

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,680
Got a problem with that?

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,930
Nope!

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,560
Chopper...

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,440
Leave it to me! It'll be just fine!

44
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,510
Yeah, sure. Uh-huh.

45
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,250
I wonder what the next game will be.

46
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,280
Let's get started!

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,620
We will win Chopper back!

48
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:54,630
"Round 3!
The Round-and-Round Roller Race!"

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,010
Don't worry, Shelly. I'm sure it'll be all right.

50
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,970
Let's have faith in them.

51
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,930
"Delectable oden"

52
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,010
Two daikon sticks and two
mochi tofu pouches, please.

53
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,430
You got it!

54
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,360
--Bring Support Pillar #6!
--Hurry it up!

55
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,030
Hey, where'd you put my wood plane?!

56
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,780
This next game sounds fun.

57
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,120
"Foxy Life!"

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Fun? How can you say that, Robin?

59
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,290
Put yourself in Chopper's shoes. Poor guy...

60
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,120
That's a good point. I apologize.

61
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,960
It's no big deal...

62
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,920
...compared to these carefree dimwits!

63
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,390
Oh, ladies!

64
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,520
--You're both so lovely!
--Oh! Are you ready?

65
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,100
What are you eating, Luffy?

66
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,450
A Long Kiwi!

67
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,810
That old hooorse guy gave
it to me! It's pretty good!

68
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,030
--You can't have it.
--I don't want it!

69
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,770
Mellorine!

70
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,200
It's time for Round #3,
the "Run Roller Round" roller skating race!

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,960
It's a head-to-head race on an outdoor track!

72
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,820
Once again, the rules are simple!

73
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,590
First, each team's scorer will start
skating at the sound of the first whistle,

74
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,050
and team defenders will follow suit after
the second whistle 20 seconds later.

75
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,510
Defenders can hinder the opposing
team or root for their own!

76
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,850
Anything goes!

77
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:34,750
After five minutes are up, the team
whose scorer is in the lead wins!

78
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,110
Naturally, being even a single step
ahead means victory in that round!

79
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,150
Incidentally, yours truly will
be doing the play-by-play

80
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,080
from a special seat by the starting line!

81
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,280
All right! It's time for
both teams to come on out!

82
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,020
Okay, guys. We have to
get Chopper back this time.

83
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,580
Let's do it!

84
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,860
Yeah!

85
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh! The Straw Hat Dangers
come out with a war cry!

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,560
And lying in wait are the
indomitable Foxy Devils!

87
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,900
First is the team's playmaker, Porche-chan!

88
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,360
Next is the speedy Chiqicheetah

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
and Masshikaku, the defense's linchpin!

90
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,830
Then there's the fishmen Jube and Girarin!

91
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,530
Oh, and last but not least!

92
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,330
Our own Foxy is the head coach,
with Hamburg as manager!

93
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,200
A truly powerful lineup, indeed!

94
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,510
H-Huh?!

95
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,850
Oh, my! Chiqicheetah is clashing
even before the starting whistle?!

96
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,390
What's with this guy?! He's creepin' me out...

97
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,690
He's indeed a quick runner,
but he's also sensitive to smells!

98
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,610
You ate something pungent, didn't you?!

99
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,740
Ha! You didn't eat that old guy's
rotten hunk of milk, did ya?

100
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,330
Oh, is that why?

101
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,330
You did eat it?!

102
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,330
M-Man, you're rude!

103
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,460
Shoo! Shoo!

104
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,240
Looks like nothing happened...

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,140
Allow me to continue explaining the rules!

106
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,930
Each team has a coach and a manager!

107
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,270
Neither is allowed to directly
participate in the game!

108
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,360
Be aware that a person
can only be a scorer once!

109
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,410
Oh, but there are only four
Straw Hats who can serve as scorers!

110
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,990
They're one man short!

111
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,780
What will come of this?!

112
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,920
All right! I'll let one of you
participate twice, since I'm a nice guy!

113
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,670
Pride permitting, of course!

114
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,460
I can't stand his tone!

115
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,230
You're so generous, Boss!

116
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,300
Your kindness seriously moves me to tears!

117
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,220
You're a real man!

118
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,720
Oh, you guys!

119
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,180
You're too much!

120
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,120
He's actually taking that
lame flattery seriously!

121
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,190
Man, Split-Head sure is dumb.

122
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,060
It's like watching a lame play.

123
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,980
Oh, Boss! Come back!

124
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,820
But maybe we should take him
up on his offer! You know?

125
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,160
Well, as much as I hate to
admit it, it is our only option...

126
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,080
It's for Chopper's sake. This is
no time to get hung up on pride.

127
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,840
Thanks!

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,770
A match is a match, though! We won't lose!

129
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,170
You're too soft-hearted.

130
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,090
Wanna know why I would make
an offer that benefits you?

131
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,810
It's because...

132
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,140
...we're the best--!

133
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,850
All right! Let's win Chopper back!

134
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,350
Yeah!

135
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,980
Boss!

136
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,150
Both captains have agreed
to the rule amendment!

137
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,190
Straw Hat Dangers, please
select a scorer for each round!

138
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,160
With five rounds, the odd-numbered
rounds of 1, 3, and 5 are key.

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,500
Especially the very first round...

140
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,750
Put me in two rounds! Okay?! Okay?!

141
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,840
Okay! Just shut up! I'm trying to think!

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay, so I'll stick Luffy in
Round #1 and Round #5...

143
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,930
All right!

144
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,680
But I can't ask too much
out of Nami-san and Usopp...

145
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,890
Robin-chan.

146
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,640
I hate to ask, but could
you switch to Round #3?

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,340
Sure. Any round is fine with me.

148
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,320
Thanks-- Oh, wait.

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,150
Could the other team have the same idea?

150
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,480
In which case...

151
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,160
Come on! Hurry up!

152
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,120
Okay! All set!

153
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,620
Luffy has Rounds #1 and #5. Nami-san has #2.

154
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,500
Usopp has #3, and Robin-chan has Round #4!

155
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,910
Hold on! Why do you get to decide that?!

156
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,630
Huh? 'Cause I'm the coach
and you're the manager, duh.

157
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,680
Screw that! Why do I have
to take orders from you?!

158
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,300
Isn't it obvious?!

159
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,430
You can't be coach with all that
moss seeping into your brain!

160
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,010
Your eyebrow's funnier than you are.
Looks like coiled poop.

161
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,180
Poop?!

162
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,570
There's one more very important
thing to keep in mind!

163
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,690
Knock it off! I can't hear him!

164
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,490
Be aware that going in reverse
or leaving the course

165
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,200
will result in immediate disqualification!

166
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,450
Starting before the whistle
means disqualification, too!

167
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,330
All right, everything appears
to be set! The first round pits...

168
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,380
Oh! It's a clash between two big shots!
Straw Hat Luffy versus Porche-chan!

169
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,340
This looks to be a heated
battle from the very start!

170
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,040
Now let's get underway!

171
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
Talk about exciting!

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,680
--I love these races!
--Me too!

173
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,690
Porche-chan! Beat that rubber dude senseless!

174
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,900
Check it out!

175
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,940
Wha...?! Wh-What in the world?!

176
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,980
You can't be serious...!

177
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,030
Th-This is hard...

178
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,210
A-Am I seeing things?!

179
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,440
I don't see it! I don't see anything at all!

180
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,140
Oh, my! He can't skate at all!

181
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,350
And according to the roster, Straw Hat
Luffy plans to skate in two rounds!

182
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,600
Is this game already over?!

183
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Are you serious?! This'll be a cinch!

184
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,480
Upsy-daisy...

185
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,570
Now what do we do?

186
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,120
Wait... Does this mean the third round's
gonna be extra important now?!

187
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,990
Both teams are finally at the starting line,
but will this even be much of a race?!

188
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,860
It's time to begin!

189
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,490
I can't believe you asked to be in two rounds!

190
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,390
It's not my fault! I didn't think it was this hard!

191
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,650
It's over! It's all over!

192
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,500
We have no choice, though.
We'll have to pick up the slack.

193
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,280
Okay, it's time! Scorers, get in position!

194
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,210
Hey! Not you again!

195
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,300
You'll have hell to pay if you
try any funny stuff again!

196
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,190
There's no need for "funny stuff";
it's already clear we're going to win!

197
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,730
It's time for the third game:
the Run Roller Round!

198
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,690
Will Straw Hat Luffy emerge
from Round #1 victorious?!

199
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,530
Or will it be our own Porche-chan?!

200
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,450
On your marks! Get set!

201
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,010
There she goes! Porche-chan
starts off with a spectacular dash!

202
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,800
Meanwhile, Straw Hat Luffy is...

203
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,340
...flat on his face!

204
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,760
He's collapsed before even
crossing the starting line!

205
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,880
That was an impressive fall...

206
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,260
Stupid things!

207
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Whoa, now! Removing your skates
will mean instant disqualification!

208
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,140
Darn it!

209
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,590
Oh! I can just grab those--!

210
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,070
Ooh! This is too easy!

211
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,450
Twenty seconds have passed!
It's time to let the defenders loose!

212
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,410
Masshikaku!

213
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,870
Hey! He's about to get pinned! Help him!

214
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,750
Are you crazy?!

215
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,590
Wha...?

216
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,470
Gum-Gum Balloon!

217
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,110
That's it! Now, Usopp!

218
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,220
Huh?

219
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,010
H-Hey!

220
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,520
Listen! We're gonna keep
knocking you forward!

221
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,810
Don't you dare exhale, Luffy!

222
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,900
Talk about low!

223
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,110
Cien Fleurs! Delphinium!

224
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,530
Robin!

225
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,740
--It's her again!
--Awesome!

226
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,250
What speed!

227
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,880
He's well on his way to
catching up with Porche-chan!

228
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Oh, no!

229
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,420
Flower Shurikens!

230
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,970
Oh, no!

231
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,270
Amazing! I've never witnessed
a race like this before!

232
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,690
But the Foxy Devils have some serious defense!

233
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,360
I'm a wall...

234
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,360
Oh! But he clears the wall with a skillful toss!

235
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,450
Is it only a matter of time
until he catches Porche-chan?!

236
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,950
Nice, Robin-chan!

237
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,410
Nope!

238
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,750
Killer Sword Festival!

239
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,800
What a turn of events!

240
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,520
Straw Hat Luffy has gone outside the course!

241
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,730
--No way!
--He cut him!

242
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,190
You okay, Luffy?!

243
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,250
Rest easy! My Killer Swords don't cut!

244
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,690
They're all show!

245
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,700
I-I don't feel so good...

246
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,570
What kind of bragging is that?

247
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,290
This is bad...

248
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,620
Luffy's in the fifth round, so me,
Usopp, and Robin all have to win...

249
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,750
Chopper might not be
the only one at risk now...!

250
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,100
The winner of the first round is Porche-chan!

251
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,970
One point to the Foxy Devils!

252
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,220
Darn it!

253
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,680
Just get down from there!

254
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,640
All right! Let's move right along!

255
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,900
The second round match-up
pits the heartless Navigator Nami

256
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,650
against the King of Defense,
the Human Wall: Masshikaku!

257
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,280
I just have to give it everything I've got!

258
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,660
Round #2!

259
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,330
On your marks! Get set!

260
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,070
And they're off!

261
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,560
Oh, but what a shock!

262
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,410
Masshikaku is slow!

263
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,090
Like, really slow!

264
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:17,050
The heartless Nami quickly increases her lead!

265
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,680
What's with this guy? Is he even trying to win?

266
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,730
What is this?! What's going on?!

267
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,190
Is this some sort of tactic?!

268
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,060
Forget about him, Nami! Just keep movin'!

269
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,020
Right!

270
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,440
There's the second whistle!

271
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,530
Let's do it, Robin!

272
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,530
Wh-What are they doing?!

273
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,630
Just try and get through, if you dare.

274
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,580
Not even water can get past us!

275
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,420
Little late to be playin' roadblocks!
We're the ones in the lead...

276
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,710
Wh-What's with you guys?! Move!

277
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,090
Wait! Don't push yourself, Luffy!

278
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,640
We're gonna win if things stay as they are!

279
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,220
Yes, maybe!

280
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,470
Flower Hypnosis!

281
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,180
What...?

282
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,300
We were asleep?!

283
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,260
So it would seem...

284
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,550
Luffy! Get up! Hey!

285
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,310
But things still look the same... right?

286
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,140
Yes...

287
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,360
Nami! Hurry!

288
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,820
Hurry up!

289
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,240
--You need to get moving!
--Five!

290
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,990
--Huh? Why?
--Four! Three!

291
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,240
Two!

292
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,280
One!

293
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,710
Team Foxy wins two rounds in a row!

294
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Victory is already within reach!

295
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,920
That can't be...!

296
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,170
They did a full lap while we were asleep...?

297
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,880
Yep! Sucks to be you!

298
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,390
I can't believe we beat 'em with Masshikaku!

299
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,940
Is this for real...?!

300
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,920
Team Foxy scores twice in a row!
Luffy's team is in a real pinch!

301
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,460
The third round is now a crucial one!

302
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,800
It pits long-nosed Usopp against
Chiqicheetah the speedster!

303
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,080
M-My chronic sickness--

304
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,620
Don't give us any crap about
a "Can't Race Anyone" disease!

305
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,700
Eep...

306
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,010
Are you kidding me? Chiqicheetah is a cheetah!

307
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,840
--I don't stand a chance...
--Oww.

308
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,760
No. Relax more and use your hips.

309
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,640
You've skated before?

310
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,300
--No, but just watch how the others do it!
--Can't expect much help...

311
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,520
--Stand with your legs spread out more!
--What I need is a strategy...

312
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,690
Like this? Oww...

313
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,740
--No!
--Like this?

314
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,290
--Oww!
--No!

315
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,290
Like this?

316
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,610
--Ouch!
--No! Listen to me, dammit!

317
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,950
On your marks!

318
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,710
--Get set!
--Nothing comes to mind...!

319
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,460
All right, whatever! I'll just go
as fast as I possibly can!

320
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,630
Oh! I'm in the lead?!

321
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,680
So fast!

322
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,470
No one's a match for Chiqicheetah's speed!

323
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,800
He doesn't need any support, ya know!

324
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,810
Damn! It's hopeless after all?!

325
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,650
No way! A full lap already?!

326
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,150
Maybe you two should sit back and relax too?

327
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,980
It's not over until it's over!

328
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,950
Twenty seconds are up! Defense, go!

329
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,150
--Let's go, Robin!
--Yes!

330
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,410
My! How admirable!

331
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,140
He's already back?!

332
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,920
Take this!

333
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,090
--Oh...
--Oh?!

334
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,180
That's it.

335
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,560
Now do it just like I explained!

336
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,400
Oh! Is he gonna make it?!

337
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,480
Just a little more! You can do it!

338
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,950
That's it! Stand up, Luffy!

339
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,000
--Oh!
--I'm so moved!

340
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,830
Totally!

341
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,290
Luffy!

342
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,290
All right! I'm up! Hang on, Usopp!

343
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,050
Hang on, Chopper!

344
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

345
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,710
Chasing after something constant

346
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,340
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

347
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,590
Even when we're exhausted

348
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,760
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

349
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,180
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

350
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,100
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

351
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,900
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

352
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,860
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

353
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,940
Eternally... Eternally...

354
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
Wild fantasies from our childhood

355
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,570
We trace unforgettable memories

356
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,250
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

357
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,040
To this familiar sunny sky

358
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Together we entrust our feelings

359
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,460
We go beyond the changing time

360
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,260
Eternally... Eternally...

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,050
Straw Hat Luffy has finally found his footing!

362
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,050
All right! I'm not gonna lose now!

363
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,340
But standing is all you can do!

364
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,970
Can't this idiot who's inferior to me
in every way do something?!

365
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,060
Don't be sneakin' insults in!

366
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,310
Wait! I know just how to turn the tables on 'em!

367
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,850
Look forward to seeing me in action!

368
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

369
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,980
"A Seriously Heated Race!
Into the Final Round!"

370
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
