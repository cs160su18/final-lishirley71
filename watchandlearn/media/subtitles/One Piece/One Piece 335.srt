2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,710
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,170
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,010
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,400
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,610
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,150
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,900
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,490
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,510
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,260
Hot-Hot powers, to the max!

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,190
Maximum Heat Level: 10,000 Degrees!

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,310
You can still heat up?

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,910
"We'll Be Waiting in the New World!
Parting with the Courageous Pirates"

51
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,080
I'm hot! Hot! Hot!!

52
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,880
What on earth...?

53
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,130
Wh-What's going on?!

54
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,150
Wh-Wha--?!

55
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,440
Straw Hat!

56
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,240
Unforgivable! I'll melt
the likes of you in a flash!

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,280
Sultry Hot Night!

58
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,790
What?!

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,590
Yow, hot! Hot, hot, hot!

60
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,930
Gum-Gum Pistol!

61
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,520
Rocket!

62
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,020
What?!

63
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,770
Second Gear!

64
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,440
Gum-Gum...

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,200
...Jet Pistol!

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,530
Nose Jet!

67
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,460
Hot-Hot Head!

68
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,800
Ow, hot...

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,310
Huh?

70
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,270
Straw Hat!

71
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,270
Die!

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,110
Naked Balloon!

73
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,450
Steam Iron!

74
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,820
10,000-Degree Press!

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,830
Gum-Gum...

76
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,160
...Jet Gatling!

77
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,090
Jet Whip!

78
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,940
Ow, ow, ow!

79
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,780
What gives?

80
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,080
Lava! I had a feeling this island was...
Oh, yeah! That guy--

81
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,160
No way! That's impossible!

82
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,800
The water feels nice...
Actually, I wish it were warmer.

83
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,480
Doctor...

84
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,860
Tch! Hey, Robin. Think you could
work something out with your powers?

85
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,530
I can't tell which flag is ours.

86
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,780
Damn it! We're screwed!

87
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,910
We've hit the end of the line.

88
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,040
Huh? Up there... What's that?

89
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,540
Wh-What is it? What's up?

90
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,540
A bird...?

91
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,270
Wh-What is this?!

92
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,230
I-Isn't this...?!

93
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,650
This is it!

94
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,950
It's our Jolly Roger!

95
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,200
Thank goodness!

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,870
I was so worried--sheesh!

97
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,950
Isn't this great, Doctor?

98
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,580
Jiro!

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,540
Yeah, I'm so happy!

100
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,460
Yay! Hurray!

101
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,840
Hip-hip-hurray! Hurray!

102
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,730
Thank you.

103
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,150
Uh-huh!

104
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,280
Robin-chan, let's go!

105
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,240
We don't need to stick around
now that we've got our Jolly Roger!

106
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,660
--Right!
--All righty! To the Sunny!

107
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,910
Yeah!

108
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,830
Men, don't back down!

109
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,790
Put your backs into it!

110
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,800
It's hard to believe you were
licking those bounty hunters' boots!

111
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,430
Which is the real Commander Stansen?!

112
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,260
Beats me!

113
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,140
But this is the commander we all know.

114
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,430
Dammit, you guys! Quit your yakking and pull!

115
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,480
The captain and Jiro are risking their
lives to get our Jolly Roger back!

116
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,650
Protect our ship as if your lives depended on it!

117
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,320
Don't you dare let go!

118
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,530
Be proud of who you are!

119
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,910
We're the Phoenix Pirates!

120
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,990
Yeah!

121
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,350
--Sweet!
--Yay!

122
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,350
Take that!

123
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,810
We did it!

124
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,140
Okay, men! Let's take the ship back.

125
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,850
Roger!

126
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,360
Why those--! It's horrible! The penguins
are headed for Straw Hat's ship!

127
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,320
Those little...!

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,790
What now? They're coming back!

129
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,510
Yo, penguins! Long time no see.

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,260
This time, you get to face me.

131
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,360
It's hot!

132
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,070
There is nowhere left for you to run.

133
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,530
Soon that block of ice will sink into the lava.

134
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,200
Hah! I just have to kick your
butt before that happens.

135
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,330
Sounds simple enough!

136
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,170
Everything you say burns me up!

137
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,880
Hot-Hot...

138
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,670
Luffy...!

139
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,050
...Net Surfing!

140
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,840
Wh-What?!

141
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,260
Luffy!

142
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,890
C-C-Crap!

143
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,270
I won't let you escape!

144
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,360
Hot Omelet Shot!

145
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,820
I'm melting!

146
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,240
Uh... Huh?

147
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,490
I'm not melting?

148
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,830
What's going on?

149
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,330
Luffy!

150
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,750
Nami!

151
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,120
Looks like my Cool Ball made it in time.

152
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,250
But it won't last for long!

153
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,590
Luffy, finish this fight fast!

154
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,550
Yep. Thanks for your help, Nami!

155
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,970
You don't know when to give up...

156
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,720
Of course not! I'm gonna kick
your butt and go to the New World.

157
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,190
All of you pirates are nothing
but a bunch of idiots!

158
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,570
You go on about the "New World"
and that "King of the Pirates" nonsense.

159
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,070
You dream about things that'll never happen!

160
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,030
As a result, our business is flourishing!

161
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,330
I tell you, it's easy for bounty
hunters to earn a fortune--

162
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,910
it's the ultimate business!

163
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,840
And it's all thanks to idiots who're
willing to throw their lives away

164
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,840
for a meaningless scrap of
cloth called a "Jolly Roger."

165
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,270
Shut up!

166
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,060
What was that? You say something?

167
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,900
Don't... say another word.

168
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,320
Prepare yourself, Naked Balloon!

169
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,570
"Prepare yourself," huh?

170
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,410
You're better than most at
putting up the tough-guy act.

171
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,540
But look at your surroundings!

172
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,960
You might as well be in the burning pit of Hell!

173
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,340
For me, this feels like a cool breeze.

174
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:06,010
But for you, it must feel like you're
being cooked alive in a boiling pot!

175
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,640
It's no big deal.

176
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,180
What?

177
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,810
You aren't the least bit hot!

178
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,690
There is no way someone frozen over
like you could compete with my fire!

179
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,400
What?

180
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,150
Have you lost it? You think
you're hotter than me?

181
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:34,080
Open your eyes! Who could surpass the
heat emitted by my boiling hot body?

182
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,660
--Hey!
--Huh?

183
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,960
Quit arguing with me--bring it on!

184
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,170
I'm gonna send you flying!

185
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,590
What did you say?! That's bull!

186
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,470
I'm the 10,000-Degree Man!

187
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,760
What of it?!

188
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,560
My blood is boiling... at a million degrees!

189
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,980
What?

190
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,900
Gum-Gum...!

191
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,730
Bring it on! Take me down...

192
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,610
...if you can!

193
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,870
...Million-Degree Bazooka!

194
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,040
Watch out! Your hands are going to melt.

195
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,040
Not hot! It's not hot!

196
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,500
It's not hot! It's not hot!

197
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
What?! That's impossible!

198
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,890
Go flying!

199
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,990
Flag... Our flag...

200
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,680
What's this?

201
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,390
Whoa! What the heck?!

202
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,650
What's goin' on?

203
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,900
Ah! Over there!

204
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,610
--Luffy?!
--What's he doing down there?

205
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,740
Hey! Luffy! We got the Jolly Roger--

206
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,910
No!

207
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,120
Huh? Oh, it's the guys...

208
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,580
Hey, guys! What're you doing over there?

209
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,210
Crap! He found us!

210
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,670
Wh-What now?

211
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,920
Guys!

212
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,130
The ship! Hurry back to the ship!

213
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,720
Got it!

214
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,260
Hurry!

215
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,260
Huh? Those guys...

216
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,640
Hey, wait! What about the flag?

217
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,560
Hey!

218
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,690
Everyone, remember!
Pretend this never happened.

219
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,230
--Hey, wait up!
--Gah, he's coming!

220
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,530
Hey! I said to wait up!

221
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,990
What about the flag?! The flag!

222
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,530
Can't hear him! Can't hear him!
Can't hear him! Can't hear him!

223
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,200
Hey, guys! Hurry!

224
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,950
Wait!

225
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,830
Crap! He's coming!

226
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,370
What should we do?

227
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,620
Sanji-kun! Zoro!

228
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,290
Roger! Let's do it.

229
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,090
Huh?

230
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,380
Fly!

231
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,670
That hurt!

232
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,340
--Here I go, Usopp.
--What?!

233
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,390
You'd better land on the ship.

234
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,470
Wait just a darn second!

235
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,180
Pound Phoenix!

236
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,020
You sent me flying!

237
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,480
--Franky!
--You can count on me!

238
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,810
Coup de Boo!

239
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,770
It smells like cola!

240
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,030
What are you guys doing?!

241
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,660
Didn't they steal the Jolly Roger?
We've gotta hurry and get it back!

242
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,080
Huh? The Jolly Roger?
What are you talking about?

243
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,290
You musta been having a nightmare? Right?

244
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,000
Huh? Y-Yeah!

245
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,420
Luffy, look over there.

246
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,250
What?

247
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,720
Huh? We've still got both of them.

248
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,100
Did that clone technique guy lie to me?

249
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,230
Guys, sorry I ever doubted you.

250
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,100
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it.

251
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,780
Phew, that was a close one.

252
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,070
W-We make it in time?

253
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,490
We did it!

254
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,950
You were great, Jiro!

255
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,790
You're a man among men!

256
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,950
Jiro!

257
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,210
I'm impressed that you managed
to get the Jolly Roger back.

258
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,670
I am very proud of you.

259
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,090
Thank you.

260
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,510
Captain!

261
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,680
Captain...?

262
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,350
Jiro, I want you to hoist the Jolly Roger!

263
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,020
The Phoenix Pirates are setting sail!

264
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,900
Okay, Captain!

265
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,070
Let's get ready, guys!

266
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah!

267
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,200
Pull us out of here!

268
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,580
--You got it!
--Yeah!

269
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,660
Let's beat it!

270
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,060
Stansen, sure enough, your decision was right.

271
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,350
I put you through a lot
while the "captain was gone."

272
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,450
Are you watching, Vigaro?

273
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,500
I swear we won't let your death be in vain!

274
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,420
Men, let's hit the ocean!

275
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,960
Yeah!

276
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,550
Hey! What the heck's going on?

277
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,720
It's that Hot-Hot man's fault.

278
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,890
He stirred up the magma
in the underwater volcano.

279
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,690
Let's hurry! It's only a matter of
time before the volcano erupts.

280
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,900
Got it! Pull out to sea ASAP!

281
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,780
Yeah!

282
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,380
The island vanished...

283
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,720
Phew, that was a close call!

284
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,390
Lil...

285
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,520
Hey, you! I heard what happened!

286
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,690
You returned a piece of Papa-san's
collection to the Straw Hats!

287
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,360
What the heck were--

288
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,400
Shut up for a second!

289
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,030
Okay...

290
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,950
Lil...

291
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,910
Big Sister?

293
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,000
I've made you feel lonesome, haven't I?

294
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Let's apologize to Papa
about the flags together.

295
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,970
I'm sure he'll understand.
After all, we're family!

296
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,880
Arbell...!

297
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,970
Lil...

298
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,810
--La la-la la! La la-la la!
--Nice! That's nice, Arbell!

299
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,560
--La la-la la! La la-la la!...
--The way you care for your sister is really great!

300
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,160
St-Straw... Straw Hat...!

301
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,240
Papa, thanks for waiting! It's a bit late, but...

302
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,790
On a one, two...

303
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,620
Happy birthday, Papa!

304
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,750
Straw... Straw... Straw...

305
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,340
Straw Hat!!

306
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,470
Papa!

307
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,270
Where is Big Brother Campaccino
at a time like this?!

308
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,230
Straw Hat!

309
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,150
By the Accino Family name,
I swear I won't let you escape!

310
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,530
You're being a pest, Clone Technique Guy!

311
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,320
I will avenge Papa! Prepare yourself!

312
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,580
Campaccino!

313
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,710
What?! Puzzle?!

314
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,130
Your opponent is supposed to be me!

315
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,260
Straw Hat, he's my prey! Keep your hands off!

316
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,300
--Eh? What?
--You can go on ahead!

317
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,640
We'll deal with you in the New World.

318
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Wait for us to finish you off there!

319
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,560
Sure! Bring it on!

320
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,820
You... greenhorn!

321
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,070
Let's go!

322
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,110
Yeah!

323
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,410
Jiro!

324
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,580
Luffy, why aren't we going to help them?

325
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,410
They're going to get killed!

326
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,250
Chopper, take a closer look.

327
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,040
Does anyone there look like he needs rescuing?

328
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,840
Huh?

329
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,930
Guys...

330
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,900
Hey, you guys! Don't just sit and
watch us! Hurry and get going!

331
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,770
Doctor, let's meet up in the New World!

332
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,990
Yeah! That's a promise!

333
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,240
Okay! Sunny, full speed ahead!

334
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,450
Let's go! To the New World!

335
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,910
Yeah!

336
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,050
Hey, guys! How're you doing?!

337
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,260
I'm Chopper Man!

338
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,970
I don't really know if it's been a while or not,

339
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,640
but next week's One Piece is my special!

340
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,890
You'll definitely have a good dream!

341
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,560
Here we go! Killer Cute Spark!

342
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,640
On the next episode of One Piece!

343
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,440
"Go, Chopper Man!
Protect the TV Station on the Beach"

344
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm gonna be... a huge robot?!
