00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,370
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,190
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,520
--A dragon graveyard?
--No! It's not!

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,190
Grandpa Ryu said going back to
his nest would make him better!

23
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,730
This can't be a graveyard!

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,040
Apis...

25
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,220
Grandpa Ryu was a lost Millennial Dragon...

26
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,950
Luffy?

27
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,830
He was all alone, for a thousand years.

28
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,960
But he made friends with you, Apis.

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,390
He said out of the
1,000 years he was alive,

30
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,420
this last year with you was his happiest.

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
Luffy... You understand
the dragons' language?

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,500
I just somehow know.

33
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,620
Geez, talk about half-baked...

34
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,400
But there's no doubt about it!

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,540
You liar...

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,310
You're such a liar, Grandpa Ryu!

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,500
If this is the dragons' nest...

38
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,260
If you've made it back to the dragons' nest,
then open your eyes again!

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,740
Talk to me!

40
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,080
Get better!

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,300
Grandpa Ryu wasn't lying at all!

42
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,910
He said that Millennial Dragons
return to the nest every 1,000 years

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,900
and are reborn again.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,060
Grandpa Ryu said that?

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,970
There!

46
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,140
A baby Millennial Dragon?!

47
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,200
Out of my way!

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,340
"An Angry Showdown!
Cross the Red Line!"

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,010
Man, you're stubborn!

50
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,970
Yeah. I very nearly drowned to death.

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,170
Just look at this beautiful radiance!

52
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,940
Isn't it marvelous?!

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,880
This is all Dragonite,
the legendary elixir of immortality!

54
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,190
But breaking these
fossilized Millennial Dragons

55
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,830
won't produce anything usable!

56
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,070
Yes, so I hear.

57
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,650
But there is more than enough
live Dragonite here!

58
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,590
What do you say? A pointless
fight would only be tiring.

59
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,680
How about we make a deal
to split this treasure?

60
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,510
No.

61
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,980
--Do you not want eternal life?!
--Not interested.

62
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,500
You lie! There's no one
who's not afraid of dying!

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,600
Both of us may have Devil Fruit powers,

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,480
but a pirate's life is always
only inches from death!

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,490
There's no way you can't be afraid of dying!

66
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,620
I dunno. He's the kind of guy who'd
die smiling doing what he does.

67
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,790
Oh...

68
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,440
Fine, then!

69
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,380
You can sit there and watch
as I take my Dragonite and leave!

70
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,670
No!

71
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,510
Stop right there, girl!

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,510
Apis!

73
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,120
U-Usopp!

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
D-Don't be reckless, Apis!

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,430
Even if it's reckless,
I have to protect them!

76
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,150
This is a very important place
for the Millennial Dragons!

77
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm going to protect this
place forever and ever!

78
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,740
So you insist on defying me, huh?

79
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,890
In that case, you can all die!

80
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,090
Sickle-Sickle...

81
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,370
...Whirlwind!

82
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,960
Luffy!

83
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,350
I'll deal with him.

84
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,810
--But, Luffy!
--I promised him!

85
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,020
You're fine staying here?!
What kind of wimpiness is that?!

86
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,600
You still haven't accomplished your goal!

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
What happened to going to your nest?!

88
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,900
Don't give up by saying
you're staying here!

89
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,990
Of course I will! Don't worry about Apis!

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,200
I don't think so!

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,530
Sickle-Sickle...

92
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,960
Gum-Gum...

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,890
--...Whirlwind!
--...Pistol!

94
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,050
You can't hit me, rubber man!

95
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,650
Well? Are my wind slashes
sharp enough for you?

96
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,310
Run or hide wherever you want,
there's no escape!

97
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,980
Now, how will you dodge this?

98
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,850
This guy's pretty tough...

99
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,950
Is Luffy in trouble?!

100
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,720
Luffy...

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,370
Sickle-Sickle...

102
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,830
...Wind Slash!

103
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,880
Rapid Fire!

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,170
I'm not gonna run or hide!

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,380
Fool! Go ahead and get chopped up!

106
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,990
Gum-Gum...

107
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,860
W-What?!

108
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,030
...Bell!

109
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,040
And...

110
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,500
...Bazooka!

111
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,380
I win!

112
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,440
You did it!

113
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,220
--What is this?!
--Creatures like this really exist?!

114
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,520
I-It wasn't just a legend?!

115
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,820
Do you suppose this place'll
sink again after a little while?

116
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,790
When it does, will the Millennial
Dragons leave the island, too?

117
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,110
And I guess that baby Millennial
Dragon will fly off somewhere too?

118
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,270
What do you say, everyone?

119
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,960
Won't you have some of my
special pork buns before you go?

120
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,550
Oh! Thank you! But that's okay!

121
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,760
We gotta get back to our
journey right away! Right?!

122
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,720
We do? I wanna eat some pork--

123
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,020
Oww!

124
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,480
We'll just take the recipe.

125
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
I see. That's too bad.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,440
It'd only take three days
to prepare them, too.

127
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,710
I could tell you about the royal
family of Lost Island in the mean--

128
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,380
We've already heard about it!

129
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,950
Alright! Set sail for the Grand Line!

130
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,290
Apis. Want to come with us?

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,050
I've made friends with you all,
and I would like to go with you...

132
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,880
...but I'm going to stay on this island.

133
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,470
I'm gonna learn all sorts of
customs from Grandpa Bokuden

134
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,930
and protect the dragons' nest just
like my ancestors did before me!

135
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm going to wait for the baby dragons
to come back here someday!

136
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,400
But those baby dragons won't
be back for another... uhh...

137
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,950
A-Another thousand years!

138
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,870
Hey, now! Don't be so cynical!

139
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,900
No, it's okay!

140
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,290
I won't get to see the
dragons all grown up,

141
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,740
but I'm sure my kids' kids will get to!

142
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,090
So I'm going to keep protecting
this dragon nest forever and ever!

143
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,180
That's crazy talk!

144
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,890
You guys kept doing
crazy stuff too, you know!

145
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,360
We did?

146
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,050
See ya, Apis!

147
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,360
Apis! Never forget about Usopp-sama,
the brave warrior of the sea!

148
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,110
Bye-bye!

149
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,610
Bye-bye! Take care, everyone!

150
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,040
--See ya, Apis!
--Bye! So long!

151
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,370
Bye-bye!

152
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,970
Is Apis really gonna be
okay all by herself?

153
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm sure Apis will keep the nest safe!

154
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,840
She may be little,

155
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,440
but she's got twice the energy
and motivation of a normal person!

156
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,880
She'll be fine!

157
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
You're right, Nami-san.

158
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,190
She'll be okay!

159
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,110
Yeah!

160
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,150
Because she's our friend!

161
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,930
She sure is.

162
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,330
Are you sure you didn't
want to go with them, Apis?

163
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,790
I'd only get in the way if I went with them.

164
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,170
Besides, now I have
something I want to do!

165
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,410
I'm pretty reckless too,
but until I met Luffy and the others,

166
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,860
I don't think I would've felt like
I could protect this island.

167
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,600
I thought Lost Island was just
a story and that it didn't exist,

168
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,060
but Luffy and the others took
Grandpa Ryu on a search for it

169
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,260
without even doubting its
existence in the slightest!

170
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,070
I get the feeling that they taught me

171
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,250
that if you never give up on
your dreams and try your hardest,

172
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,540
your wishes just may come true!

173
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,630
Everyone worked so hard and
risked their lives for their friends,

174
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,920
who all had a heart-to-heart connection!

175
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,840
And I'm one of their friends, too!

176
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,990
So I'm going to try my hardest, too!

177
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,770
He's asleep!

178
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,430
Say? Will you help me with my dream?

179
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,110
Thanks! Let's try our best!

180
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,280
Oh, right! If you're going
to protect Lost Island,

181
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,200
you'll need to know about your ancestors!

182
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,200
First, there was the first king...

183
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,500
I-I've already had enough of that!

184
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,370
Hold on, Apis! Get back here!

185
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,510
Stop!

186
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,520
You need to know about these things!

187
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,580
--No!
--Apis!

188
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,450
Nami-san! I have a report of love!

189
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,410
I see big rain clouds up ahead!

190
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,620
There's a storm under 'em!

191
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,400
Looks like we're back
on our original course...

192
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,420
We should be seeing the
Red Line at any time now...

193
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,390
The Grand Line, at last!

194
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,640
Hey, Sanji! We're finally going!
We're finally going!

195
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,240
That hurts!

196
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,230
Sowwy!

197
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,980
Zoro!

198
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,120
But is it really like how it's drawn here?

199
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,940
Stop that!

200
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,700
Look at this!

201
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,670
I'd heard the rumors about it,
and it's drawn on this map, too!

202
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,630
If it really is true, then the entrance
to the Grand Line is a mountain!

203
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,190
A mountain?

204
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,810
--We gotta crash into a mountain?
--You can't be serious.

205
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,570
I didn't believe it myself,

206
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,740
but the map has canals
that lead to the mountain.

207
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,960
That might mean we have to go up it!

208
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,720
Neat!

209
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,280
What're you talking about?!

210
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,640
Even if there are canals or whatever,
a ship can't climb up a mountain!

211
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,280
But that's what the map says!

212
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,650
Yeah! Nami-san would never
say anything that's wrong!

213
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,360
You stole that map from Buggy, right?
Can we really trust it?

214
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,770
H-Hey! Someone help with the rudder!

215
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,040
--Sanji-kun! Give Usopp a hand!
--It won't budge!

216
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,410
--I can't think with all his shouting!
--It won't move! Someone help!

217
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,920
Yes, Nami-san!

218
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,130
Okay!

219
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,920
D-Doesn't this current
seem a bit strong?!

220
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,300
Eh?! Usopp! What did you just say?

221
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,050
"D-Doesn't this current
seem a bit strong?!"

222
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,840
Current...

223
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,800
--That's it!
--That's what?

224
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,630
They really do go up the mountain!

225
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,230
Are you still saying that stuff?!

226
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,890
Look here!

227
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,460
See? The guiding light was
definitely pointing to here

228
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,610
on the Red Line... Reverse Mountain!

229
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,070
Hey! Little help over here!

230
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,750
See these canals here?

231
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,150
If major currents from the four oceans
all flow toward this mountain...

232
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,820
Then the four currents would go up
these canals, collide at the top,

233
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,800
and then flow into the Grand Line!

234
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,590
Reverse Mountain is a "winter island,"

235
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,370
So any currents that
collide into the Red Line

236
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,540
will plummet from the
surface into the depths.

237
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,510
If we screw up and miss
the entrance to the canal...

238
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,010
...the Going Merry will run smack
into the Red Line's rock face...

239
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,780
...and get wrecked!

240
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,820
And then we'd be at the bottom
of the ocean. Understand?

241
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,150
Oh! Interesting!

242
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,150
So, basically, it's a mystery mountain!

243
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,520
Well, maybe you don't get it...

244
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,270
Anyways, now that we're on this current,

245
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,010
As long as we don't
mess up with the rudder,

246
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,120
we should be able to go straight
to the summit of Reverse Mountain!

247
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,030
Nami-san! You're so amazing!

248
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,920
I've never heard of ships
going over mountains before.

249
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,670
I've heard some stuff before!

250
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,420
Stories about the mystery mountain?

251
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,500
No.

252
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,320
I heard that half of everyone
who heads to the Grand Line

253
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,130
dies before entering it...

254
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,820
I knew getting in wouldn't be easy.

255
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,030
--Sanji-kun! Could you get the sail?
--Yes, Nami-san!

256
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,070
--Luffy! Help out!
--Eh?!

257
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,050
Hey! I see the mystery mountain!

258
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,460
W-What?!

259
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,510
T-That's insanely huge!

260
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,930
The entrance to the Grand Line...

261
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,350
So that's the Red Line, huh?!

262
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,780
I-I-I can't see the top
because of the clouds!

263
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,090
We're getting sucked in!

264
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,880
--Hold the rudder good!
--We're on it!

265
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,790
N-Nami! Where's the entrance?!

266
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,730
We're gonna crash into the rocks
if we keep going this way!

267
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,950
The crack in that cliff...

268
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,670
Nami! What do we do?!

269
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,420
--Keep going straight ahead!
--A-Are you serious?!

270
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,550
Just do it!

271
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,410
Nami! Is that the canal entrance?

272
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,750
Most likely!

273
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,330
This can't be for real!

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,430
The damn ocean really is
flowing up the mountain!

275
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,800
We gotta make our way through
those water gates just right!

276
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,720
Otherwise the ship'll
be busted into pieces!

277
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,730
W-We're getting off course!
More to the right! Right! Right!

278
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,110
The right?! Go starboard!

279
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,300
C-Come on, now!

280
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,740
The rudder!

281
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,630
Gum-Gum...

282
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,190
...Balloon!

283
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,020
Luffy!

284
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,430
Grab on!

285
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,920
We made it!

286
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,450
Now it's just a straight shot to the summit!

287
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,980
Hey! I wanna see! I wanna see!

288
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,130
I'm unstuck!

289
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,060
Hey! Let me see, too!

290
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,100
A-Awesome!

291
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,170
Curse you all!

292
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,650
--Huh?
--It's the Sicko Fruit guy...

293
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,960
--You!
--You're still alive?!

294
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,440
--What tiny eyes!
--Shut up!

295
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,470
Curse the whole lot of you!

296
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,380
Thanks to you, my dream of
Dragonite has been crushed!

297
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,840
I can't just leave things as they are now!

298
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,530
At the very least, I'll have
your 30 million-Berry head!

299
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,870
Just surrender to your fate
like a good little boy!

300
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,900
Now what?!

301
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,920
If he uses his wind slashes here,
there's no telling what he'll rip apart!

302
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,430
We can't act carelessly...

303
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,780
How do you like that?!
You can't lay a finger on me now!

304
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,350
Oh! Dragonite!

305
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,250
Bye-bye!

306
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,950
Oh! Good thinking!

307
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,920
He can't swim either, so I don't
think he'll be following us any more!

308
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,480
Given this current, being able
to swim wouldn't matter anyways!

309
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,880
Way to go, Nami-san!

310
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,820
We're in the clouds!

311
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,040
Awesome!

312
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,610
We're above the clouds now!

313
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,040
Look! The summit! It's the summit!

314
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,010
Yahoo!

315
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,810
To do what Mihawk said...

316
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,910
To find the All Blue there...

317
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,790
To draw my perfect sea charts...

318
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,470
To prove I'm a brave warrior of the sea...

319
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,850
I see it!

320
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,860
This is the greatest sea
in the world! The Grand Line!

321
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,660
The One Piece is up ahead, somewhere!

322
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,250
Go!

323
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,870
My overflowing feelings don't connect

324
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,710
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

325
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,630
I'll set off by myself,

326
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,340
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

327
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:40,350
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

328
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,440
Why is it so hot?

329
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:55,780
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

330
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,750
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

331
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,540
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

332
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,260
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

333
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,950
With you, I can run there

334
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,570
Nami-san! I see a mountain up ahead!

335
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,800
Who cares?! Go!

336
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,570
That can't be! It should be
nothing but ocean up ahead!

337
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,950
Huh? A black wall?

338
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,450
Crap! We gotta do
something before we crash!

339
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,680
--No! This is...!
--A whale!

340
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,580
A whale?!

341
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,250
On the next episode of One Piece!

342
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,420
"The First Line of Defense?
The Giant Whale Laboon Appears"

343
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
