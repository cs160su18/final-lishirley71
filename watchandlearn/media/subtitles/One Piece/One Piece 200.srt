00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesometreasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be Kingof
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyonedreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seenthrough
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destinyis
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieveyour
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

17
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,850
See ya, fortress guy!

18
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,830
H-Hey! It's me!

19
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,450
Hey!!

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,150
Imprison him!

21
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,070
You should thank Robin.

22
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,650
I see... She thought that it'd
besafer for me to be with you...

23
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,060
It might've been better if
I didn't check into it...

24
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,890
To think that there's
only one escape route...

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,250
"Daring Luffy and Sanji!Their
Great Rescue Operation!"

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,110
Among the Straw Hat Piratesthat
we already captured,

27
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,250
there was a man wearing a uniformwho
pretended to be a Navy officer.

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,020
Listen up! You can report it later!

29
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,810
When you see suspicious
individuals,imprison them immediately!

30
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,560
Yes, sir!

31
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,780
Did you hear?! That long-nosed guywas
a crew member of the Straw Hats!

32
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,130
Yeah. But why did he takethe
trouble to come here?

33
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,080
Yeah. In the bay, there're lots ofships
that are better than this one.

34
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,360
They could've taken oneof
them and quickly escaped.

35
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,230
That's how stupid pirates are!

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,120
You're right!

37
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,550
Oh? Are you already donefor
the day, Mechao-san?

38
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,040
Don't slave-drive an elderly man.

39
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,630
He says he's "elderly"!

40
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,310
As if!

41
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,950
You damn idiot! At least try to be careful!

42
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,960
S-Sorry.

43
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,270
Geez... This is such a complicated fortress!

44
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,300
I wonder where Zoro and Usopp are...

45
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,060
Well, since they got caught,they
were probably sent to jail.

46
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,280
Okay! Then we'll go to the jail!

47
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,840
Do you know where the jail is?

48
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,170
You don't know, Sanji?

49
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,740
How would I know?!

50
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,850
Hmmm...

51
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,580
I think that belly button
islandis suspicious after all.

52
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,120
What makes you think that?

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,000
Dunno, I just do.

54
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,450
But in any case, that sounds about right.

55
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,350
It's surrounded by the sea.

56
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,680
On top of that, the only way
toescape is to cross that bridge.

57
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,880
It's a pain, but I guess we should go there.

58
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,600
Alrighty!

59
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,320
Dammit! Going the way wecame
is also gonna be a pain.

60
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,130
Yes, sir! This is District
4 in Block F. All clear!

61
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,900
Keep searching!

62
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,520
Yes, sir!

63
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,010
They're in contact with each
otherusing Mini Transponder Snails.

64
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,410
This isn't gonna be easy.

65
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey, Sanji.

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,500
Hm?!

67
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,450
This is kinda exciting, isn't it?

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,460
Get moving already, you damn monkey!

69
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,930
Ouch!

70
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,250
Where am...?

71
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,600
Freeze!

72
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,910
"Port Entry Records"

73
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:22,360
This is strange. There're times whenno
ships enter or leave. Why is that?

74
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm being watched...

75
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,620
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?!

76
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,700
Who do you think I am?!

77
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,810
You told us over and over on our way here.

78
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,810
You're Special InspectorMajor
Shepherd, right?

79
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,820
If you know that, get
meout of here right now!

80
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,510
I have business with Commander Jonathan!

81
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,510
Major Shepherd?

82
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,140
Oh, I see! This is the guyRobin
was pretending to be!

83
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,630
Enough of your nonsense! There's no way

84
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,440
So they've mistaken him
for one of us instead!

85
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,710
a Navy major from Headquarters wouldlet
his ID and his coat be stolen so easily!

86
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,640
If that's the case...

87
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,070
Stop it now. It's disgraceful!

88
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,610
Hm?!

89
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,570
A man should know when togive
up! Let's not struggle...

90
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,380
...my comrade, Condoriano...

91
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,990
C-Condoriano?! What's
that?!Who the hell are you?!

92
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,710
Hey, hey... Stop making bad jokes...

93
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,620
You expect us to believe you'veforgotten
my face or your own name?!

94
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,000
Hey! Don't come near me! I'm not your buddy!

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
I don't know him! I don't know this man!

96
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,530
Ow, ow... What happened to you?

97
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,730
Oh, no... Did the impact from the
fallcause you to lose your memory?!

98
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,140
How sad... It's too sad!

99
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey! Please! Would you let at least him out?!

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,480
He's not the same Condoriano that I knew!

101
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,850
That settles it.

102
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,290
Yeah. There isn't even apoint
in interrogating him.

103
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,670
Wh-What do you mean, "that settles it"?

104
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,390
Wait! What're you going to do with me?!

105
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,910
Wait! Don't you get thatI'm
telling you to wait?!

106
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,760
Condoriano!

107
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,540
Who's Condoriano?

108
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,010
Shut up already!

109
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,960
Nice move, Zoro!

110
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,430
It went well! You should thank me, Robin!

111
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,560
You look creepy, Usopp.

112
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,150
Commander...

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,620
...there still haven't been any reportsof
the other Straw Hats being seen.

114
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,750
What should we do, Commander?!

115
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,850
They're probably having
ahard time finding the jail.

116
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,600
I guess we'll lead the way.

117
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,380
Huh?

118
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,570
You go ahead of them and wait.

119
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,360
Be sure not to act hastily.

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,310
Yes, sir!

121
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,250
Well, why don't we ensure ourvictory
by making the first move?

122
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,790
Ow...

123
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,580
What're you doing, Sanji?

124
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,220
Shh!

125
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,710
Dammit! I guess we have toforce
our way through after all.

126
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,590
Hey, it's unguarded down there!

127
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,400
Let's go, Luffy! We'll head down there!

128
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Okay!

129
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,450
Hello!

130
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,210
Reporting, sir!

131
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,990
The one we captured earlier

132
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,520
turned out to be a Straw Hat
memberwhose name is Condoriano.

133
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,730
Condoriano?

134
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,160
Yes, sir!

135
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,660
He insists that he's Major Shepherd...

136
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,990
...but we think that it's clearly a lie.

137
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,470
Okay, thanks.

138
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,950
So there're two Shepherds, huh?

139
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,270
Well...

140
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, Zoro... Don't youthink
this is kinda strange?

141
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,670
Yeah. It gives me a bad feeling.

142
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,460
Hm? Oh?

143
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,910
You're... Mechao-san...

144
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,730
Wh... What're you doing
in a place like this?!

145
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,240
What am I...? I just hada
little matter to attend to.

146
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,120
Pull them back already!

147
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,920
Hmph! I see...

148
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,770
So, what's your business?

149
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,920
It's not with you! I need to talk
tothat long-nose held captive there.

150
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,790
Wha...?! Wait! I can't let
youtalk to a prisoner so freely!

151
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,200
It won't take long. Cut me some slack!

152
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,650
Hey!

153
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,110
Ah! You're the guy from...!

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,360
Don't tell me somethinghappened
to the Going Merry!

155
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,140
Don't worry. Your ship is okay... for now...

156
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,510
Good...

157
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,670
You're the one whorepaired
that ship, aren't you?

158
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,620
Hm? Oh, sort of...

159
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,650
The way you did it isn't acceptable.

160
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,970
Unless you use splices,even
if you nail the iron sheets,

161
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,550
it'll break in no time whenstrong
winds blow, you know.

162
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,510
Splices?

163
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,390
What? You don't even know what splices are?

164
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,610
Well, actually, I'm not a maintenanceman
or anything like that.

165
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,770
The one that did those repairs was...

166
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,200
Someone did them in just one night?

167
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah. That was when we werein
a place called a sky island

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,810
that was 10,000 meters up in the sky, though.

169
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,470
Hm? 10,000, you say?

170
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,880
Yeah, yeah... You probablydon't
believe it anyway, do you?

171
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,380
Come to think of it, that shipfell
from the sky, didn't it?

172
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,500
What? You believe me?!

173
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Since I saw it with my own
eyes,I have to believe it.

174
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,370
Considering the angle at which it fell,

175
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,290
it probably fell from
aconsiderable height, so...

176
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,320
You're right! We had a reallyhard
time on the sky island!

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,750
There was God and there wereangels...
It was really tough!

178
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,590
God and angels?

179
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,020
You talk as if you died once.

180
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,490
Far from just once, there weretons
of times that I thought I'd die.

181
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,370
There were, huh?

182
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,190
By the way, about what you told me earlier...

183
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,870
Was it foggy the night that this
someonewho repaired the ship appeared?

184
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,970
Yeah! Exactly! How did you know that?!

185
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,760
Oh, do you, by any chance,know who that was?!

186
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,570
That could be, you know...

187
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,830
Uh-huh...

188
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,650
Wh-What're you doing?!

189
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,210
That's it, old man.

190
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,970
We're quite busy with various things.

191
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
Escort him out.

192
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,770
Yes, sir!

193
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,220
Hey, hey!

194
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,720
W-Wait! Hey! Tell me who that was!!

195
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,690
That's right. I forgot to
tellyou something important!

196
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,370
Listen, long-nose! When you repair the ship,

197
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,080
pay attention to the areasthat
you usually don't.

198
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,300
Those areas are often theones
most in need of repair!

199
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,780
If you treasure your ship, don't forget that!

200
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,630
You got that?!

201
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,290
Yeah! I got it, old man! Thanks!

202
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,630
Someone just came out!

203
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,310
Yeah. But that place really is fishy.

204
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,010
All right! Then shall we go?!

205
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,000
Hold on! This is a little strange.

206
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,540
We arrived here after
wetook the deserted route.

207
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,620
It's as if they're telling us whereZoro
and Usopp are... Which means...

208
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,820
I get it! The fortress guy is a nice guy!

209
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,310
It's a trap. A trap!

210
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,710
They're probably trying to savetime
and send us straight into jail.

211
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,140
Who cares?

212
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,610
Either way, we can't rescue Zoroand
Usopp unless we go inside, right?

213
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,360
Idiot! Why would we want to gettrapped
by our enemy so easil--?! Hm?

214
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,410
It's true that it'd be better than
wastingtime wandering around aimlessly.

215
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,290
I'm also worried aboutNami-san
and Robin-chan.

216
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,060
Sanji, are you thinking it over?

217
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,170
No, I'm not!

218
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,160
You did, didn't you?!

219
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,450
I said I didn't!

220
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,520
There's nothing in here!

221
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,200
Never mind that, get moving already!

222
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,350
Alrighty!

223
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,860
Hey, Zoro! Usopp! Where're you guys?!

224
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,530
Oh? Did you hear Luffy's voice just now?

225
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,240
Hey!!

226
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,210
It's really Luffy! Hey,
Luffy! We're right here!

227
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,030
Sure you wanna do that?Those
guys can hear too, you know.

228
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,800
Luffy, don't come!No, I
changed my mind! Come get us!

229
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,550
Hey, what should I say?

230
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,880
Beats me. Tell them to comeif
they want to or something.

231
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,000
Come if you want to!

232
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,390
I heard a voice!

233
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,670
It's this way!

234
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,130
Umph!

235
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,460
Oh, no... They came...

236
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,880
Be careful, Luffy!

237
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,250
They're here!

238
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,430
Hold on! I'll get you... out...

239
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,670
What the...?!

240
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,410
Oh, I see! This is the
Sea Prism Stone's doing!

241
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,060
We've been waiting for you!

242
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,270
Surrender obediently, Straw Hat!

243
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,280
Ha! You are making light of us, aren't you?!

244
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,570
You think that's enough to stop us?!

245
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,150
Is this still not enough?

246
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,030
It's all the same to me, idiots.

247
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,550
Now, what should I do?

248
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,940
For starters...!

249
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,140
What's he doing?!

250
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,020
Ha! It's painful to watch!

251
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,180
Those bars can't be broken unlessyou
use a cannon or something.

252
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,650
Dammit! These bars sure are tough!

253
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,370
Cannon...? Oh, yeah!

254
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,030
Sanji! Hey, hey, hey...

255
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,450
Take what's inside my pocket!

256
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,280
Your pocket?!

257
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,270
I have an Impact Dial in there.Use
it to break these bars!

258
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,410
Impact Dial... Hey, it causespain
to the user, you know!

259
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,420
This is no time to worry about
that!Now, take it already!

260
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,260
What're they talking about now?

261
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,050
Give up gracefully!

262
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,680
Well, wait a sec, gorilla man.

263
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,940
I'll show you something remarkable,so
keep your mouth shut.

264
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,640
A seashell?

265
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,370
It won't be my fault if
youget hurt standing there.

266
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,430
Oh, yeah, that's right...

267
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,810
Here we go!

268
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,980
"This well-tempered snake"?

269
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,270
That total moron!

270
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,310
What's that? Are you trying totell
us that's your secret weapon?!

271
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,290
Shut up! Or I'll gut you!

272
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,750
Yipes, he's scary! A backlash!

273
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,190
Ah! Um, Sanji-kun, sorry!It's
actually in the other pocket.

274
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,500
Here. It's this side. This side... This...

275
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,130
Flavor... It stinks!

276
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,110
Th-This is...!

277
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,880
I-It stinks!

278
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,960
Who the hell stored a fart in my Flavor Dial?

279
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,960
I... I'm... sorry...

280
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,910
I guess I didn't have to ask.

281
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,790
Watch out! It's gonna explode! Get down!

282
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,410
An explosion in the jail!

283
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,580
It's an emergency! Hurry up!

284
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,170
Hey, are you okay?!

285
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,650
Escape... successful?

286
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,080
Looks like it.

287
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,970
Ouch!!

288
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,890
Help...

289
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,230
Geez! What a pain in the ass!

290
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,910
Now, there's no point
staying here any longer.

291
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,780
Let's get out of here already!

292
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,790
Thank you!

293
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,960
Let's go, Luffy!

294
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,650
Alrighty! Guys, get out of here!!

295
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,400
Ahh! Hey, hey! Wait a sec!

296
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,750
Don't let Zoro go first! It
won'tbe my fault if we get lost!

297
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,000
Usopp, you jerk!

298
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
Is everyone okay?!

299
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,220
Y-Yes, somehow...

300
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,600
Okay, then! Those whocan move, come with me!

301
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,140
We'll go after the Straw Hats!

302
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,610
Those fools! Our men shouldbe
in place outside by now!

303
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,410
We'll attack them from both sides andsend
them to the netherworld this time!

304
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,540
Oh?

305
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,750
See?! We're lost!

306
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,250
Where are we?!

307
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,980
How can you get lost?! That's impossible!

308
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,290
Shut up!

309
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,750
Commander! I'm sorry!I
failed to catch Straw Hat!

310
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,810
What about the other members?Are
Roronoa and the others with him?!

311
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,730
Yes. Uh, well...

312
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,750
Witnesses told me that they didn'tsee
Condoriano with the others.

313
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,050
I see... Lt. Commander,the
bridge is guarded, right?

314
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,990
Y-Yes, sir!

315
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,700
Good! Well, don't be so discouraged.

316
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,460
We'll still have manyopportunities
to catch them.

317
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,000
Looks like those kids made their move.

318
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

319
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

320
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

321
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

322
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

323
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

324
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

325
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,260
A trap?!

326
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,060
Which means something fun might happen!

327
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,530
Well, worrying about
annoying crap is annoying.

328
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,570
We'll see what kind of trap it is.

329
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,560
So you think you can escapefrom
Navarone? And from me?

330
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,310
We won't get caught! We're pirates!

331
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

332
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,780
"Enter the Hot-Blooded Special
Forces!Battle on the Bridge!"

333
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,860
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
