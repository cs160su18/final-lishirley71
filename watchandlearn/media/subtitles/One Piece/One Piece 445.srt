2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,730
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,740
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,860
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,080
Now with Jimbei and Crocodile,
they're battling on level 4!

53
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,560
There's no need to hesitate!

54
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm...

55
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,090
...on the Government side!

56
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,930
I'm on level 2.

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,180
I've just taken care of the
fools running wild here.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,060
I blocked all the exits on this floor!

59
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,900
I don't know why Blackbeard
is attacking us...

60
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,360
--...but I already did something about it.
--Nice!

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,150
It's not something that I wanted to do but
I have no option under the circumstances!

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,330
I decided to release Shiryu against my will!

63
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,290
You did?!

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,550
Shiryu, how do you like
being out of the cell?

65
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,220
Yeah, I really learned a lesson.

66
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,890
The eternal boredom makes you long for death.

67
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,050
But you're not gonna use me as a pawn

68
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,360
and then ask me to go back into
the cell, are you, Magellan?

69
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,400
You're a condemned prisoner!
And this is a deferred sentence!

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,330
This is your only chance!

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,970
Yeah, I bet.

72
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,530
I'll keep that in mind!

73
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,920
I have the right...

74
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,580
...to cut you down!

75
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,120
"The Dangerous Encounter! Blackbeard
and Shiryu of the Rain!"

76
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,680
They broke into the jailers'
room and took the keys!

77
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,370
Let's set more prisoners free and
let chaos free in the prison!

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,070
Then, we can divide our opponents forces and
we will have a higher chance of survival!

79
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,110
If you wanna run, come on and get out!

80
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,630
It's your chance to break out! Come with us!

81
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,000
Wow! Are you gonna release us?!

82
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,000
Go Blugoris!

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,240
Go wild!

84
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,970
Damn, the Blugoris!

85
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,970
Chief Guard Saldeath,
we'll leave them to you!

86
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,600
Blugoris! Get that queer
king with a gigantic face!

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,350
It's not a "gigantic face,"
it's Face Growth Synthesis!

88
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,610
Blugoris! Get him!

89
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,150
Hell...

90
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,440
...Wink!

91
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,500
Heehaw!

92
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,290
He finished off the Blugoris
with a single blow!

93
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,420
N-No way!

94
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,050
I don't get it! What was that?!

95
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,630
Straw boy! You can't stop running!

96
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,260
Leave them to us and...

97
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,010
...you better keep going
forward and up! Now, go!

98
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,810
I got it!

99
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,130
Thanks!

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,900
--It's the demon guards!
--There're three of them!

101
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,320
Finally! We got our backup!
Sadie-chan's are here!

102
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,800
They aren't gonna let you...

103
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,040
...go any further beyond this point!

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,170
Let's go, Luffy-kun! I'll assist you!

105
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm not good at fighting on the land though!

106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,670
Yeah? You're strong enough!

107
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,300
Alright, let's get them, demon guards!

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,040
Gum-Gum...

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,260
Wait a minute!

110
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,150
We'll save you two the trouble!

111
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,190
Like Ivan-san said, you need
to keep going, Straw-san!

112
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,400
We'll take care of the demon guards!

113
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,070
You guys?!

114
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,910
People call us...

115
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,450
...The New Kama's Six Forces!

116
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,960
Oh! Are they formidable?!

117
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,590
These babies have a lot of friends...

118
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,330
...who got killed in the fire
and brimstone of Impel Down!

119
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,890
They hold grudges against especially
the merciless demon guards and...

120
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,390
their commander and the chief guard!

121
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,730
Humph! Take care of them already!

122
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,230
Take this!

123
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,400
Even a demon guard is just a big
oaf without his eyesight! Get them!

124
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,900
It was an eye-crusher!

125
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,280
Attack them at once!

126
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,450
Don't underestimate... mmm... these kids!

127
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,830
Even if they can't see you, they
still can smell you and feel you!

128
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,590
That's how Impel Down's...
mmm... demon guards are!

129
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,170
How about this?!

130
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,020
You can't fight back this time!

131
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,190
Okay, everybody, pull!

132
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,240
How dinky they are!

133
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,830
--No! They're too strong!
--Guns and cannons won't do!

134
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,590
--Help me!
--It's impossible! Don't fight! Get back!

135
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,260
--We're all gonna die!
--They're way stronger than Blugoris! Run!

136
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,680
I can't resist! Those screams!

137
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,140
--Help me!
--Those demon guards are formidable!

138
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,310
Third Gear!

139
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,320
Fish-Man Karate!

140
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,200
Get them all, demon guards!

141
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,030
Gum-Gum...

142
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,410
...Giant...

143
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,160
5000 Brick...

144
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,700
Sables!

145
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,300
...Fist!

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,720
...Pistol!

147
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,000
--No, the poison is...
--Damn! Get back!

148
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,750
Dammit! We can't even get closer to it!

149
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,920
That turd, Magellan, he's no fool!

150
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,760
What should we do?!

151
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,050
As long as this block of poison
is here, we can't get to level 1.

152
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,640
No way! Nothing will counteract
Magellan's poison!

153
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,770
It's impossible to break out
of Impel Down as I thought!

154
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,150
Shut up! We can't give
up after coming this far!

155
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,580
That's exactly what Magellan wants!

156
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,200
Have you got any insights?

157
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,660
Oh! Um...

158
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,990
Mr. 3! When we're in trouble,
we can depend on your wax!

159
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,850
Use your power and...

160
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,000
W-Wait a minute!

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,920
It's not as easy as
fooling Transponder Snails or Manticores!

162
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,670
Oh wait! I see!

163
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,130
Candle Coating!

164
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,350
I can cover the poison up with
wax! What was I thinking?!

165
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,810
You're good, Buggy! It was a great idea!

166
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,110
I wasn't thinking about anything!

167
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,150
You came up with the great idea so quickly!

168
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,440
You're a tower of strength!

169
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,200
I almost fell in love with you!

170
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,160
Of course! I'm not just a flashy guy!

171
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,370
You need to think carefully sometimes!

172
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,170
Do you get it, you fools?!

173
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,430
Now we're safe from the poison but
it's still blocking our way out!

174
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,260
That's true. It's not time to celebrate yet.

175
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,930
Don't worry! We got Captain Buggy with us!

176
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,190
He definitely has our next move planned!

177
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,270
What?!

178
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,360
You're right! There's no doubt about it!

179
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,630
What?! What?!

180
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,820
I mean...

181
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,320
Tell us!

182
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,740
W-Well...

183
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,160
--I'd do anything!
--What's next?!

184
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,410
--D-Don't ask me what t'do...
--"Wax'd do?"

185
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,420
Wax would do!

186
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,090
Let's use my wax power again!

187
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,220
We're gonna do it like when
Straw Hat beat Minotaurus!

188
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,550
"It?"

189
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,510
Ready, Straw Hat?! Candle Lock!

190
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,260
Alright! Gum-Gum...

191
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,350
...Mallet Rifle!

192
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,060
That was when we were in level
3 - the Starvation Hell!

193
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,790
I wanted to go up but I had to go
down to level 5 because of Straw Hat!

194
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,620
After that, it was a pain to
get back to level 2 again!

195
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,000
Are you ready, Buggy? Candle Lock!

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,940
I-I gotta do what he did?!

197
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm not ready yet...

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,550
Damn! There's no option!

199
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,970
Chop-Chop...

200
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,510
Go, Captain Buggy!

201
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,640
Release Wax-Wax and Candle Lock!

202
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,770
...Flashy Mallet!

203
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,160
--That's Magellan's infamous poison!
--It's like a creature!

204
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,080
Hey, wait! Gimme back my hand!

205
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

206
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,710
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

207
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,960
Oh my butt!

208
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,470
It didn't go like it did with
Straw Hat. That's all we had!

209
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,680
Damn! Magellan the turd!

210
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,810
Maybe you're the warden of Impel Down
- the greatest prison in the world!

211
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,480
But you're just a turd with the runs!

212
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,820
You've got no friends other
than the toilet seat!

213
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,030
--Buggy-san lost it at last!
--Magellan-chan, how's your seat doing?

214
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,240
We're stuck. No wonder!

215
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,870
You fools! Why can't you see it?!

216
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,910
Captain Buggy's not giving
up yet! He's still fighting!

217
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,790
Here's your bowels forecast!

218
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,040
He tries to fight the venom
with his venomous tongue!

219
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,050
As they say "Poison quells poison!"

220
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,130
You're gonna have loose
bowels all night long!

221
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,850
--What a man!
--That's the indomitable pirate spirit!

222
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,600
--He's a natural born captain!
--I will follow him forever!

223
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,560
Alright, Captain Buggy! We'll fight with you!

224
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,030
Poop, poop, diarrhean Magellan!

225
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,460
Raise the drawbridge!
Don't let them cross it!

226
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,710
Hurry up!

227
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,840
THE UNDERWATER PRISON IMPEL
DOWN LEVEL 1 CRIMSON HELL

228
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,840
Only five of them! Stop the Blackbeards!

229
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,810
S-Shoot!

230
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,920
Shoot! He's a Warlord but we're
pretty sure that he betrayed us!

231
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,070
Blackbeard is not on our side!

232
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,250
Pirates can't be on our
side in the first place.

233
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,000
Jail Manager Shiryu! When
did they let you out?

234
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,050
There are five of them...

235
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,810
Who's that? Here comes trouble!

236
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,520
Is he Magellan?!

237
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,190
I'm Marshall D. Teech.
You're Blackbeard, right?

238
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,860
Yes, I am! Who the hell are you?!

239
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,230
I blocked the exits on level 2.

240
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,570
Buggy the Clown and the others are trapped.

241
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,470
And I know that Shiryu can
handle Blackbeard on level 1.

242
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,950
That leaves us Straw Hat
and the others on level 4.

243
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,220
They've got Crocodile and Jimbei with
them and have become quite a force!

244
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,510
In Impel Down, we won't tolerate a riot...

245
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,940
...let alone a break out!

246
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
I'll be there soon!

247
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,740
You must hold Straw Hat and others
back until I get there, Hannyabal!

248
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,860
Vice Warden, we have a problem!

249
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,200
What's wrong?

250
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,500
According to the report from level 4,

251
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,580
the demon guards got beaten
in the blink of an eye!

252
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,630
T-That can't be true! The
demon guards can't be beaten!

253
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,840
Don't panic, stupid! Tell
them that I'll be there soon!

254
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,390
I'm gonna hold them back at any
cost until the Warden gets there!

255
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,480
I'll definitely fulfill this
duty that the Warden left to me!

256
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,020
Warden!

257
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,820
Hey, hey, Warden! Yes, yes, Warden!

258
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,520
Hey, Warden! Our great Warden!
Go for it, go for it, Warden!

259
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,540
Hey, Warden! It for go, it for go, Warden!

260
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,000
Vice Warden! The crisis on
level 4! Can we go now?!

261
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,760
This is it! We can't fight
them without the demon guards!

262
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,050
Break away! There's nothing to fear anymore!

263
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,390
Damn! They're multiplying, too!

264
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,180
Dammit!

265
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,400
--That's Chief Guard Sadie!
--Who cares! Push her away!

266
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,900
Shut up! You better call me Sadie-chan!

267
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,070
Manifesto of Excitement--Red Viper Whip!

268
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,660
How dare you...

269
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,080
...beat my sweet...

270
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,320
...minions!

271
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,050
Damn you!

272
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,970
Wait!

273
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,890
I told you to keep moving!

274
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,580
Heehaw!

275
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,650
I'm gonna be your match!

276
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,780
Don't call me "you!" Mmm... I
told you to call me Sadie-chan!

277
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,280
Emporio Female Hormone!

278
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,950
Get out of our way! Eccentric girl!

279
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,730
Shut up! Now you became a woman, Ivankov?!

280
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,960
You're just a confused anarchist!

281
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,650
For now, I...

282
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,440
...really feel like a woman!

283
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,190
Level 1! What's going on?
Have you gotten Blackbeard?

284
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,610
Answer me! What's wrong? Answer me!

285
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,820
It seems like fortune favors us now!

286
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,660
There's no response from level
1! Maybe they got wiped out!

287
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,450
That's ridiculous! Vice
Warden told me that...

288
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,830
...Warden Magellan has released Jail Manager
Shiryu and let him fight Blackbeard!

289
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,260
Even if the enemy is one of
The Seven Warlords of the Sea,

290
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,840
it's not so easy to beat Jail Manager Shiryu!

291
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,090
Humph! Maybe it's interesting to hear
the scream... mmm... of the queer king!

292
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,850
Women's weapons are not just their beauty!

293
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,670
These...

294
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,900
...lithe and soft movements are weapons, too!

295
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:08,600
And maybe you don't understand it because
all you do is snap a whip but...

296
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,830
...women care for others tenderly!

297
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,410
May his spirit rest in peace!

298
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,500
Ivan-sama! Stop mourning! I'm not dead yet!

299
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,860
Oh no!

300
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,220
In addition to that, women are
sometimes far stronger than any man!

301
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,590
Shut up! Red Viper Whip!

302
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,430
I will get you!

303
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,160
I can just pluck your head away

304
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,090
but then I don't get a chance to
hear your whimper so I'll wait!

305
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,860
I'm gonna take time and make you
suffer so let me hear you scream!

306
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,850
Now!

307
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,280
How stubborn you are! Let me hear it!

308
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,040
Let me hear the queer king
- Ivankov's final scream!

309
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,800
All of my bones shattered...

310
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,010
I-Ivan-sama!

311
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,390
Oh! I can't resist this!

312
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,510
...Or not!

313
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,270
Then why did you say it?!

314
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,930
No way! How come?!

315
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,630
By injecting Emporio Female Hormone,

316
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,380
my body got very lithe and soft!

317
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,780
So it absorbs any kind of shock!

318
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,870
How dare you!

319
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,910
Hey! That was too hard!

320
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,580
Heehaw!

321
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,460
Who is it?! She talks like Ivan-chan!

322
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,530
Hurry up! We're close to
the staircase to level 3!

323
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm gonna open the door!

324
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,270
Alright, let's go!

325
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,830
Why's that?! The door's opening by itself!

326
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,640
Who cares? It's our luck!
Let's go up to level 3!

327
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,310
This is the great fort
of hell! No one may pass!

328
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,540
Who are you?!

329
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,380
Magellan arrives on level 4, and makes his way to Luffy and the others.

330
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,600
Having eliminated the forces,
Luffy and the others attempt to reach level 3,

331
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,720
but Hannyabal stands before them

332
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,520
and finally reveals his true power.

333
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,940
"No Price Too High! Serious Hannyabal!"

335
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
