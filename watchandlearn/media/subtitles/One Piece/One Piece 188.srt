00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,140
Another warrior has perished...

18
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,230
And then there was that
earthquake... Damn it!

19
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,170
You're the evil spirits!

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,370
We're going to deal with you right now!

21
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,640
T-This wasn't the agreement! Stop!

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,280
Stop!

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,220
Look out!

24
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,690
Seto! Move aside!

25
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,750
What's the meaning of this?!

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,430
The Shandoran warriors
I know and look up to...

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,630
...have much more pride than this!

28
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,510
Kid...

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,320
"Free from the Spell!
The Great Warrior Sheds Tears!!"

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,440
When this sun lowers in the
west and sinks once again...

31
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,870
...your men's lives will
be offered to the gods!

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,290
Damn it!

33
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,190
The earth certainly swallowed you skillfully!

34
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,420
Truly an act of god! The fact that
you're alive is what's hardest to believe!

35
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,830
The entire ground?!

36
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,120
Prepare for the ceremony!
Take every last sacrifice to the altar!

37
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,100
Hey, wait a little longer!

38
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,950
The commodore'll be back!
Just two more hours! No, one! Please!

39
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,230
Why do we have to be burned at the stake?!

40
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,690
The sun is setting. The ceremony
should be starting soon.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,960
How unsightly! Is this the wreck
of a man who defied the gods?

42
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,010
What are you so afraid of?

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,290
What?!

44
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,270
You tremble before intangible fears

45
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,750
and give up people's lives
for false consolation!

46
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,290
False consolation?!

47
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,670
Your sacrifices are nothing
but pointless deaths!

48
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,880
We have lived this way for centuries now!

49
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,800
That doesn't mean it's right!

50
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,970
Silence, outsider!

51
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,480
However great your gods may be,

52
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,660
people's lives are even more precious!

53
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,490
Take the sacrifices to the altar!

54
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,650
Burn them at the stake and
send them into the heavens!

55
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,200
Commodore!

56
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,460
We're gonna be set on fire!

57
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,870
You can send an innocent girl to her death...

58
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,550
...and have no qualms about it,
so I doubt you'd understand!

59
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,340
What you're doing is less than human!

60
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,660
No qualms, you say?!

61
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,010
The girl yesterday...

62
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,380
...was my daughter!

63
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,420
You would tell your own
daughter to end her life?!

64
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,700
It's you people who don't
understand how much power there is

65
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,180
in the words our priests hear from the gods!

66
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,260
Our village is commanded to obey!

67
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,960
We can't beg for our children's lives!

68
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,640
It's one size smaller... It must
be the Kashi God's child!

69
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,510
The gods' blood has come
to pass judgment on you!

70
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,070
Judgment, my ass!

71
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,250
Sixty years ago, my own land
lost hundreds of thousands of lives

72
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,920
to the Kinetsu plague that
is ravaging your village now!

73
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,870
But, in recent years, there've been
absolutely no deaths to this disease!

74
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,600
Do you know why?!

75
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,830
Because we discovered a cure for it!

76
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,720
What I'm holding in my right
hand is the bark of a Cona tree!

77
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,550
The Conine I can extract from it is the cure!

78
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,890
If I return with this,
I can save the village!

79
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,990
Do you know how many man-hours
have been spent around the world,

80
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,780
and how many victims there have been?!

81
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,170
And you people are trampling
all over this great advancement!

82
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:32,180
That's why I say your "ceremonies"
are insults to those people!

83
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,800
Will I die in judgment, or in an accident?!

84
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,010
Will your village die by
curse, or by disease?!

85
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,770
Are you that afraid of gods?!

86
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,370
I do know when a man is
speaking earnest words...

87
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,300
Answer me.

88
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,680
What did I just kill?!

89
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,730
A snake.

90
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,960
No!

91
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,670
I just broke our
commandments and killed a god!

92
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:22,430
But you call it a snake, and our
deadly curse a curable disease!

93
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,240
Will you really save my beloved village?!

94
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,910
Can you save it?!

95
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,640
I can!

96
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,570
A-A snake!

97
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,030
Is this...?

98
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,880
Hey, Calgara! Look at this!

99
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,920
What a shock! I didn't know
that snake had a grandchild...

100
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,520
"That snake"?

101
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,090
A snake, huh?

102
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,190
Those two make no sense...

103
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,250
They were trying to kill each
other until just recently...

104
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,500
Now, they're such good friends!

105
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,470
Calgara is never very friendly
with any of the villagers, either.

106
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,690
I've never seen him smile like that before...

107
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,190
Just follow me.

108
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,030
We climb down here.

109
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,260
Climb down?

110
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,760
This ringing...

111
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,030
Hey, Calgara! Where is this
beautiful ringing coming from?!

112
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,440
Follow me and you'll see.

113
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,590
They're here!

114
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,190
Lost for words?

115
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,070
This is Shandora, a city of gold.
We are its survivors!

116
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,290
A city of gold...

117
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,710
It's like I'm dreaming!

118
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,420
W-Whoa! It's gold everywhere!
It's a city of treasure!

119
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,680
Hey, guys! Stop!

120
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,820
It's fine.

121
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,760
Load your ship with all the treasure
you can, aside from the gold bell!

122
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,930
Seto! Show them where the treasure is!

123
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,770
Right!

124
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,280
Are you sure this is okay?

125
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,090
The villagers already agreed to it.

126
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,240
We owe you for saving our tribe
from that terrible disease.

127
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,340
This is nothing at all.

128
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,900
You're so generous, Great Warrior!

129
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,490
But haven't your people been
protecting the city all this time?

130
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:04,590
Yes. We've protected the city...
but not necessarily its treasure!

131
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,040
To be more specific...

132
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,900
...only this stone.

133
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,300
What is this? Writing?

134
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,430
Writings of history.
It's known as a "Poneglyph."

135
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
We can't read it, either.

136
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,410
You mean your ancestors didn't write this?

137
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,010
All we know for certain is
that this city of Shandora

138
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,580
fought and fell trying to protect this stone.

139
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,150
We must continue to protect it
with that amount of resolve.

140
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,040
As descendants, it is our
duty to protect the proof

141
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,510
that our ancestors fought and survived.

142
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,830
We revere our ancestors as if they were gods.

143
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,050
Still, I had no idea it was this
giant, gold bell I had heard...

144
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,070
This bell's ringing has words to it.

145
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,180
Words?

146
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,530
So that the spirits of our ancestors
who were greeted by the heavens

147
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,260
can return to this land at
any time without getting lost,

148
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:32,770
we continue to ring this bell,
as a way to say, "We are here!"

149
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,770
Its sound proclaims the
unquestionable glory Shandora once had,

150
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,500
and makes its existence
known to the ends of the sea!

151
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,890
We will never run or hide!

152
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,540
That's why we call this city's
grand bell the "fire of Shandora."

153
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,820
That explains why it has
such a majestic sound!

154
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,190
Do you think so?!

155
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,120
Yes!

156
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,440
This fire reached out to us
and helped us arrive here.

157
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,850
I heard this bell in a storm where
it shouldn't have been audible...

158
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,180
You like this bell's sound, too?

159
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,790
Are you going to grow up to be like
that other giant snake someday?

160
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,570
Probably not for a hundred more years!

161
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,330
Hey! Stay here as long as you like, Noland!

162
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,560
You're the first guests here in
the 400 years since Shandora fell!

163
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,540
I want to treat you with lavish hospitality!

164
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,790
I'd love that! I do want to
collect plants from the forest,

165
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,770
and I want to see this
plague all the way through.

166
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,090
Commodore! Commodore!

167
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,110
Hold on, now. What's with the clothes?

168
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,940
Look, look! An Eternal Pose!

169
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,320
And a map, Commodore! A map!

170
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,070
We took these from intruders.

171
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,390
Is that a map of this island?!

172
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,150
Yeah. This skull shape is
definitely this island.

173
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,860
The name "Shandora"
means "the skull's right eye,"

174
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,980
which refers to this city's location.

175
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,080
Well, take care! Be sure
she gets lots of rest!

176
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,380
Thank you, Doctor!

177
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,850
Hey! Come look, everyone!
Noland's giving us some weird crops!

178
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,350
I have a greenhouse on our ship,
with all kinds of plant samples.

179
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,310
I'll leave some seeds and sprouts
that are suited for your soil.

180
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,460
Is that any good?

181
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,340
Sure is! It's also full of nutrients!

182
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,430
All right! Let's work hard again today!

183
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,640
Work hard doing what?
Having a campfire party?!

184
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,870
Why?! Why would the doctor
and the others do this?!

185
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,550
Chief! Noland and the others are coming!

186
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,740
Listen! Do not speak of last night!

187
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,240
They said they are going
to set sail in a few days.

188
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,540
Do not do anything rash!

189
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,850
I guess we can't understand
each other after all!

190
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,430
No matter how good his
medicine is, he's still a god-killer!

191
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,850
Do they think they're great enough
to stomp all over our history?!

192
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,390
Endure it! Suppress your feelings,
and quietly wait for them to leave!

193
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,610
They're here!

194
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,960
Hey, guys! Is Calgara around?

195
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,170
Why is everyone acting so coldly
all of a sudden? Where's Calgara?

196
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,900
You guys are outsiders!

197
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,630
Calgara doesn't want to see you anymore!

198
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,810
Seto!

199
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,450
When are you gonna leave, anyway?!

200
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,650
Eh?!

201
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,780
They suddenly seem to hate us now...

202
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,710
Hey, hold on, you guys!
You can't just start acting like this!

203
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,490
Stop.

204
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,320
Let's continue our work.

205
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,860
We still have some forest to inspect.

206
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,090
Here you are, Calgara!
Noland was looking for you!

207
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,350
Yeah. I don't want to see his face anymore.

208
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,510
If I do, I think I might kill him!

209
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,550
The bell didn't ring today...

210
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,230
Yeah. It's the first time this's happened
in the month we've been here.

211
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,980
Commodore...

212
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,440
I'll be finished exploring
the forest in two days.

213
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,900
Y-Yes, sir...

214
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,380
Tell the crew we set sail
again in three days,

215
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,120
so now's their last chance to
enjoy solid ground for a while.

216
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,130
Commodore... To be honest, I wanna
get off this awkward island...

217
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,480
Only after we've finished
our duties! Get some sleep.

218
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,130
Live here, Noland!

219
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,620
I know! Why don't you
make Mousse your wife?!

220
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,240
Don't be silly.

221
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,580
I have a family back home, with kids
about her age. I have to go back.

222
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,390
Calgara doesn't want to see you anymore!

223
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,000
When are you gonna leave, anyway?!

224
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,310
I know you're here, Calgara! Come out!

225
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,910
Don't you think this is too one-sided?!

226
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,760
Tell me why! I won't
understand unless you tell me!

227
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,460
We're going to set sail very soon!
I don't want to part ways like this!

228
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,130
Don't show your face around me!

229
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,460
Do you want your wife to end up a widow?!

230
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,540
Calgara!

231
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

232
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

233
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

234
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

235
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

236
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

237
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

238
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

239
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,710
The bell has lost all its meaning!

240
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,470
I only did what satisfied me!

241
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,030
If these were sacrifices
for your "advancements,"

242
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,050
we should never have accepted you!

243
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,050
They're right to be angry.
We have no reason to be forgiven!

244
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,850
We're returning to the Lvneel Kingdom!

245
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,010
On the next episode of One Piece!

246
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,540
"Eternal Friends! The Vowed Bell
Echoes Across the Mighty Seas!!"

247
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
