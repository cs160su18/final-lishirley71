2
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,000
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,900
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

5
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

6
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

7
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,470
After surviving a fierce battle,

8
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,920
the Straw Hats finally entered the New
World, the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

9
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,480
They landed on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen.

10
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,320
After forming an alliance with Trafalgar Law,

11
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,250
Luffy finally encountered Caesar
Clown who rules the island

12
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,650
but was beaten by his mysterious power.

13
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,330
My strong soldiers!

14
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,950
Tie these five up!

15
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,250
Use Sea Prism Stone chains
for the Devil Fruit eaters!

16
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,090
When did you come here?

17
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,510
Vergo!

18
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,520
Just arrived. Luckily, I was at Dressrosa.

19
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,330
I got a ride in an SAD tanker
that was about to leave.

20
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,880
"Shocking! The True Identity
of the Mystery Man Vergo!"

21
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,180
THE ICE LANDS--THE LABORATORY

22
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,130
You have no mercy.

23
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,120
If I had mercy, it wouldn't
make good punishment.

24
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,440
Vergo... The Navy soldiers of the
G-5 are here on the island now.

25
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,100
Since you're their base commander,

26
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,330
I think you're gonna be in
trouble if you run into them.

27
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't try to give me your advice.
You should know your place.

28
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,280
Also, don't make me repeat myself.

29
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,110
You have to address me with "san."

30
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,740
Oh, scary!

31
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,290
THE NEW WORLD--AN ISLAND

32
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,930
Hey, look! Soldiers of the G-5.

33
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,890
Getting drunk and partying in the
daytime? They're so obnoxious!

34
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,390
Do you have a problem?!

35
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,570
This island is safe from pirates
who are worth over 100 million

36
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,240
because we obnoxious soldiers are

37
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,540
going around like this for you
people, don't you think so?!

38
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,860
Huh?!

39
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,080
We deserve to take a little break, don't we?

40
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,750
W-Well...

41
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,090
THE NAVY "G-5" UNIT 06
COMMODORE YARISUGI

42
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,480
It's good! Too good!

43
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,390
Owner, give me a thousand of these!

44
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,680
W-We don't have that many in stock!

45
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,120
What?! Why?! It's too good!

46
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,780
Navy people!

47
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,480
Please! Search for our children!

48
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,600
What are you talking about?

49
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,940
Did you forget?!

50
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,860
Our children went missing three years ago!

51
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,990
Please! Just one more time!

52
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,020
They were just playing in
the neighborhood and then,

53
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,700
they got involved in an accident at sea?!

54
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,660
It doesn't make any sense!

55
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,010
I'm begging you! For one last time!

56
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,720
Please search for them!

57
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,960
Can we talk to the officer
named Captain Tashigi?!

58
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,550
I heard she listens
empathetically to the people!

59
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,050
--I'm begging you! Let us talk to Captain Tashigi!
--Please! One more time!

60
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,310
Cut it out!

61
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,740
How insulting! We're Navy
soldiers of the G-5, too!

62
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,360
First of all, you fools
doubt the Navy's report,

63
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,530
and also complain about us who
are in charge of this area?!

64
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,380
Too much complaining, don't you think?!

65
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,240
I-It's not like that!

66
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,550
It's no use! Too useless!

67
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,620
You have to accept it
already! Too much evidence!

68
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,380
Your children died in an accident!

69
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
Commodore, that's a bit yarisugi (too much).

70
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,860
I asked Vice Admiral Vergo,
the head of the G-5,

71
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,310
about this too many times--a thousand times!

72
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,060
And we investigated ten thousand times!

73
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,770
But...

74
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,710
If you're gonna carry on about this,

75
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,280
I will kill you fools for interfering with us

76
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,610
and burn down your town!

77
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,370
Commodore, that's yarisugi (too much)!

78
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,820
You wanna talk to Tashigi-chan?

79
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,890
Don't push your luck too much!

80
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,490
I mean, it'd be nice if she were
working under me! Too nice!

81
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,170
Imagining too much!

82
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,540
But unfortunately,

83
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,770
she works for Unit 01 as Vice
Admiral Smoker's right-hand girl.

84
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,770
Too right-handy!

85
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,150
She's too busy to deal with you fools

86
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,560
who are obsessed with an
incident from three years ago!

87
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,190
Too busy!

88
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,450
Shitheads!

89
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,910
That's too much!

90
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,840
They're not gonna listen to us!

91
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,460
I wonder if it's true that Vice
Admiral Vergo knows about this.

92
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,210
He saved this island from pirates once.

93
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,650
I couldn't believe that he was
part of that rough group, the G-5,

94
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,470
because he was such a gentleman!

95
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,330
He thinks that it was an accident, too?!

96
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,190
They are still alive!

97
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,030
Our children are still alive.

98
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,400
Somewhere in this world!

99
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,410
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND

100
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,080
THE REMAINS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND
LABORATORY NAMI AND USOPP'S GROUP

101
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,840
My head is gonna explode!

102
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,130
Usopp, make them fall asleep already!

103
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm doing it but it's not
gonna work that many times!

104
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,260
Unchain me, brothers!

105
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,330
I guess the withdrawal
symptoms are way too painful!

106
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,110
Then, what should we do?!

107
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,820
Just do everything we can!
I'm counting on you, Sanji!

108
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm Nami!

109
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,720
Oh, that's right!

110
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,780
Damn, you look so dependable on the outside!

111
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,160
I'm sorry!

112
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,790
Brothers!

113
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,330
Candy... Give me the candy!

114
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,210
Candy! Candy!

115
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,340
My head hurts!

116
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,690
I can't stand it!

117
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,430
The candy will stop this pain!

118
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,510
Candy!

119
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,990
Candy! Candy! Candy!

120
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,210
I'm begging you!

121
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,360
Why can't you give it to me?!

122
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,270
Give me the candy!

123
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,130
They're coming!

124
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,760
Can I... Can I attack them
now?! They're like monsters!

125
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,300
No! Don't be ridiculous, they're just kids!

126
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,090
But we can't just run around like this!

127
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,730
Master!

128
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,740
Are you okay, children?

129
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,910
Let's go back to the laboratory!

130
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,820
It's dangerous here.

131
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,510
It's the candy!

132
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,450
Master!

133
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,580
Master!

134
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,870
Master!

135
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,090
Master! Master! Master!

136
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,920
Master?

137
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,560
THE MIDDLE LAKE

138
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,980
The Slime got mad!

139
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,670
Why, all of a sudden?

140
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,920
Probably because those
small Slimes were blown up.

141
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,010
They were like a parent and its children?

142
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,540
But I had no choice.

143
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,880
He's transforming!

144
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,470
What is that?!

145
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,120
What? Is it a frog?

146
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,570
Looks like a lizard to me.

147
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,000
Run!

148
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,780
He can make as many copies
of himself as he wants?!

149
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,250
No, it looks like the one on
the other side is shrinking.

150
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,030
It means that one will disappear in the end?

151
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,550
Maybe he's flinging pieces of
himself over to cross the lake!

152
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,330
We don't want that monster
to run wild on this side!

153
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,020
You're right! If we cut it, it spews
gas. If we burn it, it explodes.

154
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,380
And it's way bigger than
the ones from before!

155
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,050
The lab could be in danger, too!

156
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,300
What? Then, we'd better hurry!

157
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,360
Momonosuke!

158
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,580
What are you guys gonna
do?! I'm going to the lab!

159
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,650
Then we gotta go, too! Idiot!

160
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,380
Who're you calling "idiot"?!

161
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,860
You're such a pain!

162
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,080
If you get separated from
Kin'emon and wander off,

163
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,480
we have to look for you all over the island!

164
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,800
You can't fight now, Zoro-san, Sanji-san!

165
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,540
I want to see his swordplay, too!

166
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,430
Let's go to the lab!

167
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,760
You awake?

168
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,700
What are you doing here?

169
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,680
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

170
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,600
It looks like we're all captured.

171
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,540
Oh, we're in a cell?!

172
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,650
When did that happen?

173
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,190
Oh, you're here, too, Smokey!

174
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,860
It's no use. That's Sea Prism Stone chain.

175
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,950
You're awake, huh?

176
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,330
What is she?

177
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,630
You all look better than I thought.

178
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,050
What?! You're...

179
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,340
You're the head of the G-5!
Why the hell are you here?!

180
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,940
Vergo!

181
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,490
Give us back Smo-yan, Caesar!

182
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,280
CAESAR'S LABORATORY - THE FRONT

183
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,040
Give us back Tashigi-chan!

184
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,690
All clear!

185
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,340
Alright, close the shutters!

186
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,330
Don't let the Navy soldiers in at any cost!

187
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,090
As soon as everybody gets
in, activate it immediately!

188
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,080
What?!

189
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,020
Wh-What is it?!

190
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,660
Wh-What the hell is that?!

191
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,220
They're closing the entrance!

192
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,040
Dammit! It was too late!

193
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,240
Open it! Assholes!

194
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,940
Let me handle this!

195
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,050
The shutter is too thick!
It's as solid as rock!

196
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,070
Even a bazooka doesn't work?!

197
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,900
What about the back entrance?!

198
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,950
It's all closed! The shutters
were down everywhere!

199
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,980
Damn, that gas bastard!

200
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,830
Hey, looks like we've been trapped, huh?

201
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,210
Don't be ridiculous!

202
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:12,130
Because, although those creepy
jellies stopped falling suddenly,

203
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,510
if you take a good look, they're merging
into one another and getting bigger!

204
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,850
We can't steal another ship! All
the paths have been cut off!

205
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,190
They took our Transponder Snails
away so we can't make a call!

206
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,270
What should we do?!

207
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,770
All the shutters are closed!

208
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,150
Okay.

209
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,360
Clank.

210
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,950
Sounds like they're moving
ahead with preparations.

211
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,660
Poor Navy soldiers.

212
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,210
What is Caesar up to?

213
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,760
Well, I don't know exactly

214
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,450
but he woke his pet Smiley up so...

215
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,220
...I think he's planning
to do a big experiment.

216
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,990
Looks like it's going to
be a very dangerous one.

217
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,550
By the way, Vergo,

218
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,710
did you eat a hamburger this morning?

219
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,900
How did you know? It's my favorite.

220
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,440
There is a piece of it still
stuck beside your mouth.

221
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,980
I would like to see the
experiment before I go.

222
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,870
Everyone outside will die?

223
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,620
Probably. But you will be safe in here.

224
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,250
Hey, Vergo!

225
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,990
They're all Navy soldiers of the G-5 outside!

226
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,550
Your subordinates!

227
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,550
Are you gonna leave them to die?!

228
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,550
Yeah, I think so.

229
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,720
What did he just say?!

230
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,640
Anyway,

231
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,190
I can't believe there are
such big names in one cell.

232
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,560
I like the view.

233
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,080
It brings back memories.

234
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,320
To see you two in the same cell.

235
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,330
Oh yeah, Smokey and I got caught
by you and the others at Alabasta!

236
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,890
Shut up, you fools!

237
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,200
You people can never read the atmosphere!

238
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,890
Smoker-san, I don't know what to
do with this feeling right now!

239
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,670
You were right and this is
the worst-case scenario.

240
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,190
Those news articles were false...

241
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,470
...meaning somebody in the G-5 covered
up those child abduction cases.

242
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,930
So Caesar abducted those kids and...

243
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,520
...Vergo covered it up as accidents at sea.

244
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,600
Of all others, the head of
the base was a double agent.

245
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,740
That's characteristic of G-5 in a
way but it's a dishonor to the Navy!

246
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,410
How dare you?!

247
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,440
What? Is he a bad person?

248
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,250
It seems like he is.

249
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,570
No wonder you didn't notice it.

250
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,260
It's not like Vergo was selling the Navy out.

251
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,260
He was a pirate originally.

252
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,980
A pirate... You were?!

253
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,670
That's right.

254
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,770
Before he made his name, he
joined the Navy by Joker's order

255
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:21,110
and spent fifteen years climbing
up the ranks from the very bottom.

256
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,990
There is no Navy soldier who is more
reliable and convenient for Joker than him.

257
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,080
Vergo had been working for
Joker from the very start!

258
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,580
No way!

259
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,660
Joker is a name of an underworld
broker if I'm correct.

260
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,720
I feel so pathetic! I can't believe I
didn't smell this rat so close to me!

261
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,550
Don't be so negative.

262
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,730
Why don't you just praise the rat for
eluding the eyes of the great "White Chase,"

263
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,560
Smoker-kun.

264
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,610
From the day that you transferred from the
headquarters, I was on the highest alert.

265
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,150
I'm so happy that now I can
free myself from that stress.

266
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,150
Anyway, you blabbed out so much, Law.

267
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,450
Didn't I punish you enough?

268
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,120
But that's okay.

269
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,050
You said that I'd be in trouble in
case I ran into the G-5 soldiers

270
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,880
but that's not true.

271
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,010
I have been taming them for a long time
- I don't think they would suspect me.

272
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,100
Even if they find out about
my background like this,

273
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,060
I know what to do.

274
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,810
You know what I mean, don't you?

275
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,820
Vice Admiral Smoker, Captain Tashigi.

276
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,370
You two will die here

277
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,960
so you can keep your mouths shut forever.

278
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,920
And I'll let Caesar handle
those soldiers outside.

279
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,290
It's inevitable. This is
Joker's important territory.

280
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,390
I can't just let those who learn
about his identity walk away.

281
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,480
Don't worry. I will process it
as an accident like I always did.

282
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,230
Vergo!

283
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,230
Hey, Tra-guy, who's Joker?

284
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,680
I was working for him, too, once.

285
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,540
Huh?

286
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,120
That's why I knew Vergo.

287
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,750
Joker is just his alias
as an underground broker.

288
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,600
His true identity?  He's a
man that you know very well.

289
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,010
What do you mean?

290
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,260
One of the seven most notorious pirates.

291
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,720
He is a member of the Seven Warlords
authorized by the World Government.

292
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,280
He is Don Quixote Doflamingo.

293
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,970
The revelation of the name, Doflamingo,
one of the Seven Warlords, causes quite the stir.

294
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,210
With the children in tow, Nami and
the others are already at a disadvantage,

295
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,470
and are put in an even bigger life-or-death situation

296
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,020
due to the Gas Gas Fruit's fearsome power.

297
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,690
"Save the Children!
The Master's Evil Hands Close in!"

299
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,790
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
