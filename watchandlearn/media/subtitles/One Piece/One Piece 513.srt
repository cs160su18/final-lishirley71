00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,500
Luffy lost his brother Ace in the
War of the Best against the Navy.

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,570
He sent a message to his crew

61
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,990
in a manner that no one
else would understand.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,370
I hope that they'll get it.

63
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,830
They'll get it if they see the article.

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,210
They will understand you very well.

65
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,960
I have a feeling.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,920
Oh yeah! I got it, Luffy!

67
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,180
I got it now! Okay! Okay!

68
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,220
I see. That's what it is.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,230
Roger that, Luffy.

70
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,810
I see, Luffy!

71
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,310
I got it!

72
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,190
I got it, Luffy!

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,780
Honestly! He's not thinking
about how we feel - how selfish!

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,700
I see!

75
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,160
Oh, is that what it's all about?

76
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,540
Luffy doesn't do these kind of things.

77
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,160
He's with Rayleigh - it
must be Rayleigh's idea.

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,960
I know there is a catch.

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,100
"Pirates Get on the Move!
Astounding New World!"

80
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,560
Since Whitebeard's era ended,

81
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,650
GRAND LINE - NEAR THE SABAODY ARCHIPELAGO

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,650
ambitious pirates have begun
to stir in audacious ways.

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,530
But not Trafalgar Law...

84
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,450
--Huh? We're not gonna go there yet?!
--Let's go to the New World already!

85
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,170
How much longer are
we gonna hang around here?

86
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,160
What are you waiting for, Captain?

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,370
I said we're going to wait for our time.

88
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,130
TRAFALGAR LAW

89
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,830
Don't worry.

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,130
The great One Piece treasure
won't go anywhere.

91
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,680
But Blackbeard's already started
making moves in the New World

92
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,260
and there's a rumor he
destroyed a pirate crew!

93
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,480
Big time rookies who want to
become one of The Four Emperors

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,270
are rushing to the New World!

95
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,150
There's no time to lose! We'll
be beaten by everybody else!

96
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,400
It's better for us if they're
trying to destroy one another.

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,050
We won't get involved in those petty fights.

98
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,240
Stop griping and just follow me.

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,080
We'll get what we want at any cost!

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,540
--Captain!
--We will follow you forever!

101
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,600
Aye-aye, Captain! You can count on me...

102
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,420
Sleep talking?!

103
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,090
--I'm sorry.
--Don't apologize while you're asleep!

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
NEW WORLD--SOME WINTER ISLAND

105
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,310
It's so cold! My body's gonna freeze!

106
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,090
Is anybody here at a place like this?

107
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,530
X. DRAKE

108
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,620
--What's that?!
--Something's falling from the sky!

109
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,500
Oh no! Run!

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,090
Guys, are you okay?!

111
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,050
I'm fine over here.

112
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,050
Damn! What's going on on this island?

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,350
Captain, let's pull out of this island!

114
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,300
I don't think anybody's living here!

115
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,440
You don't think so?

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Anything can happen in this sea.

117
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
Look at it.

118
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,110
What's that semiround pile of snow?

119
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,320
The icicles are stuck in it!

120
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,490
It's not a pile of snow! It's an iron dome!

121
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,330
Look! The dome is opening up!

122
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,570
I didn't expect to see a town in the dome.

123
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:59,160
The famous Kaido-san of The Four
Emperors, loves this island.

124
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,250
And I'm in charge of security here.

125
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,870
And? What do you want from us?

126
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,420
Nothing. I just warned you.

127
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,720
You better not piss him off, rookie.

128
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,460
You mean, if I kill you or something,

129
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,470
Kaido won't leave me alone?

130
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,770
That's right. So why don't you...

131
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,430
That makes it easier for me!

132
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,940
Oh? An ancient Zoan type? How rare!

133
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,680
Scratch! Boom!

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,250
NEW WORLD--SOME SPRING ISLAND

135
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,250
Check it out!

136
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,170
SCRATCHMEN APOO

137
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,840
That was a pain in the butt!

138
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,480
--That's our Captain Apoo!
--So dependable!

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,310
--There are still that many?!
--You gotta be kidding!

140
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,230
Oh no...

141
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,610
Guys, don't worry! Captain Apoo will save us!

142
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,200
--Listen, guys!
--Yeah!

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,240
--Let's run!
--What?!

144
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,370
I can't beat that big group of violent boars!

145
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,460
Captain, there's only a dead end ahead of us!

146
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,300
Save yourselves however you can!

147
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,920
--Oh no! We're dead!
--Don't give up!

148
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,960
But we're gonna fall into the water!

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,930
Who cares! Jump!

150
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,180
What?!

151
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,270
Huh?

152
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,060
Captain, we're running in the air!

153
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,270
The boars are coming
after us in the air, too!

154
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,610
I can see that! What's
wrong with this island?!

155
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,570
It's hot!

156
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,450
SAN JUAN WOLF

157
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,450
My legs can't take it anymore.

158
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,960
My body's exhausted.

159
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,880
Ouch, some fish bit me.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,170
NEW WORLD - SOME BURNING ISLAND

161
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,050
Stop complaining, Wolf!

162
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,170
The raft was almost broken because of you.

163
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,510
That's why we're doing this.

164
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,640
It was so reckless to try crossing the
New World by raft in the first place.

165
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,900
MARSHALL D. TEACH

166
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,900
We should've taken a Navy ship at Marineford.

167
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,570
But you can't help becoming
attached to things.

168
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,570
JESUS BURGESS

169
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,070
SHIRYU

170
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,070
You guys don't prepare for anything.

171
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,180
Let me handle it!

172
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,910
AVALO PIZARRO

173
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,910
You want me to be captain, Teach?

174
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,210
LAFITTE

175
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,180
Shut up or I'll kill you.

176
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,210
We're Blackbeard Pirates.

177
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:53,540
Heaven knows what'll happen to us... Oh...

178
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,540
DOC Q

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,590
VASCO SHOT

180
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,550
I need more drinks!

181
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,590
Can we go to an island with a town?

182
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,850
CATARINA DEVON

183
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,590
Yeah, I'd prefer some
gorgeous outfit to a ship!

184
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm sick of this jail clothing.

185
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,850
You have to live with it.

186
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,730
I can't live with it forever.

187
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,280
Me, neither! How much longer should we wait?!

188
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,070
Is the Navy coming?

189
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,660
VAN AUGER

190
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,120
I'll go and look. They can't be this slow.

191
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,880
No, they can't!

192
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,910
These guys are getting tired of waiting.

193
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,920
Right, Jewelry Bonney?

194
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,510
JEWELRY BONNEY

195
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,620
Captain Bonney...

196
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,470
I can't believe they put a price of
over 100 million on a girl like you!

197
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,390
The New World is the sea
for the chosen strong ones.

198
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,900
Although you came all the
way from the South Blue,

199
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,720
you can't go any further.

200
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,700
You're too weak to join my crew but...

201
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,000
How about this? You can come
with me if you become my girl.

202
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,250
To go further. Huh?

203
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,670
Screw you!

204
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,210
You bearded pig!

205
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,990
He got turned down.

206
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,220
No good! You're indecent! Women
need to have some decency!

207
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,520
I already have an indecent crew!

208
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,350
Thank you for saying that!

209
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,430
Let's just give her over to the Navy

210
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,320
and get a ship in exchange as we planned!

211
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,200
Captain. The Navy is coming.

212
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,390
They brought a ship for us?

213
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,200
They brought one but they
won't give it to us.

214
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,660
Huh? How can you tell?

215
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,330
Because Akainu is on it.

216
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,920
Damn! That's not what I want now.

217
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,340
Let's go, guys!

218
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,800
We messed this one up!

219
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,470
--Did you catch Blackbeard?
--He's gone!

220
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,100
When I heard that you escaped
from the Government,

221
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,850
it made my blood freeze.

222
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,280
But it's all over now.

223
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,200
You bastards! I won't forgive you!

224
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,830
THE HOLYLAND OF MARIE JOIS

225
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,040
Disappeared?

226
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,250
Yeah, to be honest.

227
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,590
Whose idea was this?! Sengoku?!

228
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,630
No, someone much higher up the ladder!

229
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,020
It's not a metaphor. Literally,
it was like "poof."

230
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,100
I was surprised. Is that the
power of the Shadow-Shadow Fruit?

231
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,690
It's no joke!

232
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,240
Don't worry. He was dying.

233
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,530
Nothing can save his life.

234
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,840
That's right. Unless he arises as a zombie.

235
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,620
Well, he looks like one!

236
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,540
You've done such sloppy work!

237
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,130
Hey, don't get cocky!

238
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,500
When did you become my boss?

239
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,680
No matter how powerful you are
in the Government, I'm a pirate!

240
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,700
It doesn't matter to me!

241
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,930
When I lose interest in doing
business with you guys,

242
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,560
I'll quit as a Warlord anytime!

243
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,560
Don't ever forget that.

244
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,290
SOUTH BLUE - BIRDIE KINGDOM

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,290
Meanwhile, at the Birdie Kingdom...

246
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,640
Each of the Straw Hats has begun
moving in different places as well...

247
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,800
Racoon is gone now.

248
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,850
The birds feel the same way we do.

249
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,650
We're looking forward to
see you again, Racoon!

250
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,150
Now, let's get back to work.

251
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,460
Ah? What is it?

252
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,610
That's...!

253
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,130
--The bird came back!
--Huh? It's too soon!

254
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,720
--Oh? I don't see Racoon.
--What happened to Racoon?

255
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,020
--Maybe he fell into the water!
--That's not good! Let's go look for...

256
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,110
Wh-Who is it?

257
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,170
As a matter of fact, in order
to defend peace in the world,

258
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,660
I fight evil because I'm the
hero of justice - Chopper Mask!

259
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,870
Ra-Racoon!

260
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,050
I know I said "come see us again"
but isn't it a little bit too soon?

261
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,680
No, you're wrong! I'm not him!

262
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,840
Maybe we look alike but I'm
his friend--Chopper Mask!

263
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,010
It's too obvious, Racoon.

264
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,020
You're wearing a disguise because
you feel embarrassed to come back?

265
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,560
No! I said I'm...

266
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,780
Are you okay, Racoon?

267
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,450
Don't make me repeat myself!
I'm his friend and I'm...

268
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,450
You guys, don't be such jerks.

269
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,370
You gotta play along on these occasions.

270
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,580
--We got confused!
--Yeah, that's right!

271
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:10,380
--So you're Chopper Mask! Cool!
--Yeah, you don't look anything like Chopper!

272
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,710
Sorry, sorry, we were...

273
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,010
That's enough! It's too pitiful!

274
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,340
Oh, Racoon!

275
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,400
That tickles! You fool!

276
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,190
The thing is, I suddenly have something that
I need to do.

277
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,920
Can I stay a little longer?

278
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,330
Whatever the reason, you're always welcome!

279
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,070
There are many plants

280
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,770
that I've never seen in any
book growing on that big tree.

281
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,960
Let me study them.

282
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,460
Then we have a suitable place for that.

283
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,030
I need to improve my strength, too.

284
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,510
I have a lot to do.

285
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,350
Oh, Racoon! You're back already?

286
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,890
That's great!

287
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,480
You guys, I'm gonna stay
on this island for a while!

288
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,070
Okay, this is it.

289
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,920
What's this place?

290
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,240
This is...

291
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,520
...the library of our
village. You can study here.

292
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,640
So many books!

293
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,630
There are more! To the very end!

294
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,950
Cool!

295
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,470
All these books are about the plants
and the medicines that I wanna study!

296
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,310
And there're so many!

297
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,770
There are so many plants on this island
that you can make medicine out of.

298
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,590
And we knew how to make them
but the birds were in our way

299
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,740
so we couldn't get the plants and
make medicine - we were stuck.

300
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,620
I was judging the people on
this island by their looks

301
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,580
but when I think about it, their
weapons are very high-tech.

302
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,830
They look like they're dumb but...

303
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,710
...their cultural level is pretty high!

304
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,130
I have a lot to learn!

305
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,630
Racoon!

306
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,140
You thought you were saying that to
yourself, but you actually said it.

307
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,030
And that was very rude...

308
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,250
I wonder how much I can do in this country...

309
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,190
Hey, what's that thing?!

310
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,150
It must be the Snowman!

311
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,870
It's dangerous! Tell the
kids to get in the house.

312
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,610
Gun! Bring me the gun!

313
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,620
Kill it! Go away, monster!

314
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,280
Don't let it come any closer! Kill it now!

315
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,400
--It's the Snowman!
--Kill it!

316
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,760
--Don't let it get away!
--Kill it!

317
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,350
Skull?

318
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,730
This is a symbol of the belief
that nothing is impossible.

319
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,530
By raising this, I'll fight
just like pirates do!

320
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,700
It's cool to be a pirate!

321
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,870
There're tons of incredible guys at sea!

322
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,700
Chopper, go out to sea some day.

323
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,120
If you do, you'll understand very
well how small your problems are.

324
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,210
This island you were born on is
like this compared to the world.

325
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,260
Really?

326
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,880
No, it's smaller! Like this! It's true!

327
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,770
Your future lies beyond that sea!

328
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,730
Hey! Let's be pirates together!

329
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,490
It's true... that I wanna be a pirate but...

330
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,700
I'm not even a human! I'm a monster!

331
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,760
I can't become your friend! So...!

332
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,380
So I just came to say thank you...

333
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,900
I do appreciate you guys.

334
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,550
Thank you for asking me to join you.

335
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,170
I'll stay here, but...

336
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,360
one day... if you feel
like it, stop by agai...

337
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,800
Shut up! Let's go!

338
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,350
Luffy took me out to sea.

339
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,200
I was desperate to just follow him.

340
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,200
Have I done anything to help Luffy?

341
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,510
I don't wanna go through that again.

342
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,550
But, at that time...

343
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,990
Luffy must have felt more
pain than the rest of us!

344
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,880
Because he let me join his crew,

345
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,380
I no longer care what people say to me!

346
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,040
If it helps him,

347
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,180
I can become a real monster!

348
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,230
Chopper!

349
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,140
Chopper!

350
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,500
Chopper!

351
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,120
Luffy!

352
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,150
I promise you that I'm gonna get stronger!

353
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,700
Luffy's friends have received his messages.

354
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,970
Nami, in Weatheria,

355
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,680
and Franky, in Baldimore, take
action in their own ways.

356
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,140
And Sanji, in Kamabakka Kingdom,

357
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,810
throws his all into an epic battle to learn a
secret handed down in the kingdom for generations!

358
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,350
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,730
"Living through Hell! Sanji's
Fight for His Manhood!"

360
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
