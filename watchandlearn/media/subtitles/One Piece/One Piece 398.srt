2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,980
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,450
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,970
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,310
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,770
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,710
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,170
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,220
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,540
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,720
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,640
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,180
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,450
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,530
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,350
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,160
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,710
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,600
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,690
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,450
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,260
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,470
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,710
The Straw Hat crew landed
on the Sabaody Archipelago

51
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,700
to search for a ship coating craftsman
to help them reach Fish-Man Island.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,160
During the adventure, Camie, a mermaid
who was with them, was kidnapped

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,270
and about to be sold as a slave.

54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,750
Luffy, after storming the
auction house to save her...

55
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,230
Quit your squirming!

56
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,980
Damn...!

57
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,480
Now you die!

58
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,080
I've been wanting to meet you...

59
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,230
...Monkey D. Luffy.

60
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,750
"Admiral Kizaru Takes Action! Sabaody
Archipelago Thrown into Chaos"

61
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,140
This is bad! This town-- this
whole archipelago-- is in danger!

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,080
Straw Hat Luffy supposedly kicked
a Celestial Dragon's ass!

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,110
At the auction house on Grove #1!

64
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,610
What?!

65
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,780
Apparently Kid and Law are there, too!

66
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,090
That Straw Hat bastard!
What was he thinking?!

67
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,960
Doesn't he know that an admiral
from Navy Headquarters

68
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,660
will bring a warship here if
anyone hurts a Celestial Dragon?!

69
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,470
Has our ship been coated?!

70
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,330
It was completed yesterday!

71
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,430
We set sail for Fish-Man Island immediately!

72
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,870
We can't just sit around
while an admiral shows up!

73
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,430
Yes, sir!

74
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,700
Captain! Let's get out of here!

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,880
There's no point in staying here!

76
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,430
Guess that dumbass's captain
is an even bigger dumbass!

77
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,730
If I ever run into 'em in the
New World... I'll destroy 'em!

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,820
Causing trouble with Navy Headquarters
with the New World right in sight...

79
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,830
What a truly troublesome lot they are...

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,740
Focus on getting ready to set sail.

81
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,870
Yes, sir! Right away, Captain Drake!

82
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,520
Now, then. Who's going to show up?

83
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,480
Given the situation, I somehow doubt
this is an all-out arrest plot.

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,810
It's Straw Hat Luffy they're after, right?

85
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,120
I think I'd like to see what
an admiral is actually like.

86
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,730
You can't be serious, Apoo-san!
Let's just get out of here!

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,320
Captain Hawkins! It's dangerous
here! Let's set sail immediately!

88
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,870
Calm down.

89
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,250
I am not destined to die today.

90
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,040
"Holy Land of Marie Jois"

91
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,970
That brat again?! It's one
thing after the other!

92
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,470
What's with that entire family's bloodline?!

93
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,470
Reports indicate the presence
of the Straw Hat crew,

94
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,120
Eustass Captain Kid and his crew,
and Trafalgar Law and his crew.

95
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,660
Thirteen people with bounties
have been confirmed!

96
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,270
Of them, five are rookies
worth over 100 million each!

97
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,140
Naturally, the key offender
appears to be Monkey D. Luffy,

98
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,280
who assaulted the Celestial Dragons!

99
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,410
We've lost contact with the
guards at the Human Shop--

100
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,350
oh, I mean Employment Office.

101
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,540
I believe they may have all been subdued...

102
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,500
In any case, this act of taking
three Celestial Dragons hostage

103
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,640
is a vile and unprecedented transgression!

104
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
Have they made any demands?

105
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,340
No, none at the moment...

106
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,020
Whatever the case may be, Sengoku-san,
we'll need to take action

107
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,310
given that World Nobles are the victims here.

108
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,400
Kizaru...

109
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,430
Allow me to go. Rest easy; I won't be long.

110
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,680
"Justice"

111
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,380
This is no laughing matter!

112
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,980
This is your shop, you know!

113
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,880
Mister Doflamingo...!
Where are you right now?!

114
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,990
The shop has lost all credibility, and
then there's Roswald's family too!

115
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,600
They're definitely going to lash out at us!

116
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,510
Do something to fix things!

117
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,130
Seriously... Human trafficking
is so old-fashioned, you idiot.

118
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,300
It's all about smiles now! Smiles!

119
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,920
Disco, I'm giving the shop to you.

120
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,970
So don't be callin' me anymore!

121
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,940
What?! You're abandoning us during
the worst crisis we've ever had?!

122
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,070
Quiet, you annoying bastard!

123
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,670
While you sit there blaming
me for your own misfortune

124
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,110
a "New Era" draws ever closer, Disco-kun.

125
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,440
The navy has given orders forcing
me-- no, us-- into active duty!

126
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,340
Knowing this, what do you see
on the horizon, Disco-kun?

127
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,600
The Whitebeard Pirates versus
the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

128
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,120
Please evacuate as far away as you can!

129
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,120
No watching, please! These
are dangerous people!

130
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,860
The slave I bought is still inside!

131
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,700
Have the mortars arrived yet?

132
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,630
Yes, most of them! We're
hurrying to set them up!

133
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,570
Has HQ said anything?

134
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,090
That Admiral Kizaru is coming, but
the vanguard will consist of...

135
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,550
Of them?! They're coming here?!

136
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,810
Yes, sir! That's what they said...

137
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,660
I'm going to remove your collar
now. Are you ready, girl?

138
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,050
Hold on, old man! Don't
be crazy! It'll explode!

139
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,550
We've seen a slave's collar explode before!

140
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,310
That's a bad idea! A very bad idea!

141
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,600
Are you sure about this, Luffy?!

142
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,000
W-Wait! Franky is looking
for the key as we speak!

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,860
We should really wait until he
finds it and brings it back!

144
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,910
Yeah! Stop him, Straw Hat!

145
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,650
Damn! Not here, either!

146
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,540
Dammit!

147
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,090
It'll be all right. Just stay still.

148
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,950
I dunno what kind of power he used...

149
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,950
...but the one thing for sure is
that he's no ordinary old man!

150
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,840
And that somehow means it's okay
to leave Camie-chan in his hands?!

151
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,710
Dammit! What's Franky doing?!

152
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,170
I'm telling you, it's too dangerous!
It won't come off without the key!

153
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,680
It's ringing! What're we gonna do?!

154
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,990
Stop! Stop it!

155
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,490
Camie!

156
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,640
Hold on! I'm coming!

157
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,840
What?!

158
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,310
Hey! What was that?!

159
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,260
See, I told you! Now Camie's...!

160
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,320
What's all this now?!
Don't scare me like that!

161
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
Your collar and handcuffs are already off!

162
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,660
It came off...

163
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,090
C-Camie!

164
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,090
Camie! Thank goodness!

165
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,110
What the hell?! I finally manage
to find 'em, but then...!

166
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,970
Oh! You found them? Well done!

167
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,980
But we no longer need them.
Here, you carry this girl.

168
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,690
U-Umm... Th-Thanks!

169
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,540
What in the hell's going on
here?! Who are you, anyway?!

170
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,350
Huh? What did he do?

171
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,470
That geezer did something mysterious again!

172
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,650
Just who is that old guy?!

173
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,950
Stop! Stop it!

174
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,360
He took the collar off barehanded?!

175
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,320
Hey, almost-slaves!

176
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,590
All the buyers took off! You
should scram while you can, too!

177
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,310
Here!

178
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,480
If that geezer took out these
guards all at once too,

179
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,280
then he must know how to use
magic or some type of sorcery!

180
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,790
He's got powers or something!

181
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,600
He said something about
your straw hat, though...

182
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,740
That straw hat suits dauntless men very well.

183
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,280
I've been wanting to meet you...

184
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,200
...Monkey D. Luffy.

185
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,030
How do you know him, Luffy?!

186
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,180
I don't know him! Really!

187
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,500
I think he used what's called "Haki."

188
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,140
I don't know much about it either, though...

189
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,590
Sorry about that, fellows. I didn't
realize other pirates were watching.

190
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,890
You must be quite strong to have
withstood that with no problem at all.

191
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,520
I never expected to meet
such a big-shot here...

192
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,480
"Dark King" Silvers Rayleigh...

193
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,350
No doubt about it. What's a legendary
man doing in a place like this?

194
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,480
On these islands I'm Ray-san,
the coating craftsman.

195
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,810
Don't go calling me that other name.

196
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm an old soldier now. I just
want to live in peace and quiet.

197
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,780
I take it you'll survive, Hachi?

198
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,380
After I told you all those times
not to walk around these islands...

199
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
I'm sorry...

200
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,770
Thanks for saving my friend, fellows.

201
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,590
So, what's this about wanting
to meet me, old guy?

202
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,430
Yes, let's save that for later.
We first need to get out of here.

203
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,470
They have the place completely
surrounded, Boss.

204
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,310
Alright, you criminals! Release
the Roswald family at once!

205
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,980
An admiral will be arriving shortly!
I recommend immediate surrender!

206
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,040
Don't blame us for whatever
happens, you rookies!

207
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,620
We're not only caught up in this, we're
being treated as accomplices now.

208
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,610
I got a good glimpse of the insanity
that makes Straw Hat Luffy so notorious.

209
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,130
I have no complaints, but I'd rather not
run into an admiral now if I can avoid it!

210
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,550
Oh, I'd prefer not to use that power of
mine anymore, so I leave this to you!

211
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,850
It'll be hard for me to stay settled
down if the navy discovers who I am.

212
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,810
I have no intention of helping
out a senior citizen!

213
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,320
The longer we stay here, the
more troops there'll be!

214
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,690
I think I'll go on ahead!

215
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,670
While I'm at it, I'll help you guys out too!

216
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,530
I'll clean things up outside, so don't worry!

217
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,760
I told you, I'll do it!

218
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,830
Shut up!

219
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm gonna do it!

220
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,450
Get outta here!

221
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,500
Shut up, you guys!

222
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,870
I'm going to do it.

223
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,540
What're you talking about?!

224
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,020
I told you, leave it to me!

225
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,360
No! I'm gonna do it!

226
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,530
Don't tell me what to do!

227
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,020
You guys just don't get it!

228
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,490
You're the one who doesn't get it!

229
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,670
Alright!

230
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,960
You guys can go back inside!

231
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,760
Hey! Are you even listening?!
I told you two to stay back!

232
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,020
Tell me what to do again and I'll start
by getting rid of you, Eustass-ya!

233
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,200
Get ready!

234
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,030
All three of them are captains!
They're spearheading the attack!

235
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,340
Monkey D. Luffy, worth 300 million!

236
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,450
I'm going!

237
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,850
Eustass Captain Kid, worth 315 million!

238
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,790
Let me handle it.

239
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,690
Trafalgar Law, worth 200 million!

240
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,830
You can stay here and
bicker all you want. I...

241
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,900
...can handle this all by myself!

242
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,840
All three of them have bounties
well over 100 million!

243
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,740
Geez, they're so simpleminded!

244
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,880
Hey! There's gonna an all-out brawl!

245
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,640
Let's use that chance to escape! We
can't just sit around here anyway!

246
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,560
Hatchin...

247
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,850
Thanks... I'm sorry for
causing you trouble...!

248
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,730
Never mind me! I'm just
glad you're all right!

249
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,370
Camie! It's my fault this happened to you!

250
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,960
I shouldn't have let you
go to the amusement park!

251
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,390
No, I'll always cherish the memory
of going to the amusement park!

252
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,120
There's no reason to apologize, Pappagu!

253
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,910
Straw Hat said the same thing, actually...

254
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,380
Eh?

255
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,460
What're you guys talking about?

256
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,630
There isn't one thing you
guys should be sorry for!

257
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,060
All three of you are my friends now!

258
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,070
We will rescue Camie, no matter what!

259
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,100
So stop crying!

260
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,620
Luffy-chin...

261
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,990
Let's follow them. We're going
to break through in one go.

262
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,860
All right, then.

263
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,330
Let us meet up on Grove #13, should
we find ourselves separated.

264
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,760
Grove #13? Got it!

265
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,180
You don't "got it" at all!

266
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,200
What will you do, Mr. Giant?!

267
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,790
We were all on the verge of becoming slaves.

268
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm going to flee somewhere
with these people!

269
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,580
I see! Be careful not to
draw attention to yourself!

270
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,610
Old man! Straw Hat's friends!

271
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,470
I will repay this favor if we
ever meet again! Thank you!

272
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,490
Thanks so much!

273
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,990
Thank you!

274
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,550
Sure, no problem!

275
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,270
You're taking credit?!

276
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,430
Mortars! Fire!

277
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,110
Gum-Gum...

278
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,940
...Balloon!

279
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,240
Repel!

280
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,910
Room.

281
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,120
Wh-What's this circle?!

282
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,410
Shambles.

283
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,850
I've been killed!

284
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,580
Wait... Huh?!

285
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,260
Watch out! All three of 'em have powers!

286
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,810
Leave enough people to rescue the
hostages, and gather all our men here!

287
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,890
Mortars, too!

288
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,430
Ready! Aim!

289
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,940
W-Wait! Please wait!

290
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,690
Don't either of you do anything!
You'll just get in the way!

291
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,920
I already told you! Tell me what to do and--

292
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,740
Leave it to me!

293
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,680
Fire! Fire! Fire!

294
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,040
Gum-Gum Finger Net!

295
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,150
He can stretch?!

296
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,250
What kind of weird power is that?

297
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,240
What are you doing?!

298
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,180
I thought I was a goner!

299
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,330
Sorry!

300
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,060
Straw Hat! You really are
screwed up in the head!

301
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,610
Start with Straw Hat Luffy! Charge!

302
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,490
Damn, you! Fire! Fire! Fire!

303
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,910
Now! Stay sharp! Go! Go!

304
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,830
Gum-Gum Whip!

305
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,240
Don't falter! Fire!

306
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,920
Oh no!

307
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,180
That was close...!

308
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,620
Now! Get him!

309
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,480
Huh?

310
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,010
Toward himself?!

311
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,610
Does he want to die?!

312
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,360
Repel!

313
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,000
This can't be! Are these
guys really rookies?!

314
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,020
Has Admiral Kizaru arrived yet?!

315
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,100
No, sir! But I think he'll be here shortly!

316
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,400
Reinforcements from the navy
post have arrived, though!

317
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,070
H-Hold on! What's going on?! Help me!

318
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,060
Yeesh. There's a lot more than I expected...

319
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,270
You guys sure got weird powers!

320
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,250
I'd say yours is the weirdest.

321
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,980
Really?

322
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,420
What?! Swords are flying toward him?!

323
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,980
Amazing! Marines are flying through
the air, whirling, twirling...

324
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,610
There are guns and even cannons
flying! What's going on?!

325
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,040
I don't believe my eyes!
And I don't even have eyes!

326
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,800
I didn't know Kid-san and Law-san had powers!

327
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,890
It's getting interesting now!

328
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,010
On the next episode of One Piece!

329
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,350
"Break Through the Siege! The
Navy vs. the Three Captains"

330
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
