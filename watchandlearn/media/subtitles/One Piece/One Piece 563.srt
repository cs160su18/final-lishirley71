00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,530

Since the day that the dream began

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:07,270
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,460
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,860
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,290
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,170
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:53,290
The Straw Hats find themselves caught up in
the turmoil and involved in an all-out war.

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,040
Straw Hat!

81
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,590
You wanna stop the Noah, don't
you? Then you have to beat me.

82
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,900
Otherwise, you can't save
the Fish-Man Island!

83
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,350
Hordy, what's with you?!

84
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,690
You even abandoned the ones you grew
up with in the Fish-Man District!

85
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,740
Don't you realize what you are doing?!

86
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:36,310
Or is your hatred for humans so
deep that makes you lose your mind?

87
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,640
What happened to you?

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,050
Did humans beat you?!

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,470
Did humans kill your loved
ones or someone dear to you?!

90
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,610
What did you go through in the past?!

91
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,270
Answer me, Hordy!

92
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,110
What did humans do to you?!

93
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,280
This is the Air Tank. We met you a while ago.

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
Oh, it's you guys.

95
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,460
We've been listening to  what's
been going on out there.

96
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,060
And we see the Noah falling
towards the island.

97
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,800
We're getting ready as planned.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Enough with the difficult
stuff and just do it!

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,390
Luffy-san, please save the island!

100
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,310
Hey, Straw Hat. Can you hear me?

101
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,830
Listen carefully.

102
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,360
About Hordy Jones...

103
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,160
I found out who he really is!

104
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,180
That bastard!

105
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:28,200
"A Shocking Fact! The
True Identity of Hordy!"

106
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,210
Before the Noah started to fall...

107
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,230
Ouch!

108
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,530
Damn you!

109
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,410
Now I'm mad!

110
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,670
Just you wait and see!

111
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,630
Intimidation Mega Monk!

112
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,010
He was very big already!

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,080
Is that necessary?

114
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,520
How is this? Are you surprised?

115
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,870
I'm a tiger blowfish Fish-Man. Scared?

116
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,710
Not at all. Anyway, why
are you talking so fast?

117
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,790
Because I'm gonna deflate if I don't.

118
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,090
The Kraken is bigger than you.

119
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,290
What?!

120
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,840
Then, how's this?!

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,930
Blowfish!

122
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,180
--So annoying!
--I don't wanna get crushed!

123
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,890
--Help me!
--Hey, Wadatsumi-san, no!

124
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,430
You're squashing the people on your side!

125
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,600
Still smaller than the Kraken.

126
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,830
What?! Then, how's this?!

127
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,820
That's enough!

128
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,980
Your Majesty!

129
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,690
Are you all right?!

130
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,340
I'm sorry that we couldn't protect you!

131
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,340
We are such useless vassals!

132
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,260
That is okay. More importantly,
did you see the Noah?

133
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,380
Yes.

134
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,220
I can't believe it's moving.

135
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,750
Damn Decken! If the Noah had crashed
into the Princess and the island,

136
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,020
everything would have been destroyed-jamon!

137
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,950
We didn't know what was going on. We tried
to order an evacuation to all citizens

138
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,120
but I guess all the communications centers
were seized by the New Fish-Man Pirates!

139
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,700
We have been trying to reach the
border guards out at sea but...

140
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,070
Ring, ring, ring...

141
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,870
--Get ready to shoot the bubble now!
--Hurry up!

142
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,840
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

143
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,170
Why aren't they picking up?

144
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,150
In any case, take the King somewhere safe!

145
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,320
No.

146
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm going to wait for the Princes.

147
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,480
What the...

148
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,860
Tell me what is going on, guys!

149
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,950
Why are there so many pirates?!

150
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,700
Well...

151
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,920
The Straw Hats!

152
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,380
Jimbei!

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,130
Princess-sama?!

154
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,310
Hordy! Decken!

155
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,440
So that is what happened...

156
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,110
All right! I understand everything now!

157
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,820
All soldiers! Go to the plaza!

158
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,700
Follow Jimbei and the Straw Hats!

159
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,360
If they can handle the strong ones for
us, the rest are just average fighters.

160
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,960
The pirates who we mistrusted and falsely
charged are fighting for our country.

161
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,290
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

162
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,470
The least we can do is
offer them our support!

163
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,720
Yes, sir!

164
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,590
It's Neptune's army!

165
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,230
--We can handle them!
--Kill them all!

166
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,560
It's time to show our strength!

167
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,640
He's a human!

168
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,480
Go slaves!

169
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,700
Fight for us if you don't wanna die!

170
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,770
Advance, "Slave Tank"!

171
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,830
Go that way!

172
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,180
Oops!

173
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,730
You are good for nothing! Just drag him!

174
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,760
How weak!

175
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,350
Somebody, take his place!

176
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,870
How terrible.

177
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,860
That is like...

178
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,700
Nico Robin.

179
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,860
Do you think you can free those human slaves?

180
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,990
Are you sure it's wise?

181
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm sure they're holding a grudge
against the Fish-Man Island.

182
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,570
If those human pirates come against
me, I will just beat them up.

183
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,590
But they can hardly be
called "humans" now anyway.

184
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,890
I can't stand watching Hordy and the
others copying the Celestial Dragons.

185
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,810
All right! I'll do it!

186
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,380
Thanks.

187
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,480
Hey! You guys are too slow!

188
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,490
Dammit! Son of a bitch!

189
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,460
The cuffs came off!

190
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,040
Hey, what are you doing?!

191
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,630
Who uncuffed the slaves?!

192
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,920
You're a member of the
Straw Hats, aren't you?

193
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,300
Hey, turn around already!

194
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,960
What's wrong, you slaves!

195
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,810
The cuffs...

196
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,810
--Did you do it?
--Why did you save us?

197
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,440
I can't turn down a request
from a handsome man.

198
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,650
You can thank Boss Jimbei for that.

199
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,050
Jimbei asked you to?

200
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,360
You can't just do that!

201
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,600
Trawl Net!

202
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,520
I got you!

203
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,920
Cuerpo Fleurs!

204
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,860
How did you get behind me?!

205
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,590
Wh-What the...

206
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,070
It won't take long. Relax.

207
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,310
Let go of me! Who are you?!

208
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,890
You! How are there two of you?!

209
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,150
Double Clutch!

210
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,820
--Hammond-san!
--That bitch!

211
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,790
--Thank you, Sis!
--You bastards really treated us like shit!

212
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,420
You guys can't beat us on earth!

213
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,170
The human slaves are...

214
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,880
...rising in revolt!

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,100
Ring, ring, ring... Ring,
ring, ring... Clank!

216
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,270
This is one of the border guards.
Is this the Minister of the Left?

217
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,300
Yes, I is. I have been trying to
reach you - why didn't you pick up?

218
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,780
Forgive me! But I have no
time to go into detail now!

219
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,240
Please warn the whole kingdom!

220
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
The giant ship, Noah, has just lost its power

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,360
and is starting to fall
towards the island again!

222
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,840
What?!

223
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,340
The Noah is falling again?

224
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,300
Where are you now?

225
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,260
At the Air Tank control tower.

226
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,930
That's good. Then, you need to
warn everybody about the crisis.

227
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,950
None of the communication centers
on the island are working.

228
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,380
I know you can reach the
state-operated Transponder Snails

229
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,790
all over the country from there!

230
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,650
Hurry up!

231
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,820
Yes, sir!

232
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,300
To all citizens of the kingdom--
from the Air Tank above the island.

233
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,860
An emergency evacuation
order has been issued!

234
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,500
The giant ship - Noah is
falling onto the island again!

235
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Please leave the island immediately!

236
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,380
The giant ship - Noah is
falling onto the island again!

237
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,990
Please leave the island immediately!

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,680
What?!

239
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,860
CORAL HILL

240
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,860
Look!

241
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,780
It's the shadow of the Noah!

242
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,080
WATERWHEEL TOWN

243
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,080
Decken did it?

244
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,580
That's what I heard.

245
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,960
That damn stalker! I can't
believe he threw it!

246
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,790
The bubble's gonna break!

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,750
FISHVERLY HILLS

248
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,960
The island will be destroyed!

249
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,860
Hurry up! Forget about your suitcase!

250
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,080
B-But...

251
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,280
Get out to the sea!

252
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,220
Everybody, escape from the island!

253
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,220
CORAL APARTMENT

254
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,540
I heard Princess Shirahoshi was drawing
the ship away from the island.

255
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,680
Yeah, we can't just run and
leave her alone like that!

256
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,320
But the Noah is falling onto the island!

257
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,280
Well...

258
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,370
You wanna just stay here and have
Princess-sama's effort wasted?!

259
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,190
--We've got to leave the island!
--To the sea!

260
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,210
Hurry up, everyone!

261
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,770
No! That thing is gonna come back?!

262
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,090
Are we gonna be alright, Luffy?!

263
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,550
What happened to Princess Shirahoshi?

264
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,660
Decken, again?! That crazy pirate!

265
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,260
We have to run, too! It's too dangerous!

266
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,370
Leave Hordy and the others up to us.

267
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,730
All you spectators leave here
and get off of the island!

268
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,780
What are you doing? Hurry up!

269
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,030
No!

270
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,500
Wh-What?

271
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,750
Especially women and children. Go now!

272
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,210
No!

273
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:52,020
The Straw Hats are human pirates but
they're fighting for the island!

274
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,260
We can't just run out on them!

275
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,750
He's right! We were the ones
who asked them for help!

276
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,460
I can't do anything but I
want to share their fate!

277
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,730
--Me too!
--Me too, Minister of the Right!

278
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,400
Be quiet!

279
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,700
Listen, here is your duty!

280
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,660
You have to make sure to tell all
the other spectators what I said!

281
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,090
Understood?

282
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,510
I'm sure everyone has their
own reasoning and ideas.

283
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,090
If you want to stay here, suit yourself!

284
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,130
Bring it on, outlaws!

285
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,390
Straw Hat Luffy-san.

286
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,270
This is the Air Tank. We met you a while ago.

287
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,860
Straw Hat? What are they broadcasting?

288
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,740
We've been listening to  what's
been going on out there.

289
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,700
And we see the Noah falling
towards the island.

290
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,040
Luffy-sama! What should I do about the Noah?

291
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,610
What are they doing?!

292
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,660
They are broadcasting their conversation
across the country by mistake!

293
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,670
Hey, hello? How can we get air from you?

294
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:20,110
If we make a bubble and shoot
all the air from the Air Tank,

295
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,490
maybe we can surround the Noah.

296
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,510
Shirahoshi! Straw Hat!

297
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,360
I'm afraid you'll have to take it from there!

298
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,980
Enough with the difficult
stuff and just do it!

299
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,440
It's Luffy! I'm glad to hear him!

300
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
He sounds all right!

301
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,680
Well, I wasn't worrying
much since it's Luffy!

302
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,510
What are they talking about? I
heard Princess-sama's voice too!

303
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,750
--Straw Hat is the serial kidnapper, isn't he?
--He's a human.

304
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,170
Luffy-san, please save the island!

305
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:03,090
Why is the border guard
counting on the human pirate?

306
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,560
--Is the human trying...
--...To handle the Noah?

307
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,810
Hey, Straw Hat.

308
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,690
Can you hear me?

309
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,240
Prince Fukaboshi!

310
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,340
About Hordy Jones...

311
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,040
I found out who he really is!

312
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,680
Brother-hoshi, so who is Hordy?!

313
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
Hordy is...

314
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,650
…a monster who was brought
to life by our environment!

315
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,030
Our environment?

316
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,950
What does he mean?

317
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,330
The New Fish-Man Pirates are a group of

318
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,710
monsters created from an ancient grudge!

319
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,630
The grudge was born from their ancestors

320
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,630
in the shadow of the Fish-Man Island.

321
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,140
And they fear that the
grudge will be forgotten

322
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,060
and their anger against the
humans will be dispelled.

323
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,890
That's why they are so impatient.

324
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,520
And they want humans to be evil

325
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,320
so they can justify themselves
for their crusade!

326
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,700
They just want to see bloodshed

327
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,870
and they don't even want
peace for the Fish-Men!

328
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,070
What did you go through in the past?!

329
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,550
Answer me, Hordy!

330
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,220
What did humans do to you?!

331
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,480
Nothing.

332
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,360
Did you just say "Nothing"?!

333
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:35,200
We were chosen by heaven to punish humans...

334
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,290
...and granted powers!

335
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,440
I see!

336
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,030
Now I see everything!

337
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,390
Their hatred is...

338
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,610
...not rooted in their
experience or true beliefs.

339
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,110
They have no substance!

340
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,800
They are completely "empty"!

341
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,650
Hordy has become consumed by
his deep hatred of humans.

342
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,470
His dangerous emotions...

343
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,840
...are directly fueling his assault on Luffy.

344
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,700
The only thing that can help Luffy in his
desperate struggle on the airless Noah...

345
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,160
...is air from the Air Tank.

346
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,790
All hope is placed...

347
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,400
...in a single last-ditch shot!

348
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

349
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,690
"Back to Zero! Earnest Wishes for Luffy!"

350
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,690
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
