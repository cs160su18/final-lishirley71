00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,310
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

78
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,730
Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hats
returned to Sabaody Archipelago.

79
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,450
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

80
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,240
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level...

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,530
...only to be attacked

82
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,540
by the New Fish-Man Pirates
out of  the blue and

83
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,790
become separated again.

84
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,540
Luffy and the others were rescued by

85
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,130
Mermaids and were brought to Camie's house.

86
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,430
Sanji-chan!

87
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,970
We don't have time! Anyone?!

88
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,930
Somebody please! I beg you!

89
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,850
Give blood to Sanji!

90
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:22,820
"The Fish-Man Island Will Be Annihilated?!
Sharley's Prophecy!"

91
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,490
Please! Spare him some blood!
My friend is dying!

92
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,290
Someone with blood type S RH negative?!

93
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,580
We don't have time! Donate your blood!

94
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,460
We beg you!

95
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm sorry, Sanji-chin.

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,640
It's very hard for humans to get a
blood transfusion on this island.

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,600
But Luffy-chin and the others will...!

98
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,280
Damn! I've been looking so hard but I
can't find anybody who'll give blood!

99
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,530
I'm not gonna give up!
There must be somebody!

100
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,950
Sanji...

101
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,700
Human!

102
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,880
Luffy! I found a human here!

103
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,470
That barrel drifted here along
with Camie's friends. What's in it?

104
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,510
Liquor? Treasure?

105
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,730
I don't know. It's very tightly-sealed.

106
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,980
What do you think? Should
we open it secretly?

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,730
Is it okay to do that?

108
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,360
I think so.

109
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,070
Oh? You're well-prepared, Ishilly!

110
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,340
Sanji! Are you awake?

111
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,090
Sanji-chin!

112
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,010
Where am I?

113
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,010
What a relief!

114
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,260
We're in a town at the harbor.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,680
Sanji-chin, you lost almost
all the blood from your body.

116
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm so glad that we found the blood donor!

117
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh, blood...

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,450
What's wrong with me?

119
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,280
Don't get up so fast! You need to rest more.

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,200
But why won't the Fish-Men donate blood?

121
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,040
We looked everywhere in the
town but we couldn't find a human.

122
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,630
I almost gave up!

123
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,340
Guys, thank you for doing that.

124
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,430
But I don't remember anything.

125
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,970
Where was I and what was I doing?
I can barely remember...

126
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,850
No, don't think back!

127
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,100
We don't want you to have a nosebleed again!

128
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,160
Oh yeah, Sanji! Let me introduce you

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
to the blood donor that
we finally found at a bar!

130
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,150
You have to say "thank you"!

131
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,750
Huh? Don't tell me that I got
blood from such a delicate lady!

132
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,800
It's okay! We're both humans.

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,380
We have to help each other
when we're in trouble.

134
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,350
It's okay, silly!

135
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,510
If you want...

136
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,230
...We can give you more, silly!

137
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,570
I'm glad that he's back to his old self!

138
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,950
Hey, say "thank you" to them!

139
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,290
Luffy, let me see your right arm.

140
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,420
Positive reaction for poison!

141
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,550
That's a poisonous wound as I thought!

142
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,220
Come to think of it, when I
fought against the Fish-Men...

143
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,640
I felt something sting me.

144
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,730
But you're okay?

145
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,520
Uh-huh.

146
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,190
Okay, let me see it.

147
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,400
This must be deadly poison.
Are you really okay?

148
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,900
Uh-huh.

149
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,030
I can't believe it!

150
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:36,740
An antibody must have developed
in your body to counter such poison.

151
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,700
Have you ever been poisoned before?

152
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,160
Poison, huh?

153
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,810
I almost died from
poisoning in the Impel Down.

154
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,010
Almost died? It's not funny!

155
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,880
I think it was that guy!

156
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,490
The swordsman with octopus tentacles.

157
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,010
He blocked my punch!

158
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,500
I bet he's very strong!

159
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,520
That's coming from the cove.

160
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,980
Those Mermaids are really noisy.

161
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,950
Now what should I do?

162
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,710
These guys are all messed-up.

163
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,630
And I accidentally poisoned Straw Hat.

164
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,710
I'll be in trouble if he dies.

165
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,840
Ishilly and the others were screaming!

166
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,600
Ishilly!

167
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,850
Ishilly!

168
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,060
I heard them around here!

169
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,980
Where did they go?

170
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,440
I heard them talking about opening a barrel.

171
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,650
Everyone, come here.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

172
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,170
The owner of the Mermaid
Cafe who let Sanji stay...

173
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,640
What is this?

174
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,330
...Madam Sharley.

175
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,580
Oh yeah? Thanks!

176
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,380
Is the blond boy okay now?

177
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,260
THE OWNER OF THE MERMAID CAFE MADAM SHARLEY

178
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,260
Uh-huh. But since you're
such a beautiful lady,

179
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,220
it's best you stay away from the room.

180
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,070
And let's not tell Sanji-chin
that this place is in the

181
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,150
back of the Mermaid Cafe.

182
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,700
Why's that?

183
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,520
His doctor, Chopper-chin said that if
he finds out, there'll be trouble again.

184
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,280
What a strange prognosis.

185
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,400
Hey, Big Mermaid!

186
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,030
It's Madam Sharley, Luffy-chin!

187
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,700
--What's this?
--It's beautiful!

188
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,030
Don't touch it, Straw Hat boys.

189
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,870
That's the crystal ball she
uses to look into the future.

190
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,360
Madam's pre-vision is
famous in the Coral Hill.

191
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,340
I'm not practicing anymore.

192
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,640
It's better not knowing the future.

193
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,970
Well, how about this? Do you Mermaids poop?

194
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,150
What does that have to
do with her pre-vision?

195
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,320
Don't you have any class?

196
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,530
A-Apologize to her, Luffy-chin!

197
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,030
Sorry.

198
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,080
Camie, you can take a day off today.

199
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,330
Show them around the island.

200
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,080
Huh? Really?

201
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,890
You always work hard.

202
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,000
And...

203
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,560
...these days we don't
have human pirate guests

204
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,600
and my business is drying up.

205
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,540
The girls from the cove will come soon

206
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,640
so we have enough hands (hitode).

207
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,890
Enough starfish (hitode)...

208
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,440
Oh no! I should have delivered
those clams to Pappagu by now!

209
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,440
That was so out-of-context!

210
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,190
He must be hungry...

211
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,120
What? Monsieur Pappagu is having
fun at the cafe with his old friend.

212
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,370
At the cafe?

213
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,790
Old friend?

214
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,650
I couldn't mention this in front of her,

215
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,570
but when Madam was a little child,

216
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,680
she said that many pirates
would come to the island.

217
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,720
That was the year before
the Great Pirate Era began.

218
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,210
What?!

219
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,170
Among a host of other things,

220
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,800
she recently predicted the war at Marineford

221
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,230
and Whitebeard's death.

222
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,590
What?!

223
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,650
She can't stand knowing
what bad things will happen.

224
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,360
Must be scary!

225
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,700
Where's Chopper?

226
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,620
Oh, he's taking care of Sanji.

227
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,400
--Luffy-chin! Usopp-chin!
--Yeah!

228
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,590
This is the main street of Coral Hill.

229
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,210
Look! That's the entrance
of the Mermaid Cafe.

230
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,390
Oh, I'm getting hungry!

231
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,970
It's a cafe!

232
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,520
We have food too! Cakes and sea fruit.

233
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,100
What about meat?

234
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,900
We Merfolk don't eat meat and fish

235
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,780
so what we have is; Wakame Brûlée,
Mozuku Tart, Kelp Soufflé...

236
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,030
Are they edible?

237
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,910
--Oh, we have meat too!
--What?

238
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,790
Shellfish meat! Scallop
Sandwich, Freshwater Clam Pizza...

239
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,710
That's not meat!
Don't ruin meat's reputation!

240
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,040
Whoa... Anyway, let's
go in! The Mermaid Cafe!

241
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,460
Yeah, Pappagu will be there.

242
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,710
Hey, don't ruin meat's reputation!

243
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,720
Thank you very much!

244
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,390
Resting my bones! Resting my bones!

245
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm happy for you, Bone!

246
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,240
--Brook!
--Brook-chin!

247
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Oh, Luffy-san and Usopp-san!
And it's been a while, Camie-san!

248
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,670
Could I look at your panties...

249
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,000
She's a Mermaid!

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Straw! Nose!

251
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,760
I missed you guys!
I didn't know that you were here!

252
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,260
Long time no see!

253
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,930
So you were with Pappagu!

254
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,850
Yes, I didn't expect to be
rescued by Pappagu-san!

255
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,400
I was so lucky!

256
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,610
Yeah, that was just as surprising to me!

257
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,070
While I was polishing off an
idea for a new design at the cove,

258
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,820
I saw some bones drifting
towards me rolling along.

259
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,200
Those are bones!

260
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,870
Soul King, come to see us again!

261
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,210
I had a wonderful time!

262
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll be back, beautiful Mermaids!

263
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,010
What?!

264
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,010
I'm going boneless!

265
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,430
Oh, I can't exist without bones!

266
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,020
Oh, I don't care if I die now!

267
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,650
Oh no, I'm already dead!

268
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,940
How cool!

269
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,940
He got so hyper in the cafe...

270
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,240
Yeah, I wonder what's going on inside.

271
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,990
Wait, wait, wait!

272
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,370
You aren't leaving today, are you?

273
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,490
I know you are interested in the cafe

274
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,820
but you can come back with everybody later.

275
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,000
I was gonna take Bone to my house now.

276
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,380
Come with me! Do you like sea monster meat?

277
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,240
Do you have meat?!

278
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,560
I'm wild, I don't wanna eat
seaweed or shellfish!

279
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,850
What I mainly eat is violent sea monsters!

280
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,560
Oh, Pappagu, I almost forget!
Here are your clams for today.

281
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,620
Yeah! Camie's best clams!

282
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,570
So you eat shellfish!

283
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,030
Damn!

284
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,410
Lovely Mermaid...

285
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,080
Yes?

286
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,090
Fantastic Mermaid...

287
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,290
Are you alright?

288
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,430
--Beautiful! Elegant! Wonderful! Sniff, sniff!
--I wonder how they're doing...

289
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,230
Unlike Merfolk, Fish-Men eat meat and fish.

290
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,350
It's not like we don't have them here.

291
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,440
Oh, glad to hear that!

292
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,360
Oh, just what I was looking for! Hey, taxi!

293
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,650
Here I go!

294
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,530
What?!

295
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,450
Vander Decken! He's a ghost -
Why are they looking for him?!

296
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,670
Oh, this guy was on the
ghost ship that we saw?

297
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,880
--What?! Did you guys see him?
--Yes.

298
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,160
The whole nation has been
looking for him for years!

299
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,950
He's a pirate--an undersea bandit!

300
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,550
I'll tell you about it later. Get on first!

301
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,610
Vander Decken was sending love letters...

302
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,360
...to the Mermaid Princess of the
Ryugu Kingdom at least once a week.

303
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,620
Before long, the letters became
packages, then threats to marry him...

304
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,210
Oh, it's fluffy! Feels good!

305
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,420
Yeah, it's like heaven!

306
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,540
Listen to a starfish!

307
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,590
--Okay!
--Oh, sorry.

308
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,050
His eccentric behavior made
the Mermaid Princess afraid

309
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,850
and it became a national concern...

310
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,980
Yeah, the Mermaid Princess'
father - King Neptune got mad

311
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,610
and those 3 princes that we just met

312
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,610
have been looking for him with the army

313
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,250
but they can't find him.

314
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,450
Camie, Camie... I was just
telling them about it...

315
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,740
King Neptune, the God of the Sea,
who runs this country...

316
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,870
...has 4 children including
the Mermaid Princess.

317
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,840
The Mermaid Princess is the youngest
and the 3 princes are older than her.

318
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,000
Hey, Camie...

319
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,170
But what I can't understand is

320
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:45,180
Vander Deck must be a ghostly
pirate from hundreds of years ago...

321
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,520
Well, those legends are often exaggerated.

322
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,180
He truly existed and in fact,

323
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,870
I heard that the legendary
captain--Vander Decken...

324
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,580
...reached the Fish-Man Island and died here.

325
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:07,660
The ship that you saw was the
Flying Dutchman, wasn't it?

326
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,120
It's his descendent who is on the ship!

327
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,090
Vander Decken IX!

328
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,510
What?! His descendent?!

329
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,490
Oh, is that so?

330
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,580
That means he's not a ghost.

331
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,670
I thought that it was a real ghost and felt

332
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,320
more dead than alive since I'm a skeleton.

333
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,730
That's good. That's just good.

334
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,480
Camie... Camie... Camie...

335
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,320
When I look closer,
Merfolk and Fish-Men are all different.

336
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,280
There are old Mermaids! Like Grandma Kokoro!

337
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Look, there's a baby!

338
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,330
The father is a Fish-Man and the
children are Merfolk and Fish-Men.

339
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,670
When a Mermaid and a Fish-Man get married,

340
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,420
their kids would be either Merfolk
or Fish-Man, either boy or girl.

341
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,630
So there are 4 possibilities.

342
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,370
Hmmm, that's why they're all different.

343
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,760
Interesting!

344
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,060
Alright, let's get on the highway!

345
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,400
It's fast!

346
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,830
What's that?

347
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,110
That's a candy factory.

348
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,990
No, why is there a pirate flag?!

349
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,570
That? You can see the same flag at the

350
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,170
entrance of the island and at the harbor.

351
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,750
That flag is protecting
the Fish-Man Island.

352
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,960
The mark belongs to a pirate called
Charlotte Linlin of the New World.

353
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,670
Also known as Big Mam,
one of The Four Emperors!

354
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,510
Th-The Four Emperors?

355
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,810
Before the war, Whitebeard was
protecting the island from pirates

356
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,060
but now it's Big Mam.

357
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,940
Hmmm.

358
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,650
But she demands a lot of sweet
candies every month in exchange.

359
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,110
That's what the factory is for.

360
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,070
Candies?

361
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,620
This country can't exist without the
protection of those powerful people.

362
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,000
That's how dangerous this place is,
where pirates come and go frequently.

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,720
But she's protecting the country
after old man Whitebeard.

364
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,540
Isn't Big Mam a good person?

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,240
It's hard to say.

366
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,330
Whitebeard never demanded anything.

367
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,180
So Big Mam views it as business, maybe.

368
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,090
Big Mam...

369
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,100
One of The Four Emperors like Shanks.

370
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,180
Wonder if I'll meet her someday.

371
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,160
Look forward!

372
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,100
We're in Fishverly Hills,
the town of the celebs!

373
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,570
That tall building right in
front of us is Pappagu's house.

374
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,530
That?! That's too much for a starfish!

375
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,770
We have to do something!

376
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,230
She's a madam from the Mermaid Cafe.

377
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,710
What's the matter, Madam Sharley?
Why are you so upset?

378
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,010
We have to do something before it's too late!

379
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,430
Hey, Madam! What's wrong?

380
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,140
Look for him!

381
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,560
The pirate boy with a straw hat!

382
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,650
And throw him out of this country!

383
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,860
Is it a pre-vision again?

384
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,130
I wasn't planning on using it.

385
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,700
But I felt something about him

386
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,420
so I couldn't help looking into the future!

387
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,370
What's wrong?! What did you see?!

388
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,830
Madam!

389
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,000
Sharley! Say it!

390
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,210
--Madam!
--Madam!

391
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,630
I hope it won't happen!
I hope it'll be proven wrong!

392
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,670
A human with a straw hat on...

393
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,410
At Straw Hat Luffy's
hands...  at his hands...

394
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,950
the Fish-Man Island will be...

395
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,960
...destroyed!!

396
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,040
Fish-Man Island shines with beauty.

397
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,630
But history has created a darkness

398
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,930
Hating humans, they desire retribution.

399
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,800
Their plans are mobilizing beneath the surface.

400
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,720
Meanwhile, Luffy and his crew run amok at Pappagu's shop,

401
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,600
and the king of Fish-Man Island, Neptune himself descends from his palace.

402
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

403
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,750
"The King of the Fish-Man Island!
Neptune, the God of the Sea!"

404
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
