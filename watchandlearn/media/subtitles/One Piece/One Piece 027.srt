00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,690
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,080
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,910
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,650
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,140
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,550
Please, leave the ship, Sanji-san.

25
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,540
I don't want to kill you.

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,150
No way!

27
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,110
Pearl... Cymbals!

28
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,350
I took everything away
from that damn geezer...

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,320
So that I could live...

30
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,420
His power...

31
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,960
His dream...

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,200
This restaurant is that geezer's treasure!

33
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,550
I... I can't repay the damn
geezer for his kindness

34
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,600
unless I risk my life for him, too!

35
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,560
Gum-Gum...

36
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,810
Stop it! Keep your hands off of them!

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,060
...Battle-Axe!!

38
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,810
"Coolheaded, Coldhearted Demon;
Pirate Fleet Chief Commander Ghin"

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,270
The fin's been smashed!!

40
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,270
How dare that brat do such a thing?

41
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,230
Is he trying to destroy the ship?!

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,740
Ghin! Blow Zeff's brain out!

43
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,000
Do it already!

44
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,620
B-But he saved our lives
by giving us 100 meals!

45
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,430
Ghin, you son of a bitch!

46
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,220
Hey!

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,920
I didn't really attack
you guys or anything...

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
...I only broke the fin.

49
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,370
Hey, chore boy!
What do you think you're doing?!

50
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,020
I'll sink it.

51
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,100
What?!

52
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,070
I'll sink this ship.

53
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,870
That ain't funny!

54
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,150
I was wondering how you'd explain that...
Are you crazy, you damn bastard?!

55
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,320
If I destroy the ship,
there'll be no reason for them to attack.

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,780
What?!

57
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,390
What do you know?
What do you know about

58
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,630
the significance of
the kindness I received?

59
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,280
What do you know
about this restaurant?!

60
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,120
So you're gonna die for the restaurant?
Are you stupid or something?

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,210
What'd you say?!

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,670
Dying isn't...

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,100
Dying isn't something you
should do to repay kindness!!

64
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,360
That's not what he saved you for!

65
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,080
Being given life and yet dying...
is something that a weakling would do!

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,020
Then is there any other way
to settle this matter?!

67
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,120
Now, now, you guys... Stop fighting.

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,380
It's simply disgraceful for you to fight
among yourselves after all this.

69
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,440
You can't do any more reckless things
while the hostage is with us anyway.

70
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,650
It was unfortunate for you guys to have
the Krieg Pirates as your opponent.

71
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,680
Burn to death with my Fire Pearls!

72
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,490
Huh?

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,760
Ghin! Why...

74
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,300
Ghin-san?

75
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,650
Sorry, Pearl. Out of my way...

76
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,850
Ghin! Are you going to betray us?!

77
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,350
I'm sorry, Don Krieg.
He saved our lives.

78
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,560
I don't want him to die this way.
At least... At least...

79
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,940
...please let me bury him with my hands.

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,310
Have you lost your mind,
Pirate Fleet Chief Battle Commander?

81
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,650
Are you all right, Owner?

82
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,800
Owner! Please hang in there!

83
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,490
Chief Battle Commander?

84
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,990
Then he wasn't an underling?

85
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,290
To think that he cracked the
shield guy's shield... How powerful...

86
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,000
See? It worked great...
my plan to lure him out...

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,780
Liar! You really were going to
break the ship, weren't you?!

88
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,240
Sanji-san!

89
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,760
What?!

90
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,250
I wanted you to leave this ship unhurt,

91
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,350
but it looks like that's not gonna happen.

92
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,350
You got that right.

93
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,110
I can't let you have this restaurant
even if it means risking my life.

94
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,290
Then, at least burying you
with my own hands is...

95
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,090
...my way of settling this matter.

96
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,390
Hmph! Thanks. To hell with you!

97
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,960
You too, Straw Hat.

98
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,490
Well... I won't lose
against weaklings like you.

99
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,640
You bastard!

100
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,180
What did you just say
to our Chief Commander?!

101
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,650
"To hell with you"? "Weaklings"?
How dare you run your mouth like that!

102
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,090
We're the Krieg Pirates,
the strongest pirates in the East Blue!

103
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,300
Wasn't it just because you had
the biggest number of pirates?

104
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, boy... You struck at
the heart of the matter...

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,750
So I was right...

106
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,550
You son of a bitch!!

107
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,090
I'm gonna kill you!!

108
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,700
Stop mocking us!!

109
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,150
Back off!!

110
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,980
Don Krieg!

111
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,320
But...

112
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,130
If you get upset when called weak,
that just proves that you are weak.

113
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,150
The result will decide
if you're strong or weak.

114
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,590
You've got me. Don't get so worked up!

115
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,820
Y-Yes, sir!

116
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,930
Ghin!

117
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,780
Finishing off that cook
is your responsibility.

118
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,740
I'll take care of that
naive idiot over there...

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,740
Understood, Don Krieg.

120
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,890
Hey, brat!

121
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,650
Hm?

122
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,260
I'll make you fully experience the true
power that conquered the East Blue.

123
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,980
I'll teach you that your devil fruit
or whatever it is means nothing.

124
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,090
All your griping's getting annoying....

125
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,640
I'll kick your ass. It's as simple as that.

126
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,870
I'm coming over now.
You just wait there!

127
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,310
What impudence...

128
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,000
This is it for that cook.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,460
That's right.

130
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,490
When Ghin-san holds that weapon
in his hands, it means he's serious.

131
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,570
His nickname is... Demon...

132
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,970
It doesn't matter if his enemy
is crying or screaming,

133
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,100
he tortures him to death mercilessly.

134
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,630
He's a demon who doesn't
have a shred of sympathy...

135
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,070
I'm sorry, Sanji-san,
but you can't defeat me.

136
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,080
Just keep saying that, you small fry.

137
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,580
Here I come!

138
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,600
You son of a...

139
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,140
Sanji!

140
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,220
I warned you...
that you can't defeat me...

141
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,340
See you...

142
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,020
Just accept your defeat!

143
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,380
Yeah! Our Chief Commander
is really incredible!

144
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,300
Crush him, Ghin-san!

145
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:15,960
Sanji!

146
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,260
Sanji! Come on!!

147
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,310
Die!

148
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,310
That cook landed a blow on Ghin-san...

149
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,870
Don't tell me Ghin-san
is gonna be defeated, too...

150
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,670
You fools...

151
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,800
What have you seen with
your own eyes all this time?

152
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,360
Ghin is a coolheaded demon
whom I put my trust in.

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,800
That's exactly why I appointed
him as the Chief Commander.

154
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,870
He'll show his true colors soon.

155
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,180
Is Sanji really okay?

156
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,700
Of course he isn't! Combining
the attacks from that shield guy,

157
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,820
he must have at least 5-6 broken ribs.

158
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,650
Those skewered dumplings...
aren't as good... as I thought.

159
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,370
Is that the best
the Chief Commander can do?

160
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,480
Hm? What's he doing? Is this any
time to be paying attention to others?

161
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,840
Ah-ha!

162
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,920
All right! I'll kick his ass
while I have an opening!

163
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,670
Hm?

164
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,030
Don't overexert yourself.

165
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,610
Huh?

166
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,410
You bastard!!
Do you really intend to fight me?!

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,610
Intend to fight you?
I don't need to do such a thing.

168
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,920
What's needed is
a means to kill. That's all.

169
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,430
And that's the force that humans have.
Remember it, you damn monkey!

170
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,730
What?! If you take a monkey
lightly, it'll scratch you!

171
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,420
Sanji!

172
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,980
All right! His bones
are shattered by now!

173
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,610
Get him!

174
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,820
Dammit! If only he hadn't taken
the damage from the shield guy...

175
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,430
He's taken at least 10 hits
of those iron balls by now...

176
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,560
You really do whatever
you want... you small fry!

177
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,040
Damn... He's really strong...

178
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,130
I'll finish you off now!

179
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't struggle any more...

180
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,700
What was that?! Pity?

181
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,580
Don't underestimate me!

182
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,300
Ah! Ghin-san!

183
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,140
Sanji!

184
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,140
Ah! Sanji!

185
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,530
Oh, no! He can no longer bear even
the shock from his own attacks...

186
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,920
All right!

187
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,540
That's our Ghin-san!

188
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,850
You... damn... bastard...

189
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,850
I can't...

190
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,570
I can't... Don Krieg...

191
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,590
Huh?

192
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,930
I can't...

193
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,350
I can't do it, Don Krieg!!

194
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,720
Ghin...

195
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,960
I can't... kill this man...

196
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,900
What'd you say?!

197
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,780
It was... it was the first time for me...

198
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,760
Even when I'm down and out,
I won't take charity from others.

199
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,290
Take this food away now!

200
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,330
Stop whining and eat it already!

201
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,810
To me, anyone who's
hungry is a customer.

202
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,000
Sorry, but I'm not a customer.

203
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,510
I can understand how a hungry
person feels more than anyone.

204
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,540
You can die for your pride if you want,

205
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,440
but if you eat and survive,
don't you think there's a future for you?

206
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,310
Sorry...

207
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,790
Sorry... Thank you... I thought
I'd die. I thought I was done...

208
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,410
Delicious... Delicious...
I've never eaten food so delicious.

209
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,350
It's damn delicious, isn't it?

210
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,640
Sorry... You're gonna get yelled at,
because you fed me free, right?

211
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,650
There's no proof, so there's no
reason for me to be yelled at.

212
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,510
No one had treated me
so kindly before...

213
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,000
So I can't... kill this man!

214
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,290
Come back any time!

215
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,870
I know... I don't intend to betray you.

216
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,120
I don't think what we've done up until
now is wrong or anything, either...

217
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,590
I still respect your power
and I appreciate you as well.

218
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,240
I was really happy when you
put your trust in my strength

219
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,930
and appointed me as
the Chief Commander.

220
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,590
So I've followed your orders
and I will from here on as well...

221
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,940
But... But...

222
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,670
I can't kill... just this one person!

223
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,200
Don Krieg... If circumstances
allow... is there any way...

224
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,080
is there any way you'd let this ship...
this restaurant off the hook...

225
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,930
You son of a bitch!

226
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,340
As if defying my orders wasn't enough,

227
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,680
now you're giving me a lecture?!
What's the meaning of this craziness?!

228
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,310
How disappointing...

229
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,940
Morality... Sympathy...
I hate those kinds of things the most.

230
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,830
Didn't I always say that?!

231
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,690
Move away, guys...

232
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,170
Don! That's...

233
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,810
M... MH5!

234
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,090
That's the strongest poison gas weapon!

235
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,880
What?!

236
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,840
Poison gas?!

237
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,790
Ahh! Mask!

238
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,660
Put the mask on!

239
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,300
Hurry up!

240
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,290
We'll be killed, too!

241
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,600
To use a weapon like that...

242
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,990
That's despicable, you bastard!

243
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,300
Do you know what's gonna
happen when you use that?!

244
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:23,260
Stop whining about stupid stuff,
you fools! This is a battle!

245
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,270
Winning is the only goal.

246
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,280
Foul play? Dirty?
What's wrong with that?!

247
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,390
Might makes right.

248
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,670
No matter what means we take,
the result is everything.

249
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,360
Using poison gas or whatever...
Winning is all that matters.

250
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,890
That's power.

251
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,580
What a horrible bastard...

252
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,290
Throw that gas mask away!

253
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,430
You're no longer one of us.

254
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,000
Die!

255
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,410
I won't let you shoot poison gas!

256
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,380
Stop scampering about, anchor boy!

257
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,620
D-Dammit!

258
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,620
Ghin! You don't have to listen
to what that weakling says!

259
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,630
I'm gonna kick his ass now!

260
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Don't mock Don Krieg!

261
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,770
He's the strongest man.
You can't defeat him.

262
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,360
Come to your senses, you idiot!
That man is trying to kill you!

263
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,780
I deserve it...

264
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,540
...since I couldn't fulfill my role,
shamelessly losing to emotion...

265
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,770
This is... This is a
well-deserved punishment!

266
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,380
Ghin!

267
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,870
Why... Why?

268
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,630
Ha! So you showed your pride
at the end... But it's too late.

269
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,070
Die together with that cook!

270
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,560
Deadly Poison Gas Bomb... M... H... 5!

271
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,450
Dive into the sea!!

272
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,910
Owner! Get inside the restaurant!!

273
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,670
Let me borrow those.

274
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,680
Sanji! Ghin! Use these!

275
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,740
Chore boy!

276
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,130
Now for mine!

277
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,580
Ahh! Everyone dived into the sea!

278
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,340
Oh, boy... Oh, boy... Oh, boy...

279
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

280
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

281
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

282
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

283
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

284
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

285
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,870
so that my memories won't fade

286
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,220
I'll show you whose
graveyard this place is!

287
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,150
You can't stop my ambition
with a silly weapon!

288
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,650
How come you don't flinch?!

289
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,260
You don't know?
Are you stupid or what?

290
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,150
What'd you say? Say that again!

291
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,320
Are you stupid or what?

292
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,650
Don't repeat it!

293
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,490
You're the one who told me to say
that again. How selfish you are...

294
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

295
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,500
"I Won't Die!
Fierce Battle, Luffy vs. Krieg!"

296
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
