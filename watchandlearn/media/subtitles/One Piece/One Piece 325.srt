00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,980
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,760
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,230
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,400
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,510
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,810
Live as you please, Luffy.

35
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,110
In the flow of time, as a result of
various circumstances and strong spirits,

36
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,670
people come to question the world they live in!

37
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,530
The day we meet will come at some point.

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,370
The judicial island Enies Lobby is the front door

39
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,170
that leads to the World Government,
a huge organization.

40
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,750
Now that they've caused it to fall,

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,630
neither the Navy nor pirates
will leave them alone.

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,930
You can say that the Straw Hats
are now known all around the world.

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,510
And so is this wanted poster.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,880
Sanji! You're the best!

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,020
Isn't this incredible?!
It's the spitting image of him!

46
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,790
He pulled one crazy stunt!

47
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,370
Hey, look! It's an article on Straw Hat!

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,190
Looks like he toppled the Tower of Justice.

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,900
His bounty is going to skyrocket after that!

50
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,260
Enies Lobby is famous
for Water Seven's sea train.

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,640
It isn't that far from here...

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
This must be a twist of fate.

53
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,870
For them to be within range...
What a pitiable, unfortunate crew.

54
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,150
Let's go, Captain!

55
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,270
Of course we're going!

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,870
Come on! Get ready to set sail!

57
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,400
We're about to get busy!

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,330
Hey!

59
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,610
Hold it, Teach!

60
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,950
I've been looking for you.

61
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,970
What?

62
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,960
Go back three days before the
world was shocked and amazed

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,140
by the Straw Hat Pirates' wanted posters.

64
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,930
There was an event that
occurred on a certain island.

65
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,150
This is Banaro Island on the Grand Line.

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,740
"The Most Heinous Power!
Blackbeard's Darkness Attacks Ace"

67
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Oh, Ace! Commander!

68
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,910
Don't call me "Commander" after all this time.

69
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,220
That word is meant to be
reserved for people you respect.

70
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,380
Don't mock me.

71
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,450
Oh, so you must be "Fire Fist" Ace.

72
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,810
Yeah, that's me. Nice to meet you!

73
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,440
I see... you've already become
a great captain in your own right.

74
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,390
Isn't that right, Captain Marshall D. Teach
of the Blackbeard Pirates?

75
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,410
Jeez, Ace! I haven't seen you in ages!

76
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,700
So what's the deal?
How'd you know I was here?

77
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,540
Teach, let's cut the idle talk!

78
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,970
You should know the rules, having lived
through twice as much as others.

79
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,510
Isn't that right?

80
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,460
Yeah, I get it.

81
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,090
But let me say something first!

82
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,900
What do you say, Ace?
Why don't you join my crew?

83
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,380
Seize the world with me!

84
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,990
I've already planned out how
I'm going to rise up in power!

85
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,000
Whitebeard's reign is over!
I'll become the next Pirate King!

86
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,330
For starters, I'm gonna kill
Straw Hat Luffy, who is in Water Seven,

87
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,910
as a gift to the Government!

88
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,340
Luffy? What did you just say?

89
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,330
Oh! You know him?!

90
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,990
Another reason I can't let you go free!

91
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,350
He's my brother!

92
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,280
What?

93
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,690
And naturally, there is no way I'm going to...

94
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,820
...join your crew.

95
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,700
Damn!

96
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,540
One of your men could use a lesson in manners!

97
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,670
Fire Gun!

98
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,640
Flame Commandment!

99
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,800
Fire Pillar!

100
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,730
Auger, Burgess! Keep outta this!

101
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,120
You don't stand a chance
against that man. Stay back!

102
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,150
--Sorry!
--Fire Fist!

103
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,390
--Captain!
--Aw, that burns!

104
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,740
Captain!

105
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,960
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

106
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,490
I'm burning!

107
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,390
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

108
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,490
Wow, hot, hot!

109
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,110
Captain!

110
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,450
Damn it! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

111
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,500
Shut up, men! Give me some space!

112
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,820
I get it, Ace. You're burning
to kill me, aren't you?

113
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,790
It's no surprise. Murdering a
crewmate is a grievous crime.

114
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,140
It's true that I killed the
4th division commander Thatch!

115
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,600
I didn't have a choice! He got his hands on
the Devil Fruit that I had my sights set on!

116
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,280
The ship's rule dictated that whoever
found the fruit could eat it, remember?

117
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,980
I memorized what every fruit
in the book looked like,

118
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,820
so I knew it was the one I'd been
looking for the second I saw it!

119
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,290
The only reason I spent all those
decades on Whitebeard's ship

120
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,950
was because I figured that was
the most likely place to find it!

121
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,910
I woulda given up if fortune
hadn't smiled down on me,

122
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,510
but that fruit fell into my friend's hands!

123
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,250
So then you killed Thatch and stole it?

124
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,720
Well, that's how the ball bounces.

125
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,140
This ability chose me, Ace!

126
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,690
It has made me the most
powerful person out there, Ace!

127
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,500
Look! It's rare, even for a Logia type.

128
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,950
Ace, isn't your body made out of fire?

129
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,620
Mine is darkness!

130
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,880
Look! It's the same black smoke from earlier.

131
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,260
Those pirates are still in town.

132
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,120
They're still going at it?
If they destroy any more of our village...!

133
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,050
Keep away from them!
Our only option is to run!

134
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,440
Darkness...?

135
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,750
That's right, Commander Ace. You can't kill me.

136
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,120
It's said that this is the most
evil power in Devil Fruit history.

137
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,650
It's the Logia Devil Fruit, Dark-Dark Fruit.

138
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,520
I've become a man made of darkness.

139
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,840
I'll give you a taste of just how powerful it is!

140
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,510
Go ahead and try.

141
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,960
What are you doing?! Hurry!

142
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,440
The captain is about to cut loose!

143
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,540
If we don't hurry away from here,
we'll get caught in the attack!

144
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,980
Stand right back up!

145
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,720
The darkness gushing from his body
is crawling across the ground!

146
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,580
Creepy! It's pitch black, almost like
there is a hole in the ground.

147
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,480
It's scary how it feels like it could absorb you.

148
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,450
Hurry and get away!
Get as far away as you can!

149
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,190
Go through the forest!
Run all the way to the beach!

150
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,060
Darkness is gravity!
It has the power to pull everything in!

151
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,290
Not even a ray of light can
escape from its infinite gravity!

152
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,800
But you're up against me...
and I'm still untouched.

153
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,730
I'm not going after you just yet.

154
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,850
You can stay there and
enjoy the view of the town.

155
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,760
Black Hole!

156
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,700
The ground is devouring the town!

157
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,750
Why? Wh-What's going on?

158
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,270
Dark gravity uses its limitless power
to condense objects and crush them!

159
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,530
Is this a nightmare? Our village is...

160
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,340
And now I'll show you what
happened to the missing village.

161
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,220
Behold the shambled mess it has become!

162
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,150
Liberation!

163
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,530
Our village... has been reduced to rubble...

164
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,640
Now do you get it, Ace?

165
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,350
This is the power I've obtained!

166
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,720
Firefly!

167
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,060
Fiery Doll!

168
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,340
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

169
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,520
That burns!

170
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,950
--I fully understand how great
the power of darkness is.
--Hot, hot, hot, hot!

171
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,720
But here's what puzzles me...

172
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,530
--If it's a Logia, these attacks
should go right through you.
--Dang, this is hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

173
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,700
I already told you:
Darkness draws everything in,

174
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,510
including bullets, swords,
punches, fire, and lightning!

175
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,850
Unlike the rest of you, I don't get the
option of letting stuff pass through me!

176
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,440
My body feels far worse pain than the
average person in every way possible!

177
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,650
But in exchange for accepting that risk,
there is one other thing...

178
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,170
...that I am able to absorb.

179
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,640
Vortex!

180
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,930
To be exact, dark gravity has the ability

181
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,100
to draw in a Devil Fruit
power holder's physical body.

182
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,900
Gravity?!

183
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,510
And my body...

184
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,440
Well? Have you figured it out, Ace?

185
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,900
It couldn't be...!

186
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,970
I bet it's been a while since someone's
landed a punch on you, eh, Ace?

187
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,110
I think that you got it when I grabbed you!

188
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,880
Another thing that my darkness drags in is...

189
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,920
...Devil Fruit powers!

190
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,480
That means that while I'm touching them,

191
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,010
Devil Fruit power holders
can't use any of their powers!

192
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,060
Logia, Zoan, and Paramythia!

193
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,560
Against a world of Devil Fruit power holders
who are overconfident in their abilities,

194
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,620
I've obtained a means of attack
that cannot be defended against!

195
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,630
So I just can't let you catch me, right?

196
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,240
I already proved that you can't
escape from my dark gravity!

197
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,010
Vortex!

198
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,270
St. Elmo's Fire!

199
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,680
Take this!

200
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,290
Damn it! The fire lances...!

201
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,290
He messed up some vertebrae!

202
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,160
His new power is a pain...!

203
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,110
Cross Fire!

204
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,600
Banana Rock...! It's collapsing!

205
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,980
What's going on? They can't be humans!

206
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,000
Forget the village! What is going
to happen... to our whole island?!

207
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,780
I had assumed that Devil Fruit power holders
were so preoccupied with their powers

208
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,040
that they would be pushovers
once they lost them.

209
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,740
But I should have expected one
of Whitebeard's commanders

210
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,270
to be a fearsome fighter
in basic combat as well.

211
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:21,400
Now then, today brings us
to another crossroad of fates.

212
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,680
Everything is rendered
powerless before darkness!

213
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,260
Even someone as powerful as you.

214
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,470
But this makes me want
your power all the more.

215
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,450
Ace, join my crew!

216
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,050
If I yield to power, there's no
point in being born a man.

217
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,850
I'll never leave anything to
be regretted later in my life!

218
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,030
Do you understand, stupid?

219
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,970
How long can you live like that in this world?

220
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a pity, Ace!

221
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
Die in darkness!

222
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,050
Flame Commandment...

223
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,520
Flame Emperor!

224
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,450
The sun or the darkness--
there'll be only one winner!

225
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,490
I'm gonna make Whitebeard the king!

226
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,250
The "Decisive Battle of Banaro Island"
on the Grand Line...

227
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,320
The fight between these two pirates...

228
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,110
...will be described as the trigger for a
massive incident that is soon to take place.

229
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,630
We're hitting the sea of adventure!

230
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,550
Head straight for Fishman Island!

231
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,180
No, no, no, no! With the New World nearby,
we should exercise caution!

232
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,770
Oh, Sanji! There's a ship.

233
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,440
It's missing both a sail and an ensign.

234
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,890
We're sailing full-speed
toward trouble already?!

235
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

236
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,940
"The Mysterious Band of Pirates!
Sunny and the Dangerous Trap"

237
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,320
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
