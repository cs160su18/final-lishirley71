00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,860
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,790
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,220
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,450
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,180
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,110
Now, what're you gonna do?

35
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,230
Take me to the shore already
so that I can knock you out!

36
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,690
You don't have to tell me!
I'll shut you up right here, right now!

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,200
Super Cartwheel, Iron Ball!

38
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,410
I'll slam you into the corner of
the tower using this momentum!

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,630
I see. It indeed looks like
I'll get smashed into pieces.

40
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,840
Franky Centaur!

41
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,340
--Chapa!
--I've got both your legs!

42
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,550
Now you can't move around at will in the air!

43
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,100
So what?! Even if you do that,
you can't stop this momentum!

44
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,310
That's not totally true.

45
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,700
70 mm 0.2 Cola Cannon!
A bit of Coup de Vent!

46
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,490
Ahh! The momentum has died down!

47
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,450
The rotation stopped! Damn you!

48
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,500
But this is enough!
We're already above the shore!

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,450
Now, take this!

50
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,550
70 mm 1.5 Max Cola Power!

51
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,990
Coup de...

52
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,530
What're you doing?!

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,760
Give up already, you bastard!

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,860
Coup de...

55
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,560
...Vent!

56
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,460
Super!

57
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,780
Yoyoi!

58
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,710
That voice... Don't tell me
he broke the fridge door...

59
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,180
I... I... I... I...

60
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,160
I... I... I... I... I...

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,310
I had a feast!

62
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,490
He got a little fatter!

63
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,950
Just how much stuff in that fridge did you eat?!

64
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,080
--Hm?
--That's...

65
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,140
Snap!

66
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,490
Listen, Sogeking. Don't lose your posture.

67
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,340
You are a sword!

68
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,810
Someone get me a lawyer! I'll sue you for sure!

69
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,240
Suit yourself.

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,940
I'm gonna try this out first, okay?

71
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,570
What? What?

72
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,330
Ahh! This is a dream! This is a dream!

73
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,780
Morning, come already!

74
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,970
Those guys sure do some weird stuff.

75
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,340
This is interesting!

76
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,970
Oni...

77
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,870
Hey! Wait! Hey! Are you really gonna do it?!

78
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,060
You're the demon here!

79
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,130
...Giri!

80
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,180
Ow, ow, ow... Stars are coming out of my eyes.

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,980
Just don't move!

82
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,100
Tiger....

83
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,050
Huh? Tiger? Tiger?
I'm in trouble! I'm in trouble!

84
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,320
Dammit!

85
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,410
That hit me good. Stars are
coming out of my nose, too.

86
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,640
I said don't move!

87
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,880
Don't be unreasonable!
Are you trying to kill me?!

88
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,140
Are they idiots?

89
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,500
Are they going to fight us seriously?

90
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,210
After all, it seems like we have no
choice but to play rock-paper-scissors.

91
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,000
And I'll cut off the hand of the loser.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,140
Wait! Like I said, don't you
have any better ideas?!

93
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,550
No, I don't.

94
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,160
You don't have to be so blunt!

95
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,220
This is no time for stupid arguments.

96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,060
Just give it up, nose.

97
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,980
"Just give it up, nose"?

98
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,530
Chopper! Please hurry up!

99
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,980
"Uncontrollable! Chopper's Forbidden Rumble"

100
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,660
Yoyoi!

101
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,940
Yoyoi!

102
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,700
I've never seen anyone with
so little self-discipline as him.

103
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,100
To think that he gained weight in the
few minutes I took my eyes off of him...

104
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:53,300
You don't... need to be...
need to be... need to be...

105
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,030
I'm not concerned! Just speak normally!

106
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,410
That's "need to be concerned," right?!

107
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,660
Well...

108
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,870
Thank you!

109
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,530
That's exactly what I was... I was... I was...

110
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,590
I got it, so you can cut that out!

111
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,960
Anyway, there's no need
to be concerned, then?

112
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,410
Come back here!

113
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,260
I was... I was... That's right!

114
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,430
As for why...

115
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,580
...just look! Life Return!

116
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,980
Wh-What the heck?!

117
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,750
Digest!

118
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,200
Absorb!

119
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,660
Now, I'm back to normal!

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,290
Ahhh! What?! What are you?!

121
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,770
What did you just do?!

122
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,410
Do it again.

123
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,730
If you wish...

124
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,640
Life Return!

125
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,630
Digest!

126
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,930
Absorb!

127
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,470
Amazing! One more time!

128
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,930
O-One more time?

129
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,190
Life Return!

130
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,950
Digest!

131
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,720
Absorb!

132
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,910
You're amazing! How does that work?!

133
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,330
Glad you asked!

134
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,330
A thousand years at sea, and a
thousand years in the mountains...

135
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,090
Breathing in the wind and drinking dewdrops,

136
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,160
I trained myself, living as a hermit!

137
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,470
After all that, I've... I've... I've...
I've acquired this "Life Return"!

138
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,050
Essentially, if you extend
your consciousness everywhere,

139
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,910
from your hair to your internal organs,
toes, even the tip of your downy hair,

140
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,940
there's no part of your body
that you can't manipulate.

141
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Extending your consciousness
even to the tip of your hair?

142
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,340
I've read about that kind
of ability in a book before.

143
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,340
It's called something like biofeedback...

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,040
Then your hair moves around like
an octopus because of that ability?!

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,880
Yoyoyoi! An octopus?! How terribly rude!

146
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,970
Call me... a valiant...

147
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,020
...lion... will... will you?!

148
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,360
Why does it matter which one?

149
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,190
Life Return!

150
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,970
Hair Bind!

151
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,660
Yoyoi!

152
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,040
Yoyoyoi!

153
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,290
Dammit!

154
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,930
If I get caught by that, it'll be all over for me!

155
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,890
Shave!

156
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,930
Where did he go?!

157
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,970
Finger Pistol! Q!

158
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,570
When that stick doesn't
even have a pointed tip...

159
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,160
Q! Q! Q!

160
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,780
Heavy Gong!

161
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,580
Iron Body!

162
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,270
Yoi!

163
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,840
Ow, ow, ow...

164
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,590
What's the matter?!

165
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,840
Dammit!

166
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,390
As I thought, he won't budge unless
I attack with Arm Point or Horn Point.

167
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,350
But rumble balls are potent drugs.

168
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,630
One in six hours is a proper dosage.

169
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,340
If I take more than that,
it'll be a huge strain on my body.

170
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,050
On top of that... the second one will
alter the transformation wavelength,

171
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,980
and so it'll be hard to
control my transformations.

172
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,490
With the third one, I'll lose consciousness
and hardly be able to fight.

173
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,170
What do I do? I can take just
one more and get strengthened.

174
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,490
I'll roast you on a skewer!

175
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,260
Shishi Kabob!

176
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,230
Yoi! Yoi!

177
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,730
Yoi!

178
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,920
If I don't do anything, I'm just wasting time!

179
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,050
Rumble!

180
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,490
This is high-risk, but it'll give me a chance!

181
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,490
--Yoyoi!
--This is all or nothing!

182
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,500
I'll somehow settle this within three minutes!

183
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,710
Take this! Horn Point!

184
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,420
--What?!
--Yoyoi!

185
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,290
Wrong one!

186
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,510
Ow, ow, ow...!

187
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,380
Kabob!

188
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,050
Jumping Point!

189
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,990
Ah! Wrong one!

190
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,650
Yoyoi! Yoyoi!

191
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,950
As I was afraid, I can't control
my transformations. Dammit!

192
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,340
If only I could somehow use Arm Point,

193
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,020
I could give him a cloven
attack with all my might!

194
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,830
This room is dangerous with the fire spreading.

195
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,740
This is no time for me to be stuck
with a guy with no key on him!

196
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,410
I'd better hurry up and get the #2 key...

197
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,600
...and free Zoro and Sogeking!

198
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,320
Or we can't rescue Robin!

199
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,090
That's right... Robin...

200
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,610
That's right! I'm...

201
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,570
I'm...

202
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,530
I'm fighting in order to save our friend!

203
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,240
What a tough animal!

204
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,210
Life Return!

205
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,050
His hair changed into the shape of hands!

206
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,760
I have to do it! I can't be
defeated in a place like this!

207
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,380
I'm their only hope!

208
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,390
Shishi Finger Pistol!

209
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,880
Yoyoi!

210
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:33,740
Showing mercy is never... part of a lion's fury!

211
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,890
Ouch...

212
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,580
Taking the second rumble ball is like gambling.

213
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,380
There are seven transformations in total.

214
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,210
In other words, the probability of
getting Arm Point is one in seven.

215
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,220
If I could get it, I could hammer
my strongest attack into him.

216
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,890
That's my only chance!

217
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,090
Arm Point!

218
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,520
Shishi Kabob!

219
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,150
For my friends... Arm Point!

220
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,910
Yoyoi!

221
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,490
Arm Point!

222
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,870
Yoyoi!

223
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,770
Wrong one!

224
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,800
Wrong one! Why doesn't it come out?!

225
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,800
My body is at the end of its rope.
I somehow have to get Arm Point out!

226
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,920
Yoyoi!

227
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,470
Hm?

228
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,180
--Yoyoi!
--Whoa!

229
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,600
It's out! I didn't notice it!

230
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,310
Be prepared!

231
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,730
I'll put everything I have
into this... into this attack!

232
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,210
Cloven...

233
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,360
Shishi Finger Pistol!

234
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,500
If I back off now, I won't get another chance!

235
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,530
Cloven...

236
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,200
Iron Body! Strength!

237
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,570
...Roseo Metel!

238
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,350
Go down!

239
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,800
That was my best attack!

240
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,800
Ahh...

241
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,970
Ahh... Splendid...!

242
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:37,160
It was indeed a beautiful blizzard of...
cherry blossom petals.

243
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,160
I can't...

244
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,620
I can't...

245
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,580
Did I do it?

246
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,470
I can't bear it anymore!

247
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,670
I will give you hell! Yoyoyoi yoi!

248
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,560
Tempest Kick! Lotus!

249
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,590
This is it... I no longer have
energy left to fight back.

250
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,070
Chopper!

251
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,790
Chopper, what in the world did you do?

252
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,710
I don't remember.

253
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,530
"I don't remember" doesn't cut it.

254
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,570
It was good that no one died, at least.

255
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,900
Even while you were sleeping,

256
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,230
the entire country was making
a big fuss about that night.

257
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,150
How are we going to settle that?

258
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,060
So I did something that terrible?

259
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,800
You almost destroyed an entire village.

260
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,950
It's fine that you love experiments,
just like your old man did,

261
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,030
but for something like that, you have
to do it only after thorough planning.

262
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,950
Thorough planning...

263
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,560
You were not doing it for
fun at all. I know that much.

264
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,250
But that's exactly why you
need to be even more careful.

265
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,200
Doctors are always
entrusted with people's lives.

266
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,320
Small mistakes can become irreversible.

267
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,500
We're always walking on
the edge of a cliff like that.

268
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,040
If you can't even imagine what kind of result

269
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:43,280
careless actions can cause, then you
should give up on becoming a doctor.

270
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,470
Seriously, you inherited
everything from that quack,

271
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,790
including his predisposition for causing a fuss.

272
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,470
The world always has its
troublesome seeds, huh?

273
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,210
I'm sorry, Doctorine.

274
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,880
I won't do it again.

275
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,270
I'll never do it again,
so please don't kick me out.

276
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,770
You're such a fool. Hurry up and get better.

277
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,320
Or I can't even go out shopping.

278
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,000
Life Return!

279
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,030
Hair Bind!

280
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,520
Don't cry. Don't cry.

281
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,570
If you do, it'll be a disgrace to your manhood.

282
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,170
He's gonna kill me...

283
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:47,090
This isn't an evening in a mountain
village where you can hear the cicadas.

284
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:54,690
This is a journey to hell
that you knew could come.

285
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,900
The leaves I broke off of a willow tree
branch to give to you as a parting gift,

286
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,860
hoping for your return someday,
are colored crimson!

287
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,590
Take it! Now, now, now, now!

288
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,330
Crimson... Song of Willow!

289
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,910
I'm gonna die...

290
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,750
Robin... That's right. I can't give up!

291
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,110
He slipped away from my Hair Bind!

292
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,340
Rumble...

293
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm sorry, Doctorine.

294
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,190
Just like Doctor put his life on the
line in order to save the country...

295
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,110
...I want to put my life on the
line in order to save my friend.

296
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,950
If I'm gonna die anyway, I'll do it!

297
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,250
Just please, nobody come into this room.

298
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,210
I used three Rumble Balls.

299
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,170
Then I lost consciousness and after that...

300
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,980
You could say that your Devil Fruit
powers went out of control.

301
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,140
Don't ever go down that path, okay?

302
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:21,110
It's an excessive power that destroys
foes, friends, and even your own body.

303
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,680
What you turned into was just like a real...

304
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,290
...monster.

305
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,850
Boss! Big news! Big news! Big news!

306
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,630
Oh, what's the big news today, Usopp?

307
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,970
We're going to appear again after a long while!

308
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,590
And that Buggy guy and his men will go
wild noisily, messily, tiredly, disorderly...

309
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,770
Now, now, now... Why don't you
eat and calm yourself down? Here.

310
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,430
Okay. Ahh! Anyway, this is big news, Boss!

311
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,870
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,210
"Boss Luffy Returns! Is it a Dream
or Reality? Lottery Ruckus!"

313
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,610
I'm gonna be a policeman!!
