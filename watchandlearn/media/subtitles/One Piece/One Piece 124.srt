00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,680
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,980
How is it from the sky, Pell?!

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,260
I searched every corner of the rooftops
of the buildings near the Square,

21
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,940
but I saw no preparations
for the cannon anywhere.

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,830
Then... it might be from
somewhere inside a building...

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,550
I'll search all of them!

24
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:17,900
Okay!

25
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,650
I don't feel any anger against you...
You know why, Nico Robin?

26
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,790
How silly... We were a team for four years.

27
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,600
I knew you'd pull something like this.

28
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,800
Water?!

29
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,840
If you get wet, a knife
can stick in you, right?!

30
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,370
He dodged it! Where'd he...

31
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,290
I'll forgive you for everything, Nico Robin...

32
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,360
...because I've never... trusted
anyone... from the beginning.

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,400
That's right... That place can...

34
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,290
Special Attack... Red Serpent Star!

35
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,510
"The Nightmare Draws Near! This is
the Sand Sand Clan's Secret Base"

36
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,840
Crocodile!!

37
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,570
Where are you?!

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,240
What's with this place?

39
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,810
It's falling apart!

40
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,150
There's no mistake!

41
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,220
The cannoneer must be in there!
I finally figured it out!

42
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,050
Is he really in such a place, Vivi?!

43
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,240
If this dust devil is part of the plan...

44
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,710
...it should be a place where
they can still hit the target...

45
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,210
And it also has to be an open space
where a large cannon can fit

46
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,150
and yet can't be seen from the sky.

47
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,430
Look! This place is
unexpectedly large, isn't it?

48
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,680
Why don't we make this
place our secret base?

49
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,830
Yeah!

50
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,690
There's nowhere else I can think of!

51
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,470
Okay! Hold on! Everyone's headed here.
So we'll leave a message...

52
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,860
I'm gonna go on ahead, Usopp-san!

53
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,300
What?! W-Wait, Vivi! W-Wait!

54
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,800
Hurry!

55
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,250
Ah, okay.

56
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,160
All right! The princess! We found her!

57
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,330
She led us right to her!

58
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,100
There're still some members
of Baroque Works...!

59
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,550
Urk! We signaled the enemy, too!

60
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,580
That's Usopp's signal.

61
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,440
But why is the palace that far?

62
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,000
Good, it's close!

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,490
I wonder if they found the cannoneer.

64
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,520
They must have! Hurry!

65
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,070
Usopp...! Noise...!

66
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,180
So this is... this is the...

67
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,710
Now! Let's go, Vivi!

68
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,620
Okay!

69
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,290
Th-They ran away!

70
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,170
Stop!

71
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,000
It took so long... to make it this far...

72
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,890
But the end... has finally come...

73
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,090
This land is mine!

74
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,780
You...!

75
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,010
I've cornered you, gator!

76
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,570
Why are you alive?

77
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,990
No matter how many times I kill you,
why do you stand up to me?!

78
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,430
Well?! Straw Hat!

79
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,160
How... did he survive and come here...?

80
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,460
Who on earth is he...?

81
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,110
Straw Hat...

82
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,260
Just how many times
do you want to be killed?

83
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,000
You still haven't returned...
what you took away...

84
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,510
What I took away...?

85
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,970
Is it money...? Fame...?

86
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,070
Trust...?

87
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,850
Lives...?

88
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,850
Rain...?!

89
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,940
What do you want me to return?

90
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,660
There're so many things that I took away.

91
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,520
The country!

92
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,810
The country? You say funny things...

93
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,180
I'm just about to take this country...
by becoming its king.

94
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,870
When we got to this island,
it was already gone.

95
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,900
Her country was gone...!

96
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,990
I'm going to persuade the Rebel Army

97
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,930
because I want no more shedding of blood!

98
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,900
Up until just recently, it was
a thriving city full of greenery!

99
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,580
Please, Vivi-chan! Stop those fools!

100
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,870
If this is really her country...

101
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,680
What's wrong... with not
wanting people to die?!

102
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,850
Just one look at this kingdom
and even I can tell...

103
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,090
...what most needs to be done!

104
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,190
As if putting your single life
on the line is enough!

105
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,950
I don't have...!

106
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,190
I don't have anything else
that I can put on the line...

107
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,970
At least try putting all of our
lives on the line together!

108
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,670
Aren't we friends?!

109
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,310
If this is really her country...
she should be... smiling more!

110
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,310
Even if you talk cool, when you don't
have water with you, what can you...

111
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,150
This can't be... Kicking me without water...

112
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,820
If only you hadn't come to this country...
Alabasta would've remained peaceful!

113
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,690
Isn't it just heartrending?

114
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,230
Love for the kingdom will be
what destroys the kingdom.

115
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,980
Crocodile!

116
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,530
Wai...

117
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,770
Could it be... you're using...

118
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,410
...your blood...?!

119
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,410
Sand can be hardened
by blood, too, can't it?

120
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,440
From Rainbase... to the palace...
and to the underground mortuary temple...

121
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,660
I'll reward you for your
persistence in challenging me,

122
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,100
even after living through hell twice...

123
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,700
You bastard...!

124
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,070
...as a pirate...

125
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,260
It seems that you want to
beat me up no matter what.

126
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,420
And I'll also admit that you're
an annoying enemy to me.

127
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,110
It came off! What the...

128
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,170
It's a poisonous hook.

129
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,500
I see...

130
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,460
As a competent enough pirate,
you seem to understand

131
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,810
that a duel between pirates
is always a fight for survival,

132
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,190
and that there's no such
thing as "playing dirty."

133
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,750
When the explosion happens up there,

134
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,980
this place will probably
collapse in one breath as well.

135
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,740
This is the last time.
Let's settle it once and for all!

136
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,840
The smoke was in that direction, right?

137
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,880
No, was it this way?

138
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,900
What?! Marines?!

139
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,850
Look! It's Roronoa Zoro!

140
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,250
Dammit! I didn't realize that
the Navy showed up in this town...

141
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,840
When I don't have time...

142
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,840
I guess I can't help it.
I'll settle this in three seconds.

143
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,470
You...! Why are you in a place like this?!

144
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,790
What the heck are you doing?!

145
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,960
That's what I'd say!

146
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,340
Roronoa Zoro!

147
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,280
We knew you weren't good with directions,
but this is worse than we expected!

148
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,250
Go back! If you go north at the last
corner, you can get to the Square!

149
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,770
Go back and turn right! Not this way!

150
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,010
Are you stupid?!

151
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,190
Stupid?!

152
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,010
Hurry up!

153
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,670
Go!

154
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,680
Wh-What?! What's going on?!

155
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,380
Run! Run, Vivi!

156
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,330
Usopp-san! I can't...

157
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,130
Wait! Hold it!

158
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,850
Th-Tha... Thank...

159
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,620
We'll assist you!

160
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,050
Please stop the explosion
of the Square. Now, hurry!

161
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,690
Thank you! Hurry, Usopp-san!

162
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,020
Ah... Yeah!

163
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,110
All units! Continue to assist them...!
With all your strength!

164
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,030
Yes, ma'am!

165
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,740
Me, go to Alubarna?

166
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,430
We're chasing after the
Straw Hat pirates, right? Or...

167
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,160
You decide what to do when you're there.

168
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
You just follow your sense of justice.

169
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,220
Whatever happens, I'll accept responsibility.

170
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,760
Hurry! Hurry!

171
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,860
We wasted quite a bit of time!

172
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,360
I don't know why they did,

173
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,460
but if the Navy hadn't helped,
it would've been worse!

174
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,660
Idiot! Don't look aside!

175
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,660
If the attack isn't stopped,
the casualties will be a lot worse!

176
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,140
Right!

177
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,000
The attack can't be stopped by praying!

178
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,000
In two minutes, are we gonna
be winners or dead bodies...?

179
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,470
We still have a minute and a half!

180
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,990
Yes!

181
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,940
You've got us all!

182
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,440
Yes!

183
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,120
There they are! Vivi! Usopp!

184
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,160
Nami-san! Tony-kun!

185
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,370
What's going on?! The Navy helped us!

186
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,120
Did you find the cannoneer?!

187
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,350
We haven't confirmed it yet,
but there's no mistake!

188
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,780
I must've looked at it many times,
but it was my blind spot.

189
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,040
The cannoneer is over there without a doubt!

190
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,730
What?

191
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,440
What?!

192
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,130
The clock tower...

193
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,630
I see! From that place, he can
get a good shot at the Square!

194
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,090
If only Pell would get here,
we could stop the attack.

195
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,950
Pell...!

196
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,280
We don't have time.

197
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,040
If I'm not mistaken, the smoke
rose around here, but...

198
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,110
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit... Hey, listen.

199
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,430
I just shot down a big bird
using this ribbit-ribbit gun.

200
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,050
My blunder...

201
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,960
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

202
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,670
Who in the world is he...?

203
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,820
Crocodile treated even our kingdom's
proud warriors like worms, and yet...

204
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,520
You were skewered...
buried alive... and dried up...

205
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,720
Even you, who stood back up after all that...

206
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,360
...won't be able to survive this.

207
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,230
Game over... The poison will
pass into your system soon.

208
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,010
You don't understand anything!

209
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,900
I wonder what happened...

210
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't see Pell anywhere...

211
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,140
Say, Vivi. We can't go up that high
within a minute all by ourselves!

212
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,680
Pell! Where are you?! Hurry!

213
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,950
In any case, we should hurry up, too!

214
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,020
We have no choice but to use the stairs!

215
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,140
Where's the entrance?

216
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,230
Hey!

217
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,920
Hm?!

218
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,880
Nami-san! Vivi-chan!

219
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,530
Why are you up there?!

220
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,550
Why? You left a message
under the smoke, didn't you?!

221
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,820
It said "clock tower."
That's why I came up here.

222
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,290
What should I do? Where's the cannoneer?

223
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,290
He's at the top! Top! Go up
from there and beat him up!

224
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,360
Hm? Hm?!

225
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,830
Hey, I looked all over for you guys!

226
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,970
Zoro! You too?!

227
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,800
What're you doing there?

228
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,020
That's what I'd like to say!

229
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,850
Well, Navy guys kept saying,
"go north," "go north,"

230
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,730
so I came up here for now...

231
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,800
"North" and "up" are
totally different, you know!

232
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,360
But in any case, good job! Go up from
there and destroy the clock tower!

233
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,920
No!

234
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,460
What?

235
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,280
They can't go inside the
clock tower from where they are.

236
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,740
Other than entering from
the sky, the only way up

237
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,480
is the stairs in the back on the first floor.

238
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,810
But Zoro can destroy the tower wall and...

239
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,090
We don't know if the cannonball
can bear that kind of shock!

240
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,280
We have no choice but to
go up the stairs after all!

241
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,630
Wait, Vivi!

242
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,130
What?

243
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,570
I've got a good idea!

244
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,330
Ribbit... ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...

245
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:49,330
Hey listen, Mr. 7. I know that this is
our last mission. Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...

246
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,880
That's the plan.

247
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,210
According to the plan,
we have 30 seconds left.

248
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,880
What's that?!

249
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,290
Mr. 7! Miss Father's Day!

250
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,950
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

251
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,890
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

252
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,120
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

253
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,570
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

254
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:50,790
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

255
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,250
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

256
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,000
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

257
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,750
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

258
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,140
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

259
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,100
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

260
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,280
A never-ending journey to be together

261
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

262
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,320
Looks like more weirdoes showed up.

263
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,790
So if we take them down,
the attack will be stopped, right?

264
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,710
Hey, Nami. What're you gonna
do by stacking us up like this?

265
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,270
Just shut up and do what I say!

266
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,800
We've only got 20 seconds!

267
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,220
Sink or swim... But we have no choice...

268
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,080
We'll put it all on the line
in the time we have left!

269
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,800
On the next episode of One Piece!

270
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,170
"Magnificent Wings! My Name is Pell,
Guardian Deity of the Country"

271
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,370
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
