00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,740
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,140
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:53,290
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:00,890
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:08,810
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,970
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:25,100
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,230
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,110
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,190
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,370
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:51,960
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,440
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:04,930
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,770
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,080
I should never have come!

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,580
Get down from there!

20
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,170
Impudent Blue Sea woman! I'll chop you up!

21
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,600
Seis Fleurs!

22
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,580
Twist!

23
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,220
Just awful.

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,740
Have you ever seen a flying slash?

25
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,340
Single-Sword Style! Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,870
"The Roaring Burn Bazooka!!
Luffy vs. War Demon Wyper"

27
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,360
Damn him! He... He... killed Sanji...!

28
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,330
It's no use! His heart isn't
beating at all! Hey! Sanji!

29
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,020
Sanji! Sanji!

30
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,600
Dammit! If only Chopper were here...!

31
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,170
Wait, Usopp!

32
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,520
That's his right side!

33
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
The heart's on the left!

34
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,470
"Right Side"

35
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,100
Yikes! It's beating!

36
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,560
Thank goodness! He came back to life!

37
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,870
But he's seriously injured! He could die!

38
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,650
What?! Oh crap! This is bad!

39
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,280
Eneru...

40
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,210
There's no need to be indignant.
It's been so long since we last met.

41
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,190
Why don't you cheer up a bit, Gan Fall?

42
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,560
H-Hey! What the hell did you do to Sanji?!

43
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,360
J-Just try something else! My 8,000
subordinates won't sit by quietly!

44
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,150
H-Here. If you run away now,
I'll forgive you. What do you say?

45
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,490
He... ran...?

46
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,170
Damn you!

47
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,970
Remain silent... and I will do nothing...

48
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,580
Got that?

49
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,730
Good.

50
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,820
Who is this guy?! What did he just do?!

51
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,180
Just what are you thinking?!

52
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:59,500
Your men that I captured when we
invaded this island six years ago

53
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,170
are working very hard for me.

54
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,880
My Divine Squad...

55
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,850
They're also very strong.
Truly great talent, they are.

56
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,280
But it appears that their six years
of hard labor is nearing its end.

57
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,020
And as I'll no longer have any need
for this island once they're done,

58
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:32,310
I thought I would come to
bid you farewell. That is all.

59
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,210
However, the denizens of
Skypiea are all ignorant fools.

60
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,000
They only view this island
as a clump of Vearth, you see.

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
What do you mean?!

62
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,260
The reason we forcefully took this island away,

63
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,290
the reason the Blue Sea flies
stepped foot onto this island,

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,350
and the reason the Shandians are
intent on returning to their home

65
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,230
are not at all different.

66
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,020
In other words... there is but one
thing everyone seeks on this island!

67
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,900
It was because everyone desires
the great relics of Shandora,

68
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,530
the legendary city of gold that
prospered in the Blue Sea long ago!

69
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,680
Gold? What is that?

70
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,720
That's what I mean by ignorant!

71
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,140
No one living here knows of gold, or its value!

72
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,700
Funnily enough, this game is the final battle.

73
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,780
The winner of this survival game
will make the bountiful gold his own.

74
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,200
Can you hear it?
The sounds of the lively festival...

75
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,550
As a matter of fact, I'm a
participant myself, so I must be off.

76
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,680
Wait, Eneru! The Divine Squad...
Are you going to free them?!

77
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,640
God only knows.

78
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,440
Wait, Eneru!

79
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,760
He disappeared...

80
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,740
Usopp!

81
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,160
Thank goodness! His heart
is still beating somehow...!

82
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,180
Gum-Gum...

83
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,630
...Balloon!

84
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,620
Try all you want, it's no use!
Not even cannons or guns work on me!

85
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,360
Apparently not.

86
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,500
So I'll change the style!

87
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,580
Peeyew!

88
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,930
What's this smell?!

89
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,470
Gas is stored inside the
Breath Dial of this weapon,

90
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,650
which is called a Burn Bazooka.

91
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,660
The bluish flames that ride on the
expelled gas burn prey to a crisp!

92
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,430
What the...?! It went right
through that giant tree!

93
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,430
Huh?! He disappeared!

94
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,430
Bastard! Where is he?!

95
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,790
Gum-Gum...

96
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,060
...Pistol!

97
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,970
Gum-Gum Stamp!

98
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,870
That was close!

99
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,330
Gum-Gum...

100
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,040
...Spear!

101
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,810
If it's a bazooka you want,
you can't beat mine!

102
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,560
Straw Hat!

103
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,020
Gum-Gum...

104
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,740
Burn...

105
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,230
--...Bazooka!
--...Bazooka!

106
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,740
Straw Hat!

107
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,900
That bastard!

108
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,640
What's wrong, Straw Hat?!

109
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,730
I know you haven't kicked the bucket yet!

110
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,200
Yeah! Of course I haven't!

111
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,630
What the...?! What the...?!

112
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,220
What happened?!

113
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,690
Where did he go?

114
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,500
No matter. This is no time
to be wasting energy on him.

115
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:17,360
I need to save some strength...

116
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,210
...and make it to Eneru!

117
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:25,180
One more Reject, and my body
probably will be blown to bits.

118
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,290
I'm coming for you, Eneru!

119
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,520
How do ya like that?!

120
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,990
Damn it! We absolutely
won't let you go any further!

121
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,990
Shut up! I'm after Eneru's head!

122
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,990
Out of the way!

123
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,790
Not another one!

124
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,220
I have no business with
Divine Soldier small fries!

125
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,520
That's some rare ammunition you have there.

126
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,900
Heavy matter that doesn't
normally exist in the sky...

127
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,440
The Vearth mineral, iron?

128
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:39,160
It seems you've taken down
many of my men, Shandian.

129
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,300
You're Genbou, one of the main forces, yes?

130
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,210
Divine Commander Yama!

131
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,550
Get out of my way!

132
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,780
Damn you...

133
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,000
I-I refuse...

134
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,960
...to die in a place like this!

135
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:35,280
Oh! You're still alive. You're tough, indeed.

136
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,970
Very well. As a symbol of respect
for your determined spirit...

137
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,940
...I will finish you off with my secret technique.

138
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
10-Axe Combo!

139
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,530
Damn you, Yama!

140
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,370
Axe Mountain!

141
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,730
So close. You did well to make it this far.

142
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,920
What?! Who are you?!

143
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,960
Don't give us, "What?!"

144
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,190
We're the Deputy Divine Commanders!

145
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,000
How dare you kill our brother Satori?!

146
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,870
How dare you?!

147
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,080
What?! I don't know any brother of yours!

148
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,340
Don't play dumb! My name is Hotori!

149
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,590
My name is Kotori!

150
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,220
You guys killed our brother!

151
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,820
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about!

152
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,250
Satori was one of Eneru's four priests.

153
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,380
He guarded Illusion Forest.

154
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,190
Then, the priest Luffy
and the others beat was...

155
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,780
Yes! Their elder brother!

156
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,540
See! You do know!

157
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,500
You must pay!

158
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,500
Pierre!

159
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,300
I must take care of them
and hurry after Eneru.

160
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,180
There is no telling what he
might do to my subordinates!

161
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,050
Stand back, girl! Even with my
injuries, I will not lose to them!

162
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,280
No! Sometimes, even I...

163
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,370
...have to protect these guys!

164
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,380
Very well!

165
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,680
First, ascertain their dials!

166
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,430
Right!

167
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,920
We're going to avenge our brother!

168
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,360
It finally stopped...

169
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,780
Where am I?

170
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,920
Hey! Guys! Is anyone here? It's me!

171
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,390
If you're here, say something!

172
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,850
I guess no one's here...

173
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,290
Where?

174
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,340
Where did it go?!

175
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,450
G-Gedatsu-sama. Y-Your eyes
are rolled inside your head.

176
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,460
Y-You cannot see ahead of you like that.

177
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,800
How careless of me!

178
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,100
Have a look at this photograph.

179
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,890
Here it is. That puny creature.

180
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,980
He's with the Blue Sea people!

181
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,650
What? It isn't a raccoon dog?

182
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,420
Raccoon dog? No, it is not a wild animal.

183
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,530
It is unquestionably a
creature from the Blue Sea!

184
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,040
Luffy! Where are you?!

185
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,170
Zoro! Are you asleep again?!

186
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,340
Robin! Hurry over here!

187
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,890
Where is everyone?!

188
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,490
I'm feeling insecure!

189
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,970
Hey! Guys! It's me!

190
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
Where?!

191
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,820
Where did you go?!

192
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,630
Yikes! W-What is this?!

193
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,140
Racing full speed ahead as always

194
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,890
A to Z, we run through it

195
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,690
We all have worries and fall many times

196
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,610
But we just need to rise to the top someday

197
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:32,080
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

198
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:40,140
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

199
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,640
I never treat you "bad"

200
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,340
How many times did we fall?

201
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:55,430
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

202
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,970
Smile! Come back to you, friends

203
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,780
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

204
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,700
Come back to you, friends

205
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,540
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

206
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,240
Come back to you, friends

207
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,260
Are you a priest?!

208
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,090
This area is already my territory!
All around us are Swamp Clouds!

209
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,330
There is no escape!

210
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,260
Yeah! Everyone protects me
because I always run away!

211
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,640
That's why they don't rely on me!

212
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,770
I'm going to raise a pirate flag
right here! I'm gonna beat him!

213
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,040
On the next episode of One Piece!

214
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,950
"The Ordeal of the Swamp!
Chopper vs. Sky Punk Gedatsu!!"

215
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,090
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
