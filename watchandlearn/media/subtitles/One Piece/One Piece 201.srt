00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesometreasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be Kingof
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyonedreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seenthrough
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destinyis
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieveyour
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,610
Run! Run! Run!!

18
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,450
W-Wait up!

19
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,320
Where's the Going Merry?!

20
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,580
"Enter the Hot-Blooded Special
Forces!Battle on the Bridge!"

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,270
S-Someone...

22
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,170
Hey! There's still one here!

23
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,470
Damn, I can't believe the Straw
Hatsleft one of their crew behind!

24
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,030
N-No! I'm Major Shepherd,an
inspector from the Navy!

25
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,020
Give me a hand!

26
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,390
Inspector?

27
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,350
I have to contact HQ...

28
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,530
...and let them knowNavarone
let pirates escape...

29
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,590
You're a pathetic liar, Condoriano!

30
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,470
You may think you can
fool us,but you're wrong!

31
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,270
Take him away!

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,130
Condoriano?!

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,020
W-What is this?!

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,830
Give it up, already!

35
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,770
Let go! I am not Condoriano! I'm Shepherd!

36
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,830
Major Shepherd, an inspector from the Navy!!

37
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,080
W-What is it?!

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,320
Marines!

39
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,040
T-This way, too?!

40
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,840
This is bad! Very bad!There's
no way out of this!

41
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,470
Things are finally getting interesting!

42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,680
The old fortress guy said there'sabsolutely
no escape from this place!

43
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,570
I can believe that. There are at
least1,000 marines stationed here...

44
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,040
And just how is that interesting?

45
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,740
There's absolutely no escape!

46
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,650
Again, how is that interesting?!

47
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,020
Just forget it, Usopp.

48
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,500
Once he says something, he doesn't stop...

49
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,750
Unit 37 has arrived!

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,100
Unit 44 has arrived!

51
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,940
Capture the Straw Hat crew!

52
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,540
Gum-Gum...

53
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,010
...Gatling!

54
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,140
Don't let them escape! After them!

55
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,800
Stop, Straw Hat!

56
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,590
Those are the Straw Hats!

57
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,340
A dead-end?!

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,230
No, we can run along the cliff...

59
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,100
So you've finally shown yourself, Straw Hat?

60
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,700
The commander of Navarone!

61
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,910
Jonathan, was it?

62
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,210
Old fortress guy! What're you doing there?

63
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,090
This is my room.

64
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,840
F-Fire cannons!

65
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,360
Huh? B-But firing at the
central tower isn't--

66
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,970
I don't care! Fire!

67
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,940
L-Luffy! Luffy! Oh, yikes!

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,400
Whadya think?! I rescued my crew!

69
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,620
I told you, I'll leave when I wanna leave!

70
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,550
Indeed. So do you want to leave now?

71
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,590
Yeah! We're gonna leave now!

72
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,960
Think you can escapefrom
Navarone-- no, from me?

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,200
We won't get caught! We're pirates!

74
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,950
Run!

75
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,350
They got away!

76
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:55,620
Commander! Unit 21 is currentlyin
Block 7, ready to ambush them!

77
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,680
This is our chance to drive themthere
and take them all out at once!

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,970
Have the men withdraw from Block 7.

79
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,750
It's a dead-end there!
It's the perfect chance...

80
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,940
The Straw Hats don't play by the book.

81
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,420
Never underestimate someonewith
a 100 million-Berry bounty.

82
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,510
A proper fight would result insignificant
injuries to the soldiers.

83
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,620
There is no point in needlesscasualties
or destroying our own base.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Yes, sir!

85
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,580
They will, without fail, head forthe
dock to retrieve their ship.

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,380
Let's have a counterattack waitingfor
the seven pirates at Dock 88.

87
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,050
Stop, Straw Hats!

88
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,500
Drake.

89
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,010
Sir!

90
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,540
Rush ahead to the dock and leadthe
capture of the Straw Hats.

91
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,010
Use of the weapon is granted.

92
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, sir!

93
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,720
But won't it take time forLt.
Commander Drake to reach Dock 88?

94
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,070
Yes, that's true.

95
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,770
For them to proceed to Dock 88,they
will have to cross this bridge.

96
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,660
We simply need to defend it.

97
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,980
I suppose I'll lure them to
theStraw Gate on the upper deck...

98
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,260
However strong they may be,

99
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,930
it will take some work to breakthrough
if we fortify the Straw Gate.

100
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,680
That should buy us some time.

101
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,950
I see.

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,210
Now, then. Which unit shall I have defend it?

103
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,050
I guess it would have to be them...

104
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,100
♪ We are the Navarone Marines! ♪

105
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,600
♪ We are the Navarone Marines! ♪

106
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,110
♪ We'll show you our fiery spirit! ♪

107
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,770
♪ We'll show you our fiery spirit! ♪

108
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,310
Of course!

109
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,780
Please leave Straw Bridge to us, Unit 55!

110
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,870
We will crush the Straw Hats, without fail!

111
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,630
♪ We'll show you our fiery spirit! ♪

112
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,390
♪ We are the Navarone Marines! ♪

113
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,660
I leave it to you...

114
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,760
Umm... Excuse me...

115
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,940
What is it?

116
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,790
Did something happen?

117
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,280
Pirates have escaped!

118
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,120
Vile ones called the"Straw
Hats," with bounties!

119
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,340
Apparently, a few are stillholed
up inside the base.

120
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,550
Now what?! Luffy and the othershave
already sprung into action!

121
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,190
They're probably headed for thedock
where the Going Merry is...

122
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,330
That means Luffy rescued Zoro!

123
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,210
What're you so happy about?!

124
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,360
We don't know the fortress' layout
yet,or even have an escape plan!

125
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,870
Why couldn't they have stayed still?!

126
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,910
B-But now we have no choicebut
to go to the dock too...

127
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,510
In any case, we gotta get out of
hereand meet up with the others...

128
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,970
The problem is them...

129
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,250
Kobato-san! We know that one ofthe
pirates is disguised as a doctor!

130
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,960
You're done operating! Let us look inside!

131
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,310
Kobato-san!

132
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,930
Kobato-san! Open the door!

133
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,200
T-This is bad! Very bad!

134
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,980
You two!

135
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,260
U-Uhh, Dr. Kobato...

136
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm sorry I didn't say anything!It's
true! We're... pirates...

137
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,740
Please run! There are
piratesloose inside the base!

138
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,430
How terrifying! What's more,they're
pretending to be doctors!

139
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,430
You two could be in danger!

140
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,500
U-Uhh, well...

141
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,890
The truth is, those pirates... They're us.

142
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,750
We're pirates!

143
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,200
And I know this is shameless,but
you seem like a nice person,

144
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,730
so we have a favor to ask!

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,440
Could you tell us where the docks
are?We're in a really big hurry!

146
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,210
Pirates!!

147
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,260
That scream!

148
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,280
Kobato-san!

149
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,970
Kobato-san! What happened?!

150
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,330
Kobato-san!

151
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,310
Something happened inside!

152
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,760
Alright! Knock it down!

153
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,270
Kobato-san!

154
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,500
Are you all right?!

155
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,260
Kobato-san!

156
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,650
W-What the--?

157
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,450
Are you alright?! Hey, say something!

158
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,810
What?! They escaped through the ducts?!

159
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,870
So they escaped through there?

160
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,210
Y-Yes! Hurry and catch them!

161
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
You're awake, Dr. Kobato--

162
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,110
Sorry! I understand why you want to shout,

163
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,100
but could you stay quiet for a bit?

164
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,490
Nami! Let's get out of here, quick!

165
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,160
C-Come to think of it, who are you?

166
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,670
Eh? Me?

167
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,760
Oh, it's me.

168
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,380
I, umm, ate a Devil Fruit,
so I can transform.

169
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,960
She is such a ditz.

170
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,920
Oh, yeah. Dr. Kobato. I knowhow
hard it is to understand,

171
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,710
but there's no time toexplain
the details right now.

172
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,060
It's all right. Nothing
elsecan surprise me now.

173
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,190
Well, we gotta go. There's notelling
when the marines'll be back.

174
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,680
Oh, wait! Mr. Deer!

175
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,590
Even if you are a pirate and a magical deer,

176
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,210
you taught me what it means to be a doctor!

177
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,390
I'd, uhh, like to thank you somehow...

178
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,940
I don't need thanks...

179
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,880
And I'm not a deer. I'm a reindeer!

180
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,110
Oh, right! You're looking for the docks!

182
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,920
I could lead the way, if you'd like!

183
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,420
You'll take us there?!

184
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,300
B-But won't you get introuble
for helping pirates?

185
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,510
Yes. But if things turn bad, I can
justpretend I've been taken hostage!

186
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,770
Good thinking!

187
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,530
So if I can be of help...

188
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,190
Looks like they can't see us here.

189
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,240
No, don't let your guard down.The
old fortress guy is tough.

190
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,040
You're the one whoshouldn't
let his guard down!

191
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,540
Dock 88 is on the other side of that!

192
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,460
That's where the Going Merry's being kept!

193
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,980
But it looks like we'll run
into lots of trouble...

194
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,190
How about up there?

195
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,980
It seems crossable!

196
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,310
But it's strange. There's no one there.

197
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,200
It's almost like they're inviting us up...

198
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,870
A trap, huh?

199
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,440
A trap?!

200
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,400
It's the same either way! Plus,I've
decided that we're leaving!

201
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,730
And worrying aboutannoying crap is annoying.

202
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,430
Doesn't matter what traps come our way.

203
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,910
Hey, Luffy! Ahh, Sanji! Not you too, Zoro!

204
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,780
No, I don't wanna go!

205
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,310
If you get caught in a trap,I'm
not gonna come save you!

206
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,520
Without my help, you're gonna
die!Is that what you want?!

207
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,380
But save me if I get in trouble, okay?!

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,050
Where's my reply?!

209
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,540
Where is your ship?

210
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,270
There are actually many docks here...

211
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,170
Judging from where our ship landed,

212
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,720
it's probably in a dock onthe
western side of the base.

213
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,370
The western side? Then Isuppose
it could be Dock 88...

214
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,550
What makes you think that, Kobato-san?

215
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,050
Yes, well, because of
budget cuts and all that,

216
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,220
our number of docks has been reduced.

217
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,200
But there's still equipment in that one,

218
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,430
and actually, that's where my father is!

219
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,790
It's right by where that warship is stopped.

220
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,490
What do we do, Nami? Are they headed there?

221
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,870
There's no way for us to know right now.

222
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,460
Now that they've already causedtrouble,
we can't just sit around idly!

223
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,040
Let's rely on Dr. Kobato to lead the way!

224
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,570
There's no one here...

225
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,310
That's perfect, then! Let's get going!

226
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,400
Hey!

227
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,930
Wait, Luffy! You moron!

228
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,310
He never learns...

229
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,180
So high up! Yikes!

230
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,260
Oh! There they are!

231
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,710
See! W-What did I tell ya?!

232
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,300
So that's the score. Looks likethis'll
be a good little workout...

233
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,020
I'm leaving, no matter what!

234
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,080
We, the Hot-Blooded Unit of Navarone,will
guard this bridge to the death!

235
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,660
We will never let the likesof
you pirates cross it!

236
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,690
Don't be so damn boastful.

237
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,030
Just sit there and wait while I have a smoke.

238
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,510
Don't underestimate us!

239
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,220
♪ We are the Navarone Marines! ♪

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,350
♪ We'll show you our fiery spirit! ♪

241
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,440
That's neat! Is this how it goes?

242
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,930
Charge!

243
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,320
Gatling!

244
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,620
Zoro!

245
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,450
Outta the way!

246
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,190
Okay!

247
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,960
Alright! Zoro! Fight bravely!

248
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,700
Prepare yourself, Straw Hat!

249
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,380
That's neat! Gum-Gum...

250
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,300
Now!

251
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,180
We studied your moves, Straw Hat!

252
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,250
W-What?! What?!

253
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,610
Don't be interruptin' my smoke break!

254
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,780
Bastards...

255
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,910
Your fates end here!

256
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,620
Damn crappy marine!

257
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,950
Hey, guys! What're you doing?!Fight
for real, will ya?!

258
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,750
I have you now!

259
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,880
H-Huh?!

260
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,650
I chopped with all my strength!

261
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,810
An Impact Dial!

262
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,010
There's... no end to 'em!

263
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,480
Listen up, you lousy pirates!

264
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,860
We're the "N" at the beginning of "Navarone"!

265
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,960
We'll risk our spirit to make sureyou
pirates never cross this bridge!

266
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,670
Shut the hell up, you stone-head!

267
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,160
Oww!

268
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,620
Ugh. There's no end to this!

269
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,960
Those are neat things you have!

270
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,930
Gum-Gum...

271
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,950
...Bazooka!

272
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,970
Now! Grab his arms whilethey're slowed down!

273
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,940
I'm not letting go this time!

274
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,560
You're so stubborn!

275
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,570
Gum-Gum...

276
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,460
Uh oh.

277
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,830
...Battle-Axe!

278
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,320
Geez. You never thinkabout the consequences!

279
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm sorry...

280
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,790
Well, let's go. Which way is it?

281
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh. That way.

282
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,470
Commander!

283
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,220
Part of the Straw Gate has been demolished,

284
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,700
and the Straw Hats have fallen into the bay.

285
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,060
Moreover, Unit 55 appears to haveno
casualties or missing persons.

286
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,850
Whoa, now! That's clearlyfar
too much destruction!

287
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,560
Those guys...

288
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,770
But they did buy us 22 minutes.

289
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,160
You showed us your fiery spirit, Unit 55.

290
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:14,010
Commander! The special captureoperation
at Dock 88 is ready!

291
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,260
We can now capture the Straw Hats!

292
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,930
Excellent. They've passed through Straw Gate,

293
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,920
so they're definitely headed for Dock 88.

294
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,850
Stay calm, and don't let your guard down!

295
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,280
You're sure it's this way, Usopp?!

296
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,350
Don't worry! This is it! Just keep moving!

297
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,940
Here they come!

298
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,390
Commence the capture operation!

299
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,600
Wha--?!

300
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,050
There's an urgent patientat
the dock! Let us through!

301
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,090
--Nami-san nurse!--W-What is this?!

302
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,590
--Nami-san nurse!--W-What is this?!

303
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,040
L-Luffy!

304
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,110
Yo...

305
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

306
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

307
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

308
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

309
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

310
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

311
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

312
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,070
Flare bombs can't shut my eyes!

313
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,120
Impressive, moss-head!

314
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,790
Thanks, fancy-eyebrows!

315
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,230
Bring it on, moss-head!

316
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,570
You crappy cook!

317
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,230
This is no time to be arguing!

318
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,340
You will never reach your ship!

319
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm out of strength again...

320
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

321
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,320
"Breaking Through the Siege!The
Going Merry Is Recovered"
