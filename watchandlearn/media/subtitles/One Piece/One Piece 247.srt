00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,290
To think that you left the friends
you traveled together with

3
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,590
all the way from the East Blue, for the ship...

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,550
What are you guys crying for?

5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,590
You dummy! We're not crying, you dummy!

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,800
But it's true that I was moved by your
protecting this ship all by yourself

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,010
while all those things were happening!

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,600
We're not crying! None of us are crying!

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,900
What the heck is their problem?

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,990
Anyway, now you know that those guys
and I are no longer friends, right?!

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,740
I'll...

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,530
I'll sing about your hardships!

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,740
The song title is, "Severed Friendship!
Northern Wind Chop!"

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,700
Yay! Bro!

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,710
Are you making fun of me?!

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,420
Bro!

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,840
Help...

18
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,600
I'll say hello to "Bro" for you.

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,020
We now know the location.

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,480
Let's go.

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,430
Mister, I made some tea.
Why don't you take a break?

22
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,890
Hm? Oh, thanks. I'll have some
once I finish fixing this spot.

23
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,320
Ouch!

24
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,290
So, brother...

25
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,870
Hm?

26
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm gonna get to the main issue.

27
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,330
What're you gonna do after you fix that ship?

28
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,590
What am I gonna do?

29
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,800
Of course, I'll go on an
adventure with her again,

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
and someday we'll go back
to our home, the East Blue!

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,300
It's not like we went around the world,

32
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,890
but this is a ship that went to the Grand Line.

33
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,970
It'll be good enough to
call it a triumphant return.

34
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,430
I'll hold my head up and--

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,060
No, you won't be able to go back...

36
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,730
...to the East Blue.

37
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
To begin with, it's too far.

38
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,070
Bro?

39
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,490
When we pulled up the ship earlier,

40
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,960
I was observing her very carefully.

41
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,670
Stop it, you bastards! What're you
gonna do with the Merry?!

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,380
Take off the ropes! Let the ship down!

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,720
If you do something to the Merry,
my 8,000 men will teach you a lesson!

44
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,340
Hey, are you listening, you bikini jerk?!

45
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,640
If you underestimate me, you'll regret it!

46
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,140
I'm Captain Usopp, the king of
the East Blue who is feared by all!

47
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,310
--Shut up.
--Ow, ow, ow...

48
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,520
Don't pinch me.

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,150
Be quiet.

50
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,490
Shut up! Ouch!

51
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,280
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

52
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,700
That ship is at the end of her life.

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,910
The assessment by Galley-La is correct.

54
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,790
As someone who's in the demolition business,

55
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,460
I suggest you demolish her.

56
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,460
What? That's ridiculous!

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,920
I'll help you demolish your ship!

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,800
What?! What're you saying, you jerk?!

59
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,060
Wait! What're you doing?! Stop right there!

60
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,970
Bro!

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,140
I'm just saying I'll help you demolish that ship.

62
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,820
Don't be ridiculous! I won't allow that!

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,820
The Merry is my ship!

64
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,070
No...! She's...

65
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,530
...no longer a ship.

66
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,370
What?

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,870
What'd you say?!

68
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,040
I asked you earlier what you were gonna
do after you fixed this ship, didn't I?

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,460
If you were going to offer your
life to the sea with this ship,

70
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,590
I wouldn't have said anything.

71
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,020
But... you said that you wanted to
go back to the East Blue on this ship.

72
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,020
So I'm trying to stop you... brother.

73
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,900
This ship... can no longer
even reach the next shore.

74
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,320
Listen. Ships are born with a promise

75
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:13,250
to carry you across the sea
from one shore to another.

76
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,290
In other words, once a ship can
no longer carry you to shore...

77
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,630
Hey!

78
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,300
Stop it!

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,550
Once she can't carry you to shore...

80
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,430
...she's no longer a ship!

81
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,260
Bro!

82
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,610
Stop it!

83
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,700
It's all right! Now let's move forward

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,660
with the sun always in our hearts

85
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,000
As power passes through our clasped hands

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

87
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:19,650
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

88
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

89
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

90
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:41,080
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

91
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,460
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

92
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,420
but what you cherish most will be right there

93
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,390
And if you get into a jam

94
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,470
I'll always be there to protect you

95
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,640
It's all right! Now let's move forward

96
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,190
with the sun always in our hearts

97
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,190
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

98
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,450
and gaze at the light beyond

99
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

100
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,700
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

101
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,660
So let's grab hold of our wishes

102
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

103
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,090
One Piece

104
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:45,020
"The Man Who Is Loved Even
by His Ship! Usopp's Tears!"

105
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,160
You bastard! Move away from Merry!

106
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,880
You son of a bitch!

107
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,800
If you don't get it...

108
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,060
...take a good look at her...
with your own eyes!

109
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,140
Sorry, Merry.

110
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,730
I'll fix you right away.

111
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,400
I'll fix you right away... I'll...

112
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,150
As many times as you need...

113
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,610
I'll fix you as many times as you need!

114
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,610
As many times as you need!

115
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,620
Hey! Enough already, Long-nose!

116
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,460
You saw the bottom of the ship, right?!

117
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,580
With the broken keel at the root of her,

118
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,590
the outer panels are slipping off
and the frames are torn, too!

119
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,880
When a ship is like that, she'll just fall
apart from the outside with each wave!

120
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,470
And yet, you think a total
amateur like you can...

121
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,270
Shut up!

122
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,770
I don't want you to tell me anything!

123
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,780
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll
beat you up, you hooligan!

124
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,090
At...

125
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,760
At heart...

126
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,520
...I know it.

127
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,270
Huh?! What did you say?!

128
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,520
At heart...

129
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,650
At heart...

130
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,700
At heart... I know it all.

131
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,830
I... I...

132
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,590
I know that Merry is at the end of her life!

133
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,410
At heart...

134
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,450
I... know...

135
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,290
When I heard the assessment,

136
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,040
I was convinced that what I saw
on that day really happened.

137
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,840
First, I thought I was dreaming.

138
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,090
I thought there was no way
something like that could happen.

139
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,890
On one foggy night...
in a forest under the moonlight,

140
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,560
I heard the strikes of a wooden hammer.

141
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,150
The sound was coming from the ship,

142
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,940
although no one was supposed
to be on her at the time.

143
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,660
It came from our ship, which was
scarred and washed ashore.

144
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,660
It was very foggy, but I
definitely saw someone there...

145
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,000
...striking a wooden hammer.

146
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,920
I couldn't figure out who it was.

147
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,220
But then, when the morning came the next day,

148
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,260
the ship was lousily fixed.

149
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,970
The completely broken mast
was also fixed as it used to be.

150
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,480
But the really mysterious thing was that...

151
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:26,730
...whoever fixed the Merry
knew how she originally looked.

152
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,490
Despite the fact that we
had added lots of tweaks,

153
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,490
this person put the Merry back
to how she used to look!

154
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,450
Everything was a mystery to us, but...

155
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,960
...for some reason, these words
remained in my heart.

156
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,420
I don't even know if this person actually
said it or I was imagining things...

157
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,380
Don't worry.

158
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,810
I'll carry you guys for a little bit longer.

159
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,480
This may sound stupid, but...

160
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,820
...I feel that it might've been
an incarnation of the Merry.

161
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,700
I bet the ship was already at her limits then.

162
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,500
So she might've turned into
that form to let us know it.

163
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,460
When I heard the assessment,
that's what I thought.

164
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,510
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
You don't have to believe me.

165
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,600
Bro?

166
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Believe you?

167
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,570
This person looked like a sailor
holding a wooden hammer, right?

168
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,110
What...? Why...?

169
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,190
Do you know?

170
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,570
Brother...

171
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,370
You saw a Klabautermann.

172
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,910
K-Klabau...?

173
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,540
Klabautermann.

174
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,460
It's one of the legends known among sailors.

175
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,380
It's a fairy that dwells only on a ship
that's treated with great care.

176
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,090
Well, you could say it's a ship's incarnation.

177
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,220
They carry wooden hammers in their hands

178
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,810
and are dressed in sailor's raincoats.

179
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,430
When danger approaches the ship,

180
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,940
they run around inside the ship
and let people know about it.

181
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,440
It is said that they sometimes
help sailors quite a bit.

182
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,740
But to be honest, this is the first time
I've heard someone say they saw one.

183
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,200
The more care the ship receives,
the more it appreciates the sailors.

184
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,170
This ship probably wanted to somehow
carry you across to the other shore.

185
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:54,710
She was able to encounter a crew
that she wanted to carry so badly

186
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,550
that she'd borrow a human form to appear...

187
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,640
I bet she's been very happy.

188
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,310
Merry...

189
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,190
I see...

190
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,570
Then, the one...

191
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,120
...who talked to me then...

192
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,910
...was really you, huh?

193
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,120
Merry...

194
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,550
At any rate, for Heaven's sake...

195
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:45,600
You had a big fight with your friends
knowing your ship is at her limits, then?

196
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,350
It's not that simple.

197
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,150
How inept men are!

198
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,820
They're fools!

199
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,830
Looks like someone's here.

200
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,750
"Someone's here"? Who else could
it be but Zambai and the others!

201
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,340
Why did they take the trouble
of coming from the sea side?

202
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,090
Yeah... when they usually
use the upper entrance...

203
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,760
They might've brought Straw Hat.

204
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,310
Oh, that's right!

205
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,060
I forgot that I sent for Straw Hat
and the others with you as bait!

206
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,350
They won't come. We're no longer friends.

207
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,060
I told you so, didn't I?

208
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,570
Why aren't they coming in?

209
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,740
Okay, okay. I'll open the door now!

210
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,460
Okay, okay. Geez, stop ringing the bell!

211
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,920
Brother... Go back to your friends.

212
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,970
I can't do that now. I fought
a duel with my captain.

213
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,560
Besides, the ship stuff isn't settled yet, so...

214
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,020
What do you mean it hasn't been settled?

215
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,980
If you know that your ship can't
sail anymore, it's simple, isn't it?

216
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,320
Leave her with me.

217
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
I'll take care of her in a way
that you'd approve of.

218
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
What I did earlier, too, you know...

219
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,580
I tried to destroy the ship thinking
that it would be best for you.

220
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,210
Don't stick your nose
into things! It's my business!

221
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,340
--Hey, I'm trying to solve your problem!
--Is it Zambai?

222
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,590
You should appreciate it!

223
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,180
I should appreciate it? Give me a break!

224
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,430
Don't you get it?! It's a
nuisance for the ship, too!

225
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,060
She loves you guys so much that
she appeared in human form.

226
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,860
If she sinks in the middle of the sea
while you guys are on board...

227
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,410
Hey! If that happens, even if she dies,
she'll be filled with regret!

228
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,320
She won't be able to rest in peace!

229
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,330
Then, when your friends are dying,
can you just leave them saying,

230
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,080
"Well, I hope you die
without suffering at least"?!

231
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,710
If you put it that way,
that's a whole different discussion!

232
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,880
No, it's not! It's that kind of matter!

233
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
You just don't get it, do you?!

234
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,010
Huh?!

235
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,020
Mozu!

236
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,520
Kiwi!

237
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,230
Wh-Who's there?!

238
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,360
Pardon me... for interrupting.

239
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,830
It's just, these two ladies didn't let us in, so...

240
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,790
The secretary at Galley-La!

241
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,050
What the hell are you bastards doing here?!

242
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,330
We had a dream that day

243
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,160
Our belief in ourselves

244
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:47,300
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

245
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:56,850
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

246
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:07,030
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

247
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:15,740
In the end, we can all surely smile

248
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,380
Galley-La! What the hell are you bastards...

249
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,090
We're Government
intelligence agents, Cutty Flam.

250
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,630
Why do you know that name?!

251
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,430
You've been entrusted with something
by the legendary shipwright Tom.

252
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,310
Now, could you please hand over your secret?

253
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

254
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,690
"Franky's Past! The Day the Sea Train First Ran"

255
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
