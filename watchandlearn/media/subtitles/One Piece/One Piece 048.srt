00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,640
Wow! What a huge town!

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,420
The place used to be full of pirates
on their way to the Grand Line.

23
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,780
It has everything you could ever need!

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,680
Alright! I'm gonna go get equipment

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,660
for our upcoming great adventure!

26
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,360
Looks like I can get
some good ingredients here.

27
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,250
Good women, too!

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
I got something I wanna buy, too.

29
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,230
Oh? How are you gonna do that?

30
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,600
You're flat broke, as I recall!

31
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,530
Alright! I'm gonna check
out the execution platform!

32
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,220
Huh?

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,340
I'm gonna see where the King
of the Pirates was executed!

34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,640
Hey, wait! We still haven't
decided where to meet up at!

35
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,520
Man, that guy...

36
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,480
The King of the Pirates was
born here and died here!

37
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,770
He might've even walked
down this very street!

38
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,970
Yahoo!

39
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,490
"The Town of the Beginning and End;
Landfall at Loguetown"

40
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,130
--How's this?
--Oh! You look wonderful, Miss!

41
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,380
--How's this?
--You look so elegant, Miss!

42
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,510
--How's this?
--Elemental, Miss!

43
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,310
--How's this?
--Electrical!

44
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,840
--How's this?
--Elegy!

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,340
Will you be purchasing all of these?

46
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,930
No, I don't want 'em.

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,050
I want something that's rougher.

48
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,310
Come again!

49
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,610
Oh! A top-quality aperitif!

50
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,070
Oh! Two Poinderine
champagne-like beauties!

51
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,090
The whole town is brimming with
the finest ingredients around!

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,820
Damn, I can't decide
what to go after first!

53
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,780
I just found the main dish!

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,040
"Love-Love Pirates"

55
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,770
Awesome! What is this place?!

56
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,240
Everything here is a collector's dream!

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,630
Welcome!

58
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,680
Everything here once belonged to pirates

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,600
who returned alive from the Grand Line!

60
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,590
They are especially valuable goods.

61
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,060
Then these are all items that went
on adventures in the Grand Line?!

62
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,330
That's absolutely correct!

63
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,330
We only do business
with warriors of the sea here,

64
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,070
so we warmly welcome
gentlemen such as yourself!

65
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,710
What do you say?

66
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,460
This was the favorite gun
of the Gold Roger!

67
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,020
What?! Gold Roger's?!

68
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,130
Yes!

69
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,430
How about it, sir?

70
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,790
S-Show me more!

71
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,860
Thanks! Come again!

72
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,080
Captain Smoker! Terrible news!

73
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,060
A message from Headquarters!

74
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,240
They've received word that a
Monkey D. Luffy and his pirate crew

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,110
are headed here, to Loguetown!

76
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,010
He just earned a 30 million
Berry bounty in the East Blue!

77
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,900
30 million...
That's worthy of congratulation.

78
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,720
He's an incredibly evil villain

79
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,490
who even defeated Don Krieg
and Arlong the fishman!

80
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,870
Quiet!

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,510
Damn your shouting.
You made it fall apart.

82
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,390
I'm sorry, sir!

83
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,490
It's not good to be tense.

84
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,980
I got my own pace I do things at.

85
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,280
Isn't that right?

86
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,730
Y-Yes, sir!

87
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,940
So... What, now?

88
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,440
Right! A pirate group!

89
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,790
Word has it they may
show up in town today, yes!

90
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,920
What're you so flustered for?

91
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,060
Have any pirates who've set
foot into this town ever escaped

92
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,100
since I took charge here?

93
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,290
N-No, sir...

94
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,370
Then calm the hell down.
You're gonna screw up my pace.

95
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,810
Yes, sir...

96
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,830
Reporting, sir!

97
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,340
We have word that pirates
have appeared at the port!

98
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,730
Please go there at once!

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,130
It must be Luffy's group!
They've definitely set foot into town!

100
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,220
30 million, huh?

101
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,380
I pray he puts up
at least a bit of a fight.

102
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,370
Sir?

103
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,230
Just talking to myself. Forget it.

104
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,610
You're not going to look at this?!

105
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,030
"Justice"

106
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,800
Captain! Please give
each unit their orders!

107
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,870
No need.

108
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,570
But you need to
consider how powerful he is!

109
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,750
You're annoying me.

110
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,570
Don't tell me what to do!

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,790
My apologies, sir!

112
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Never mind that. Where's Tashigi?

113
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,320
Y-Yes. She mentioned she
would be gone this morning,

114
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,350
but that she'd show up for training.

115
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,140
That dumb girl.
Where the hell'd she go?

116
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,990
Yay! A triple-scoop ice cream!

117
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,730
Hold on, now!
You'll drop them if you run!

118
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,840
C-Captain Smoker!

119
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,030
M-My ice cream...

120
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,490
I-I'm very sorry about my daughter!

121
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,790
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

122
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,730
Sorry 'bout that.
My pants ate your ice cream.

123
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,870
Here, buy yourself five scoops.

124
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,470
Let's go.

125
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,210
Yes, sir!

126
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,900
T-Thank you!

127
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,670
Thanks!

128
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,730
Loot everything there is!
Don't leave a single potato behind!

129
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,250
I, Gally the Crescent-sama,
will use these vital food supplies

130
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,440
on my way to becoming
King of the Pirates!

131
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,370
Hand it all over thankfully!

132
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,320
Hey.

133
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,120
Who's in charge here?

134
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,540
What do you want?!

135
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,740
So you're Monkey D. Luffy?

136
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,500
I'll test you and see if you're
worthy of setting foot into my town.

137
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,040
Don't give me your crap!

138
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,090
Get 'im!

139
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,920
Captain Smoker?

140
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,040
Yeah. He's one of the toughest
guys from Navy Headquarters.

141
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,580
This town used to be a hangout
for pirates headed for the Grand Line.

142
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,620
But ever since he took over, every
single pirate who's come into town

143
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,990
has wound up in the slammer.

144
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,490
His strength is extraordinary.
He's a monster.

145
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,630
They even say he has
Devil Fruit powers...

146
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,490
Devil Fruit powers?!

147
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,860
Incredible, Captain! You captured
Luffy's crew in no time flat!

148
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,650
Are your eyes just for decoration?
This guy obviously isn't Luffy.

149
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,610
Eh?

150
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,350
The world'd be ending if this
shabby fly were worth 30 million.

151
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,290
T-Then, where is Luffy?

152
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,850
He'll show up soon enough.

153
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,350
The fun is just getting started.

154
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,840
Huh?

155
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,530
How did I wind up at the port? How?

156
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,770
Hey!

157
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,200
Is he one of these guys?

158
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,370
I don't know. I don't think so...

159
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,470
Perfect timing! Do you know how
to get to the execution platform?

160
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,810
The execution platform?

161
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,840
I got lost on my way...

162
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,630
I've never seen you around before.

163
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,610
Yeah! I just landed on this island!

164
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,000
This town sure is huge!

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,690
It's way different from Fusha Village!

166
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,590
Why are you looking for
the execution platform?

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,300
I wanna see the place where
the King of the Pirates died!

168
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,550
You don't know where? Aww...

169
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,100
Wait. Follow the smoke.

170
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,620
Oh! That way?! Thanks!

171
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,170
Damn, these are expensive!
Too expensive!

172
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,520
Lend you money? Sure!

173
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,070
But including interest, you'll hafta
pay me 300% of what you borrow!

174
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,660
I can't afford to borrow
any more from that girl...

175
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,000
But I can't go into the Grand Line
stuck with just one sword...

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,270
--What do I do?
--"Monster"?! How rude!

177
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,940
Aww, shut up!

178
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,970
Our boss is behind bars all thanks to him!

179
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,310
Have you still not learned your lesson?!

180
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,040
Nope! We ain't happy
with things as they are!

181
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,110
We're gonna bring
your corpse to him to see!

182
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,950
Very well. I will fight you.

183
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,640
You will, girlie?!

184
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,410
Don't make us laugh!

185
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,530
What can a girl possibly do?!

186
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
--Die!
--Yeah!

187
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,640
She did it!

188
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,690
You're strong, lady!

189
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,550
You're amazing!

190
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,400
Oww!

191
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,070
--I can't tell if she's strong or weak!
--Glasses! Glasses! Glasses!

192
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,420
Glasses...

193
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,730
Hey. Are these them?

194
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,120
S-Sorry to bother you!

195
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,580
Thank you!

196
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,630
My glasses!

197
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,040
I-I didn't mean to!

198
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,970
Those were expensive! How could
you do something so horrible?!

199
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,260
I told you, I didn't mean to--!

200
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,430
Pay me back for them!

201
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,020
Oh, man.

202
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,080
I was trying to get to
the execution platform,

203
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,500
but now I'm somewhere else completely.

204
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,510
Oh, well. I'll get
there sooner or later.

205
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,990
Is it this way?

206
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,050
Let's see...

207
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,360
Gold... Roger?

208
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,410
Do you work here, old guy?

209
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,580
It said "Gold Roger"
on the sign outside...

210
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,180
Is that this place's name?

211
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,970
Scram.

212
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,230
This ain't a place for a runt like you.

213
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,240
Besides, we're closed
for good as of today.

214
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,020
It went under?

215
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,980
It didn't go under!
I'm shutting it down myself!

216
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,640
Now get lost!

217
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,380
I was just curious about
the name, that's all.

218
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm lost.

219
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,650
I was wanting to go to
the execution platform...

220
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,670
Can you tell me how to get there?

221
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,750
What's that on your table?

222
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,330
Oh! A skull?!

223
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,870
It's huge!

224
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,730
This is what became of a guy
once known as Killer Giant.

225
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,870
A villain who sent hundreds
of pirates to the afterlife.

226
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,810
But Gold Roger sent him to
his grave with just one blow.

227
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,770
Gold Roger did?!

228
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,610
With truly lightning speed!

229
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,180
This guy was famous for the
absurdly huge blade he used,

230
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,440
but their fight ended
in the blink of an eye!

231
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,150
And this is the wound he received!

232
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,520
But he was an infamous scoundrel himself!

233
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,660
With his dying breath, he muttered,

234
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,960
"Roger... My hat's off to you...

235
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,870
May you have honor
as the Eternal Pirate..."

236
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,190
So awesome! So cool!

237
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,840
Eric Down,
the man known as King...

238
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,690
Silver Silver,
the world's greatest gunman...

239
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,800
The giant Gowns Brothers...

240
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,280
They were all tough men
who were as feared as demons.

241
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,340
But for Gold Roger,
they were as weak as infants.

242
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,690
Would ya like to hear more?

243
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,700
Yeah!

244
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,000
Very few people these days
believe this story, you know...

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,660
That's okay! Just tell me!

246
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,140
Hold your horses.

247
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,470
Gold Roger...

248
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,500
In those days...
no, even still, I guess...

249
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,470
...he was the one and only man
who didn't fear the Grand Line.

250
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,540
Back then, the Grand Line
was an unknown area,

251
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,900
from which not a single boat ever
returned after being swallowed up.

252
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,970
It was a sea of evil that people
feared and which few approached!

253
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,070
Old man. Give me more rum.
The whole bottle'll do.

254
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,650
You sure are drinking happily, Roger.

255
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,990
Of course I am.

256
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,370
I'm just about to take a
little stroll into the Grand Line.

257
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,740
I'm excited beyond belief.

258
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,950
Whoa! You're going there?!
Into that sea of evil?!

259
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,180
What? Is there something
wrong with that?

260
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,590
No, not exactly, but...

261
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,160
Take my advice.
Forget about going there.

262
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,170
No one's ever come back!

263
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,600
That's why I'm going.

264
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,870
Now, then. Give me more rum.
A whole barrel'll do.

265
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,640
After saying that,
he drank the whole place dry,

266
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,860
then set sail all too
casually the next morning.

267
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,850
When I heard he had conquered
the Grand Line a bit later,

268
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,850
I was more happy
than I was surprised--

269
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,410
I was more excited than
I should have been at my age!

270
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,180
And then, 22 years ago today,
Roger died on the execution platform.

271
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,230
Ever since that day, everyone
proud of their great strength

272
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,290
has tossed their hat
into the pirate ring.

273
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,980
It marked the beginning
of the Great Pirate Era!

274
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,940
But now look! The town's full of
nothing but cowards and scum now!

275
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,880
Men crazy enough to challenge that
sea of evil are all but gone now!

276
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,160
That's why this bar is
closing down for good today.

277
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,530
I'm going to the Grand Line, too!

278
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,570
Huh?!

279
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,460
Gold Roger's so cool...

280
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,530
He's how a pirate should be!

281
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,760
That's why I set out to sea.

282
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,170
I'm gonna go to the Grand Line,
get the One Piece,

283
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,070
and be King of the Pirates!

284
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,800
Those're some mighty big words!

285
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,330
And in this bar, of all places!

286
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,600
I only said what I meant.

287
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,490
Kiddo! If there're still
patrons like you out there,

288
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,890
maybe I'll hold off on closing this place!

289
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,600
How should I know if there are?!

290
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,560
You're right!
Of course you wouldn't know!

291
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,000
I haven't been in such
a good mood since then!

292
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,280
I'll treat you to a drink!

293
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,370
I don't drink alcohol.

294
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,660
Right! Then have this!

295
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,490
Let's have a toast!
To the Eternal King of the Pirates!

296
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,130
To the Eternal King of the Pirates!

297
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,560
You?!

298
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,330
That's certainly a warm hello...

299
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,310
...for a regular patron of yours.

300
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,030
Cut the crap! You're tryin'
to shut the place down!

301
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,940
It's wrong of you to
hold a grudge against me.

302
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,440
I only come here as a loyal customer.

303
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,040
It's the pirates' fault that
they're all cowards these days.

304
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,550
You had a customer? How rare.

305
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,990
I'd like a drink of rum...

306
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,380
There is no alcohol for you here!

307
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,100
Don't be so iron-hearted.

308
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,850
Today's a special day.

309
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,610
Wouldn't you agree?

310
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,110
That's the stuff...

311
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,470
Even now, I remember that day clearly...

312
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,450
How Roger looked at the very end...

313
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,920
This is Main Street!

314
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,430
Did Gold Roger walk through here, too?!

315
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,420
Yes...

316
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,270
It was a humid afternoon,
just like today...

317
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,100
His hands were shackled as
he was led down the main street

318
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,140
toward the town square,
where the execution platform stood...

319
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,630
Yet, he walked like
a triumphant general.

320
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,170
Wealth, fame, power...

321
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,570
Gold Roger had attained everything
the world has to offer...

322
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,510
Even though he was
walking toward death,

323
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,180
he was literally
a king of great pride...

324
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,640
Inherited will...

325
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,210
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

326
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,940
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

327
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,870
these things will never cease to be.

328
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,830
Do you have any last words?!

329
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,880
Take this off for me.
It's itchy beyond belief.

330
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,170
I can't do that!

331
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,880
Do you think I would run away?

332
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,920
You sure know how
to make a guy feel lonely.

333
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,940
All right, let's get
this over with quickly.

334
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,000
Hey, Pirate King!

335
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,780
Where did you hide
all the treasure you found?!

336
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,960
Is it in the Grand Line?!

337
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,380
You got it, didn't you?!
That legendary treasure!

338
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,820
Shut up, you!

339
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,350
That great treasure!

340
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,160
The One Piece!

341
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,490
My treasure?

342
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,880
Don't speak without permission!

343
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,740
If you want it, you can have it!

344
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,410
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

345
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,000
Execution!

346
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,300
That's how it all began...

347
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,450
Hey!

348
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,130
A new wanted poster!
Put it up somewhere noticeable!

349
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,780
C-Captain Smoker!
Sorry for the rudeness, sir!

350
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,260
U-Umm...

351
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,460
That Straw Hat...

352
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,340
It was Monkey D. Luffy!

353
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,390
There it is...

354
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,970
So this is where the King
of the Pirates was executed...

355
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,730
The place where the
greatest pirate in history died...

356
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,850
The place where it began...

357
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,000
My overflowing feelings don't connect

358
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,840
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

359
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,760
I'll set off by myself,

360
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,720
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

361
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,480
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

362
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,570
Why is it so hot?

363
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:55,580
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

364
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

365
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,630
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

366
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,380
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

367
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,780
With you, I can run there

368
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,410
Ahh! This is a town
for meeting pretty women!

369
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,800
Pretty women, indeed...

370
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,050
We can't relax! The marines
here are supposedly tough!

371
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,190
We just got here!

372
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,820
How about you?
Did you buy your swords?

373
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,690
That's the problem. In any case,
I gotta get me two more swords.

374
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,380
On the next episode of One Piece!

375
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,800
"Kitetsu III and Yubashiri! Zoro's New
Swords and the Woman Sergeant Major"

376
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
