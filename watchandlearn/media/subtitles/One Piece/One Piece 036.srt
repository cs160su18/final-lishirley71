2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,640
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,090
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,820
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,970
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,730
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,320
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,970
If there's anyone we can't
abandon, it's Bellemere!

25
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,800
Damn! Why did this have to happen?!
Don't act hasty, Bellemere!

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,430
Delicious! Nothing's quite like
my special tangerine sauce!

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,420
Ten more minutes for
the duck in the oven.

28
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,200
Got the side of vegetables...

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,090
And the stew is boiling.

30
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,440
Now just some fried rice omelets,
and everything's ready!

31
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,800
This'll be a big blow
to our family budget.

32
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,220
Oh, are they back?

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,680
"Survive! Mother Bellemere
and Nami's Bond!"

34
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,020
It's open! Come on in!

35
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,110
Pardon me...

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,230
Too bad. I'm a former marine.

37
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,260
What brings Grand Line pirates
all the way out to Cocoyashi Village?

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,280
What's so funny?!

39
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,840
Powerless! Powerless!
Powerless! Powerless! Powerless!

40
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,250
How powerless your
inferior species is!

41
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,140
Let's escape with her
out the back door!

42
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,910
But the pirates might already be there!

43
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,940
We'll be fine!

44
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,810
Hold it!

45
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,890
Doctor!

46
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,950
You mustn't return home!

47
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,640
Wha...?

48
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,840
Move! We have to save Bellemere-san!

49
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,050
Nojiko! Nami!

50
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,670
Listen closely, you two!

51
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,830
This may not be the best situation to--
no, because of the situation,

52
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,690
I must tell you a somewhat cruel story!

53
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,360
Doctor?

54
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,240
Bellemere-san!

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,820
It's no good!
These guys are real monsters!

56
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,930
I'm gonna be killed!

57
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,400
Nojiko! Nami!

58
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,860
Bellemere!

59
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,820
Don't waste your life for some
pathetic sense of justice!

60
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,870
Some battles aren't worth fighting!

61
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,340
Some issues can be solved with money!

62
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,290
Gen-san...

63
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,160
That's right, marine girl.

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,660
100,000 per adult. 50,000 per kid.

65
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,980
If you can pay for your
whole family, I'll let you live.

66
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,910
You should be thankful I'm telling you.

67
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,140
My whole family?

68
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,880
That's 200,000 total.
How much do you own, all together?

69
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,050
Including what I've squirreled
away... a little over 100,000...

70
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,380
Hey! There's a meal
for three people in here!

71
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,020
Oh? A family of three, huh?

72
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,660
I almost forgot!

73
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,360
She invited me and my
friend to dinner tonight!

74
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,010
Come, Bellemere.
Hurry and pay your amount.

75
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,480
Our delicious food's going to get cold!

76
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,490
Gen-san...

77
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,340
I hear you have 100,000.
Thank goodness you have enough!

78
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,500
Now everyone in the village is spared!

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,020
It's true--

80
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,860
the village register has no record
of her getting married or giving birth.

81
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,930
She's single.

82
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,930
"Single"
"No Family"

83
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,270
Do you understand?!

84
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,020
There's no proof that you two
and Bellemere are family!

85
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,070
Leave this island before
they take notice of you!

86
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,270
Escape across the sea!

87
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,820
There's no other way for
all three of you to survive!

88
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,280
I feel it's reckless to send you two
out to sea at such a young age!

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,290
There's a chance
something bad could happen!

90
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,670
But at least you'll have...

91
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,290
No.

92
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,110
I don't want to!

93
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,910
Why do we have to leave?
They're the ones who came here!

94
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,780
I... want to live in this village...

95
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,460
Is it because we're poor

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,940
that I can't be
Bellemere-san's kid anymore?!

97
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,890
Why? Why?!

98
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,110
Thank goodness. Now they won't kill.

99
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,840
Alright, we'll leave the village!

100
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,680
Nojiko!

101
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,160
Let's go! Because that means
Bellemere-san gets to live!

102
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,010
Hold it.

103
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,290
Who said I paid for me?

104
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,970
That 100,000's for my two daughters.
I don't got enough for me.

105
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,720
Bellemere! What are you...

106
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,080
I'm sorry, Gen-san.

107
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,190
I just can't say
I don't have a family...

108
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,740
Even... if it costs me my life...

109
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,020
How could she?!

110
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,210
Yeah, maybe we're
not related by blood...

111
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,900
...but we're a family.

112
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,000
I want to be their parent,
even if it's only in name.

113
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,500
They're... my kids.

114
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,180
Bellemere-san!

115
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,490
Wait, you two!

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,130
I wish someone richer
had adopted me instead!

117
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,100
It was just a lie! I was lying!

118
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,380
Bellemere-san!

119
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,550
I wanted... to buy you lots
more books and clothes...

120
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,670
I'm sorry!

121
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,310
I was never able to do
anything mother-like for you!

122
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,410
That's not true!

123
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,080
We don't need anything!
Just don't die!

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,820
Stay with us forever!

125
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,660
I want you to see
the world map I draw!

126
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,510
Yeah... Your map...

127
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,860
Make your dream... come true!

128
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,220
Live!

129
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,430
Bellemere-san!

130
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,010
These're your girls, I take it?

131
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,280
Yeah, that's right!

132
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,410
Promise me you won't
lay a hand on them!

133
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,940
Of course! As long as
you die like a good girl!

134
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,830
Help!

135
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,030
Now they're thirsty for blood...

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,890
Don't kill 'em.
Just handle 'em as you see fit.

137
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,890
Perfect timing for our
first example to the others!

138
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,260
Die with your pathetic love.

139
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,210
Nojiko! Nami!

140
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,240
I love you!

141
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,970
You just never learn, do you?!

142
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,940
Let go! I'll pay later!

143
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,800
With my body!

144
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,510
You fool!

145
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,310
You made another boy cry?!

146
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,900
He made me mad!

147
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,410
Blehhh!

148
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,460
It's okay. Kids will be kids.

149
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,520
He said your tangerines
suck, Bellemere-san!

150
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,450
Say what?!

151
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,190
Bellemere!

152
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,850
Don't give in to anyone...

153
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,420
Even girls need to be strong...

154
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,830
It doesn't matter if
people don't praise you!

155
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,120
Don't have hate for this
era you were born in...

156
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Never forget the strength to
be able to smile at any time...

157
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,750
Bellemere-san!

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,930
Under my rule,
anyone without money dies!

159
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,770
Understand, you inferior species?!

160
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,580
What's this?

161
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,860
A sea chart?

162
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,850
No!

163
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,630
I drew that! It's important
to me! Give it back!

164
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,330
You drew it?

165
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,570
Give it back!

166
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,380
Nami! No!

167
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,530
Oh? This is quite impressive.

168
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,080
She's an invaluable asset!
Bring her with us!

169
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Right!

170
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,820
No!

171
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,620
Let go! Let go! No!

172
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,090
Let Nami go! Let go!

173
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,760
Stop!

174
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,930
You got your money!

175
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,930
You promised not
to lay a hand on her!

176
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,270
Yeah. I ain't gonna hurt her.
I'm just gonna borrow her.

177
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,290
Gen-san! Help!

178
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,220
Keep your hands off the children!

179
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,230
Kuroobi.

180
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,410
Gen-san!

181
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,830
Gen-san! Gen-san!

182
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,780
Gen-san!

183
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,370
I'll save you, Nami...

184
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,840
I won't let you pass...

185
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,870
No! It's okay!
You don't need to save me!

186
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,580
Please!

187
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,620
This is getting tedious.

188
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,880
I'll... save...

189
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,840
Please, no more dying!

190
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,090
All of the village's
ships have been sunk...

191
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,990
Our idea of trying to let
Nojiko and Nami escape to sea...

192
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,450
...was too optimistic...

193
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,590
Just as I feared,
the navy won't listen to us.

194
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,780
This island will be under his control.

195
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,210
Bellemere knew!

196
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,020
She fully knew how they work,
from her experience as a marine!

197
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,670
She knew not a single
person could ever escape...

198
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,510
They took Nami with them...

199
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,780
What... am I supposed to
do now... Bellemere-san?

200
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,990
We've found out where
the Arlong Pirates are!

201
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,960
It seems they intend to
settle down on this island!

202
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,830
It's time to decide!

203
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,220
Do we fight now and die defiantly?!

204
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,310
Or do we place our hope in waiting
for help from the government,

205
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,860
while living under the fear
of being killed at any time?!

206
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,210
It's one or the other!

207
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,940
Only Navy Headquarters
stands a chance against them!

208
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,200
But HQ has its hands full
in the Grand Line.

209
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,000
Our hopes of them coming all the
way out here are as good as zero!

210
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,660
But I can't let Nami go!

211
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,280
I'll fight!

212
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,490
Me too! I doubt I can live my life
knowing I abandoned a child!

213
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,830
We're all family here!

214
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,980
Even if it means I die killing them,
I'm gonna save Nacchan!

215
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,830
Bellemere gave her
life up to protect them!

216
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,280
Let's fight 'em again!

217
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,080
They'll blame us all anyway
if just one of us fights!

218
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,930
If you survive, lots
of fun things will happen!

219
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,750
Nami!

220
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,020
Nami!

221
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,880
Nacchan!

222
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,770
You're all right?!

223
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,800
Nami! Nami!

224
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,020
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Did they do anything to you?

225
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,790
Nami?

226
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,410
I'm... joining...

227
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,540
Eh?

228
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,790
I'm joining... the Arlong Pirates...

229
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,130
I'm going to join the Arlong Pirates...

230
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,510
...to be a surveyor and draw sea charts!

231
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,500
What are you saying, Nami?
Are you in your right mind?

232
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,720
Did they do something
horrible to you? Did they?

233
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,270
No.

234
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,900
They threatened you, didn't they?

235
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,480
No!

236
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,380
Say it!

237
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,420
Let go of me!

238
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,870
Nami...

239
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,630
Nami!

240
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,120
T-That's an Arlong tattoo...

241
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:53,990
You...

242
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,410
Nami...

243
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,010
Look at this...
They gave me all this money...

244
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,250
And they say they'll
buy me anything I want...

245
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,740
Nami!

246
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,710
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

247
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,420
Joining pirates is
absolutely unforgivable!

248
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,250
And them, of all people!

249
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,920
Do you even know what
kind of people they are?!

250
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,290
So what?!

251
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,230
If I'm gonna get killed living
a proper life like Bellemere-san,

252
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,800
then I don't wanna live properly!

253
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,520
I can't believe this...

254
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,710
Bellemere-san...

255
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,370
Bellemere-san was killed because of us!

256
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,040
How can you just...

257
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,400
That's enough, Nojiko.

258
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,640
Leave, Nami!

259
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,500
Never step foot into this village again!

260
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,330
Nami!

261
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,480
How could she be so foolish?

262
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,410
Did she not see
Bellemere as her parent?!

263
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,970
No, that's not true...

264
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,700
Nami loved Bellemere-san...

265
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
Hey...

266
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:41,490
Bellemere-san said that if we survive,
fun things will happen, right?

267
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,010
Lots of fun things...

268
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,140
Yeah.

269
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,150
After Arlong dragged me off,

270
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,790
five navy ships came to capture him,

271
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,460
but they were all sunk easily...

272
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,870
I don't think the government will
send any more help to this island.

273
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,370
That's what made me realize
I have to do something.

274
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,090
I made an agreement with Arlong

275
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,830
to buy Cocoyashi Village from him.

276
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,330
To buy the village?

277
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,240
For 100 million Berries.

278
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,120
If I buy the village, we can be free.

279
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,570
No one else will have to die.

280
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,390
In exchange, I have to join his
group and draw sea charts...

281
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,570
B-But, 100 million Berries?

282
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,550
I'm not sure you can earn that
much working your entire life!

283
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,600
I will earn it!
No matter what it takes!

284
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,960
Everyone's working their
hardest to pay the tribute money,

285
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,410
so my only choice is to do it alone.

286
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,470
Because if I ask for help from
anyone, more people will get hurt.

287
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,340
It'll hurt, you know...

288
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,550
Yeah...

289
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,610
Staying with the people who
killed Bellemere-san'll hurt.

290
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,600
I'll be fine. I'll put on a big smile,
even when I see his face!

291
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,700
I've decided not to cry anymore.

292
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,850
I've decided to fight on my own!

293
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,540
Do you know how painful of
a choice it was for Nami

294
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,630
to decide to fight and survive on
her own, at the mere age of 10?

295
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,050
For the only deal that
could save the village, she...

296
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,270
I'll make whoever makes
my beloved Nami-san suffer--

297
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,930
W-Why, Big Sister?

298
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,940
I told you! I came here
to tell you to stop!

299
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,700
If you make a big fuss
about her being your friend,

300
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,400
the pirates'll grow suspicious of Nami

301
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,320
and her eight years of fighting
will be all for nothing!

302
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,070
Don't make her suffer
any more than she has.

303
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,230
She has to fight alone,
so the most painful thing for her

304
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,180
is having people who
call her their friend!

305
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,670
--Get back here! Damn brat!
--How dare you steal our treasure?!

306
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,900
Stealing from pirates?!

307
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,190
Yeah!

308
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,110
I'm using the huge number of
pirates in this era to my advantage!

309
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,410
It's like, "You get what you deserve!"

310
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,750
You're covered in cuts, though!

311
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,050
Yeah. I sorta screwed up.

312
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,120
But look at this! One million Berries!

313
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,360
Forget that! You need
medical treatment, quick!

314
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,290
I'm fine! It's nothing!

315
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,240
No one will ever find it here!

316
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,170
I'll gather money little by little,

317
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,690
and it'll be 100 million
when I'm grown up!

318
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,340
I have a long ways to go...

319
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,130
100 million Berries...

320
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,600
It's taken a long time,
but just seven million left...

321
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,400
I can earn that much now in one try!

322
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,970
Just one more journey,
and it'll all be over...

323
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,190
Everyone in Cocoyashi Village
and I will be free of Arlong.

324
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,580
And then...

325
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,140
And then, I think I can finally
smile from the bottom of my heart...

326
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,560
Bellemere-san...

327
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,890
What does the navy want with Nami?

328
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,060
You simply need to lead the way quietly.

329
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,750
Why does that old guy have
a pinwheel on his head?

330
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,700
So cool!

331
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,900
Guess I'll get started on
my final act of plundering!

332
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,420
The navy?!

333
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,530
And why is Gen-san with them?

334
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,920
Are you the girl thief known as Nami?

335
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,670
Our information has it you've hidden
treasure you stole from pirates

336
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,550
in this tangerine orchard.

337
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,970
They were pirates, though.

338
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,380
I have no intentions
of condemning you.

339
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,620
However, stealing is stealing.

340
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,670
Therefore, as of this moment,
all of the property you've stolen

341
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,100
now belongs to the government!

342
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,700
Now give us all of your stolen goods!

343
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,040
We're confiscating it!

344
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

345
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

346
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

347
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

348
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

349
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

350
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

351
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

352
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

353
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

354
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

355
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,480
Alright! Now we know
all about this island!

356
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,740
Let's hurry and meet up with Luffy!

357
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,010
Yeah.

358
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,980
What're you doing?

359
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Appreciating happiness.

360
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,790
I can stop Nami-san's suffering
with my own two hands!

361
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,020
Hey, Nami! What's wrong?!

362
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,990
You're still here?!
Just leave the island already!

363
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,220
On the next episode of One Piece!

364
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,190
"Luffy Rises!
Result of the Broken Promise!"

365
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
