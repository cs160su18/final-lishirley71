2
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,100
God's Island, Upper Yard...

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,190
In the ruins that spread around Giant Jack,

20
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,600
men clashed against one another.

21
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,900
Eisen Whip!

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,820
As this fierce battle for survival rages on,

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,830
Laki, a female Shandian warrior,
falls at the hands of God Eneru.

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,510
Laki!!

25
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,710
Meanwhile, Nami, Gan Fall and Aisa,
who were swallowed by the giant snake,

26
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,330
met someone they never
expected to see in its stomach.

27
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,040
"Bursting Slash! Zoro vs. Ohm!!"

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,730
Dammit! The one I have to beat first is...!

29
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,450
Did it work?!

30
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,160
Seems like it wasn't enough!
Then I'll just keep trying!

31
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,970
Damn! That extendable sword
this priest uses is a pain!

32
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,640
When that snake is the
one I have to beat first!

33
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,030
I have to get Nami and the
weird knight out right away.

34
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,780
Well, they were swallowed whole,
so they probably didn't die outright.

35
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,850
But it's just a matter
of time before they do.

36
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,440
Eisen Whip!

37
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,880
Another one!

38
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,210
That bastard... Where is he?!

39
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:15,890
Eisen Whip!

40
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,980
You can't escape my attacks...

41
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,220
...just as no one can ever
escape the reality of death.

42
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,480
Just accept your destiny.

43
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,310
But I guess I'm just wasting my breath,

44
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,500
since you probably don't have enough
sense to realize you're about to die.

45
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,140
Realize your foolishness!

46
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,290
You're a small being who is very anxious
about the gold before your eyes,

47
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,840
and cannot see your inalterable fate.

48
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,770
How sad...

49
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,230
Where is he? Where the heck is he?

50
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,100
Where will he attack from next?

51
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,620
Eisen Whip!

52
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,990
What's going on?!
Why does he know where I am?!

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,390
It's as if he can see
me from behind the wall!

54
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,880
Just what is that horn-shaped
sunglass-wearing freak?!

55
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,130
Die, Blue Sea person!

56
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,140
I have no business with you!

57
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,640
Another voice has disappeared.

58
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,560
The survivors in the Upper Ruins are now...

59
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,360
...five people... and two animals.

60
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,340
No...

61
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,070
Eisen Whip!

62
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,630
Prepare yourself, Ohm!

63
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,900
It's four people and two animals.

64
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,040
Two-Sword Style...

65
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,100
...Hawk...

66
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,630
Eisen Back!

67
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,430
...Wave!

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Wh-What?! An iron wall!

69
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,090
This sword is Iron Clouds!

70
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,790
You think clouds have a set shape?

71
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
You son of a...!

72
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,990
Eisen Fan!

73
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,820
Eisen Fork!

74
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,740
Eisen Fleuret!

75
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,740
This isn't good! I can't
avoid it! Why is that?!

76
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,130
He's reading my movements!

77
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,900
What's the matter?!

78
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,010
You depend on your swords,
so keeping a distance does you no good.

79
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,830
Not quite!

80
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,100
Thirty-six Caliber Phoenix!

81
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,230
Eisen Whip!

82
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,130
It's gonna be repelled!

83
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,160
Dammit!

84
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,140
That's quite an interesting
technique, Blue Sea person!

85
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,940
But are you going to try that again?

86
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,810
Even if you lose sight of me,
I can know exactly where you are...

87
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,810
...by using Mantra.

88
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,630
Sh-Shandian warriors aren't
intimidated by a mere dog!

89
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,290
Another one disappeared...

90
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,580
Now there're three people
and two animals left...

91
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,620
...although it'll soon be
two people and two animals.

92
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,720
It seems that you're the axis
of the Blue Sea people group.

93
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,850
You and your comrades all fought well.

94
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,740
However, I've already
taken aim at your heart.

95
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,310
Pray to God, swordsman from the Blue Sea!

96
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,510
You fool! I'll never pray to God!

97
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,720
How sad...

98
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,910
The difference among people
is if they die sooner or later.

99
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,040
Just do want you want.

100
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,820
I've had enough of your arrogant lecture!

101
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,360
Although I can't see you,

102
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,710
that extendable sword of yours
will tell me where you are!

103
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,470
Hmph! The moment you find out
will be the moment you die!

104
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
The past held 36 worldly desires.

105
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,690
The present holds 72 worldly desires.

106
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,300
The future will hold 108 worldly desires!

107
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,100
Three-Sword Style!
One-hundred-eight Caliber Phoenix!

108
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,880
The iron clouds were repelled!

109
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,540
Eww! Eww! Eww! Eww!

110
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,730
A dead end!!

111
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,850
Gum-Gum... Balloon!!

112
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
Man... This mystery cave is a horrible cave!

113
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,270
Like I said, this isn't a cave!
We're inside the snake's stomach!

114
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,830
Oh, Nami, you're okay...

115
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,280
Nami!!

116
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,260
Hey, Nami! Hang in there! Nami!

117
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,270
I'm over here!

118
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,450
Let me go! Are you gonna
squeeze me to death?!

119
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,000
So you're okay...

120
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,120
Wh-What're you doing, Aisa?!

121
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,040
He's our enemy! An enemy who
took away the Shandians' homeland!

122
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,730
I'll take his head!

123
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,220
What's the point of taking the
head of the weird knight here?!

124
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,420
Before Eneru showed up, he was
the leader of the Skypieans!

125
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,920
The Skypieans, who drove us
Shandians out of our homeland!

126
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,380
That was 400 long years ago, right?

127
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,680
It wasn't him who did it.

128
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,440
If your people would be satisfied by
taking my head, I'd gladly give it to you.

129
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,470
But the way things are now, taking my
head alone wouldn't settle things,

130
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,960
as the hostility between the Shandians
and Skypieans does not change at all.

131
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,070
Our ancestors took your homeland
away from you, Shandians.

132
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,960
I cannot find a way to
apologize for that action.

133
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:06,060
Time passes by while I
continue to remain helpless.

134
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,610
I am powerless.

135
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,290
If possible, I would like
to apologize one by one

136
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:19,840
"Knight"

137
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,970
to all Shandians who died in seeking
their homeland in the past 400 years.

138
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,360
I am sincerely sorry.

139
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,360
The weird knight has been trying very hard
so that everyone that lives in the sky

140
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,530
can get along and live peacefully.

141
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,060
And yet, if you...

142
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,420
We can't get along and live peacefully!

143
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,120
With bad guys!

144
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,600
They're not bad guys!

145
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,420
What's bad is when one race
refuses to coexist with another!

146
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,600
Am I wrong?!

147
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,060
Aisa!!

148
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,330
Wh-Why did you stop me?! You idiot!

149
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,540
He's apologizing, so there's no
need to take his life, is there?

150
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,960
The city of gold, Shandora...

151
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,390
The golden bell that must've been in the
center of the city isn't here any longer...

152
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,720
The belfry for that bell might've
had Poneglyphs engraved on it.

153
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,250
If this city fell in order to protect
the Poneglyphs, as I suspect,

154
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,090
it should still be hidden
somewhere even now...

155
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,170
The belfry with the
Poneglyphs engraved on it...

156
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,390
If that's the case, where could it be?

157
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,380
Oh? This is... a rail for lorries.

158
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,430
Something was taken out from here.

159
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,920
It's still new... I wonder
what was taken out.

160
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,800
Isn't it amazing? Even after
being shot up to the sky,

161
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,680
this city, Shandora,
still majestically exists like this.

162
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,650
Even if it's a legendary city,
if it's covered by clouds,

163
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,700
it can't even show off its figure.

164
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm the one who found it.

165
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,850
Those stupid former Gods
didn't even notice this city.

166
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,350
Who're you?

167
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,270
God...

168
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
You're pretty good.

169
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,100
It seems like you're an
archaeologist from the Blue Sea.

170
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,920
It took even us several
months to find these ruins.

171
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,210
If you can read the letters on the ruins,
you can find this place that easily?

172
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,280
However, the gold you're
looking for isn't here any longer.

173
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,880
You're a few years late.

174
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,140
Gold?

175
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,710
Come to think of it, I can't find any.
It must be you who took it out from here.

176
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,330
Gold is a nice thing.

177
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,830
That glittering metal suits me well.

178
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,720
Then, you took the golden bell
that used to be here, too?

179
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
Golden bell?

180
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,680
He doesn't know?!

181
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:08,200
That's interesting. What did you
learn by reading the letters?

182
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,280
No... Unfortunately, if it wasn't
here when you first came here,

183
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,820
it didn't come to the sky after all.

184
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,820
The huge golden bell that
Shandora took pride in,

185
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,810
and the large belfry for that bell...

186
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,930
I needed to see the belfry.

187
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,890
No, wait... Yes! It's here.
It's here in the sky!

188
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,250
When this island was blown
into the sky 400 years ago...

189
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,940
in other words, on the day that
God's Island, Upper Yard, was born,

190
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,800
it's said that the loud chimes of a bell
rang throughout the entire nation...

191
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,150
...although old people in this nation
call it the island's singing voice.

192
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:11,250
I see! That bell was made of gold! Wonderful!

193
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,870
Soon the game will be over.
Eight more minutes to go.

194
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:24,380
While I'm at it, why don't I
look for... the golden bell?

195
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,990
The golden bell is in the sky?
Then... Poneglyphs, too?

196
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,840
Looks like there's a maggot
at the edge of the island.

197
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,760
What?

198
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,020
Please hang in there, Usopp-san, Sanji-san.

199
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,290
They still haven't awoken yet?

200
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,190
But... But they'll definitely
get well, Father.

201
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,650
They sure will. There's no way that
such kind people won't get better.

202
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,050
Conis-san...

203
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,340
My wish is that,
when the sky becomes peaceful,

204
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,660
I'd like to once again show everyone
hospitality to my heart's content...

205
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,550
...including you.

206
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,200
Father...

207
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,670
What's the matter, Suu?!
Is it time for your meal?

208
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,230
Suu, what's wrong? Are you in pain?

209
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,190
C-Could it be that you're...?

210
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,990
I'm one of those who fought
with Gan Fall-sama six years ago.

211
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,420
Then, as I thought, you're a
member of the Divine Squad!

212
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,450
In a closed-off area, we were...

213
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,800
What on earth happened?

214
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,040
Conis-san, attend to him right away!

215
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,220
Yes, Father!

216
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,060
Wait!

217
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,670
My wife and children are on Angel Island!

218
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,310
Yes, everyone's worried about you all.

219
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,520
Please let everyone know!
Eneru is planning to return everything!

220
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,650
What?

221
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,510
Skypiea will be dropped to the Blue Sea!

222
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,500
This nation will disappear!!

223
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,710
Th-That can't be...

224
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,870
There's no time to lose!
Tell them right away! Eneru is...

225
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,710
...planning to eliminate
everyone living in the sky!!

226
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,870
Eliminate everyone from the sky?

227
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,440
W-Wait a second, please!
If he does such a thing,

228
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,950
there won't be a place
even for God Eneru himself.

229
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,620
He's got an ark! "Ark Maxim"!

230
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,860
Ark... Maxim?

231
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,010
What're you...?!

232
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,040
What?!

233
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,260
We were forced to spend the last
six years building that flying ship!

234
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,060
My wish is that,
when the sky becomes peaceful,

235
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,920
I'd like to once again show everyone
hospitality to my heart's content...

236
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
...including you.

237
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,870
Father!!

238
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,880
Racing full speed ahead as always

239
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,630
A to Z, we run through it

240
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,430
We all have worries and fall many times

241
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,350
But we just need to rise to the top someday

242
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:31,820
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

243
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:39,880
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

244
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,380
I never treat you "bad"

245
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,080
How many times did we fall?

246
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:55,170
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

247
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,710
Smile! Come back to you, friends

248
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,520
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

249
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,440
Come back to you, friends

250
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,280
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

251
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,980
Come back to you, friends

252
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,540
Let's break out!

253
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,460
The time is approaching.
I'll put an end to the survival game.

254
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,340
Whoa! The ground broke into pieces!

255
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,170
Is this our homeland, the one we've
been fighting for for 400 years?!

256
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,010
Well, it seems there's an extra person.

257
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,720
So you die!

258
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,240
On the next episode of One Piece!

259
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,770
"Collapsing Upper Ruins!
The Quintet for the Finale!"

260
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
