00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

We can't wait until the morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

yume no kakera hitotsu ni

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,210
Put the pieces of our dreams together

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel something - that's the treasure

Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,460
We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41

and become the King of the Pirates!

Tomorrow and the day after,

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,760
there will be a chain of burning, intense excitement!

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,680
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,810
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,810
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,130
Usopp knocked Sugar out

77
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,740
and freed the toys who had been forced to labor as slaves

78
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,540
but Doflamingo confined everybody in the country in the Birdcage.

79
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,980
Now, let's bring an end to everything.

80
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,700
I-It's started...!

81
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,230
The Birdcage!

82
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,550
Doflamingo is going to...

83
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,380
...kill everyone on the island!

84
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,780
"The 500 Million Berry Man!
Target: Usoland!"

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,770
Damn! It's as steady as rock!

86
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,020
Move aside!

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,040
How about this?!

88
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,610
How's that?!

89
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,500
Daddy!

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,140
Somebody! Stop me!

91
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,820
Nobody's gonna come to help.
Nobody can get out of this Birdcage.

92
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,110
Hello? Hello?!

93
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,210
You can't make contact with
anyone out there.

94
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,300
You're all going to die
and no one out there will know it.

95
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,440
--Your neighbors who are running wild...
--Don't! Daddy!

96
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,170
--...will keep harming others randomly.
--Somebody, please stop me!

97
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,610
Or I'm gonna kill my own kids!

98
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,820
It doesn't matter if it's their family or close friends

99
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,900
or citizens who they swore to protect.

100
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,330
Don't do it!

101
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,550
I can't control my body!
Somebody, please! Stop me!

102
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,460
Get away from me! Everybody!

103
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,410
Issho-san!

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,280
Even if you run or hide,

105
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,940
there is no safe place in the cage.

106
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,620
The terror of the Birdcage will go on for days.

107
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:26,660
It's a matter of which happens sooner.
You all die or you finish the game.

108
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,660
Damn that Doflamingo!
You can't anticipate his next move!

109
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,200
I can't believe it!
The factory went up and is gone now!

110
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,820
--But this is definitely a good chance for us!
--We can get out!

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,150
--We finally can get out from underground!
--Thank you, God Usopp!

112
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,200
Advance!

113
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,660
Robin-dono!

114
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,780
Kin'emon!
I'm glad that you're okay!

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,750
A-An iron breast-band?!
This is quite a foreign culture.

116
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,860
Love it!

117
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,030
R-Robin-senpai, let me be your slave!

118
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,140
I mean, can I ask you something?

119
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,260
Th-That guy's nose...

120
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,900
It looks like Sniper King-senpai's,

121
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,510
who is known for shooting out the flag on the Tower of Law!

122
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,550
It's him. His name is Usopp.

123
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,010
There he is!

124
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,160
And Robin-senpai was moved by
the action of her pirate group...

125
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,370
...that turned the world against them
in order to save one of their friends!

126
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,840
That makes them
the Enies Lobby Shoot-out Duo!

127
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,190
Yes! Yes! Oh, yes!

128
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,130
What are you excited for?! You geek!
Shut your mouth!

129
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,090
I got my arm broken by this fool?!

130
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,480
Alright, I hand them over to you.

131
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,390
Although they're little, they're quite good warriors.

132
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,540
Thank you, Topknot-land!

133
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,160
We found them passed out
in a hallway at the Palace!

134
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,960
I guess they laid their lives on the line
for the commander.

135
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,050
Cub-san! Rampo! I'm proud of you all!

136
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,840
Somebody, stop me!
My body's out of control!

137
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Somebody!

138
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,840
This is exactly like the incident
on that night 10 years ago!

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,420
Now...

140
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,640
I know!

141
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,760
On that night,
King Riku-sama was... the King Riku Army was...

142
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,890
...manipulated by...

143
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,960
...manipulated by Doflamingo!!

144
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,570
Scream! Hate! Suffer!

145
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,020
You people are innocent victims!

146
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,790
Help...

147
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,910
Stop me!

148
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,310
Stop it... Doflamingo!

149
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,980
Think!

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,720
You either come to kill me or
side with us Don Quixote Family

151
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,630
and punish the 12 fools who rebel against me.

152
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,680
If you make the wrong decision,
the game will not end.

153
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,430
I'll pay 100 million berries for each star rating!

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,880
100 million berries?!

155
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,890
These are the criminals in Dressrosa!

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,990
First, the One-stars...

157
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:22,720
REBECCA

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:46,040
VIOLA - THE FORMER PRINCESS OF DRESSROSA

161
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:53,720
CYBORG FRANKY - A PIRATE OF THE STRAW HATS

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,240
Next, the Two-stars...

163
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:06,460
KYROS - THE FORMER ARMY COMMANDER OF DRESSROSA

164
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:14,240
PIRATE HUNTER ZORO
- A PIRATE OF THE STRAW HATS

165
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,220
A-Army Commander Kyros!

166
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,940
I forgot about him, the invincible gladiator!

167
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,830
There are pirates, too! It's the Straw Hats!

168
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,370
I didn't know the executive of the Family, Violet, was Princess Viola!

169
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,210
And as for key figures of each group,

170
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,690
I give them three stars!

171
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:45,520
SABO - THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY

172
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:53,260
STRAW HAT LUFFY - A PIRATE
THE CAPTAIN OF THE STRAW HATS

173
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:01,000
TRAFALGAR LAW - THE CAPTAIN OF "THE HEART PIRATES"
THE WARLORD(TENTATIVE), "SURGEON OF DEATH"

174
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,770
RIKU DOLDO III - THE FORMER KING OF DRESSROSA

175
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,410
300 million!

176
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,780
Law and Straw Hat...
Their pirate alliance has just startled the world!

177
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,330
King Riku!

178
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,390
King Riku-sama... He was alive!

179
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,360
There's a big gun from the Revolutionary Army!
He's the Chief of Staff!

180
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,330
--They knew about you already!
--I'm a target, too?!

181
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,610
Wh-What a relief.
They haven't found out about me.

182
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:43,440
Plus, there is the man who
pissed me off the most today!

183
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,030
It's all his fault that you people have to
play such a bloody game!

184
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,260
The one who kills him will get...

185
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,060
...500 million berries!

186
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:11,740
"GOD" USOPP - A PIRATE OF THE STRAW HATS

187
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,530
500 million!

188
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,920
I don't have to work for the rest of my life!

189
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,950
Five?!!

190
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,490
F... F... Five...

191
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,400
Oh... Oh no, Usoland is...

192
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,350
The Five-star!

193
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,720
There are two One-stars
and one Three-star there!

194
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,450
Sabo-kun, what should we do?

195
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,750
Let's go above ground! Everybody, run!

196
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,830
God Usopp! I'm sorry but I need to kill you!

197
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,490
The Five-star! 500 million!

198
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,440
Th-They were worshiping me
until a few minutes ago!

199
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,240
Damn! Please run!

200
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,420
Yes, sir!

201
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,230
Robin-dono!

202
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,090
I'm gonna go look for Kanjuro so excuse me!

203
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,190
Be careful!

204
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,480
There's one, too!

205
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,250
The One-star samurai! 100 million berries!

206
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,810
This is so annoying!

207
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,280
Th-The Little Person told me
there's a junkyard down there!

208
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,720
Are you really there, Kanjuro?!

209
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,690
--100 million berries is mine!
--Okay, let's just go!

210
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,000
He fell! The samurai fell down into the hole!

211
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,390
You have no time to wonder what to do.

212
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,090
People are falling and
towns are burning moment by moment.

213
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,230
Either you kill me...

214
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,360
...or kill the 12 criminals.

215
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,790
Now the game is on!

216
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,730
What should we do?!

217
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,840
We just found out that
King Riku-sama was innocent!

218
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,060
If we citizens all act together,
maybe we can take down Doflamingo...

219
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,280
It's not just him!

220
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,750
In order to kill Doflamingo,

221
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,490
we have to fight the 2000 soldiers of the Doflamingo Family!

222
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,810
What are we supposed to do then?
Even King Riku-sama is in the 12 criminal list!

223
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,880
Are we gonna do wrong by the innocent king again?

224
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,510
I think we don't have to kill them!

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,960
We can just take them into custody!
Just 12 of them!

226
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,990
We have no choice! Let's fight!

227
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,660
--Yeah!
--You're right!

228
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,440
One of the 12 criminals is
knocked out over here.

229
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,090
What?!

230
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,170
Where did Cyborg Franky go?
He was down on the ground.

231
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,090
I'm back on my feet
with backup cola for destroying the factory!

232
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,010
Look! There's one of the Straw Hats!

233
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,360
Wait!

234
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,930
You guys are the ex-toys who were saved by Usopp, aren't you?!

235
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:04,490
It's nothing personal!
One-star, 100 million berries, Cyborg Franky!

236
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,730
100 million is mine!

237
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,420
Bring it on!

238
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,930
How dare you guys be blinded by money!

239
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,880
If you think you can bring me down, try it!

240
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,650
Silly big talkers!

241
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,790
Th-There's the criminal!

242
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,730
One of the criminals is here!

243
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,680
Let's go!

244
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,960
Catch him, everybody!

245
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,490
Forget about us and just shoot!

246
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,560
Cut it out, guys!
I have no business with you town people!

247
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,810
Shoot already!

248
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,080
Shoot!

249
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,600
I have no choice.

250
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,490
You'll have to try harder!

251
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,830
We've made up our mind!
We've got to do it!

252
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,050
There's no end if I fight them one by one!

253
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,760
This would do!

254
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,650
Usopp did his part so it's my turn!

255
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm gonna break the factory into pieces!

256
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,240
Hey hey, the factory went up on its own!

257
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,420
It's Pica.

258
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,780
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

259
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,520
Trebol!

260
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,650
--What?
--Doffy?

261
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,390
Diamante, I didn't know you are there, too.

262
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,800
Y-Yes, I am.

263
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,780
Doffy, about Sugar...

264
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,380
Both of you, come back to the Palace!

265
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,020
We'll talk later. Okay?!

266
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,870
Clank.

267
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,460
Wait!

268
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,900
Barrier!

269
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,220
Stop following us!

270
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,870
Go on! To the ground above!

271
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,750
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

272
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,330
--Zoro?
--Yeah.

273
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,550
--Where are you now?
--Robin?

274
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,950
I'm with Luffy and the others.
We're on, what they call, the King's Plateau.

275
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,510
Things are getting messy, aren't they?

276
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,500
Is this Robin?!

277
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,680
Did you see it?!
Mingo's such a jerk, isn't he?!

278
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,410
But Usopp's bit was hilarious!

279
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,050
What did you say, Luffy?!

280
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,100
Rebecca was also on the list.
I wonder if she's alright.

281
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,420
Rebecca is...

282
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,870
I'm here! Lucy?!

283
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,180
Oh! It's good that you're there!

284
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,710
The soldier is here...

285
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,460
Oh?

286
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,510
Where did the soldier go?

287
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,170
What?!

288
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,590
Don't tell me he is...

289
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,890
It's the criminal!

290
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,420
Kill him!

291
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,310
Soldier-san?! He turned back to a human, too, didn't he?!

292
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,920
Tell me, Lucy, what kind of a man is he?!

293
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
What kind of a man?!
What are you talking about?!

294
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,970
That one-legged soldier was...

295
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,310
...your father!

296
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,430
He's the old man the statue is of!

297
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,990
I... I couldn't protect her!

298
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,750
I'm sorry!

299
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,510
I couldn't protect your mother!

300
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,780
Although I couldn't protect your mother,

301
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,400
I'm gonna protect you to the end, with my life!

302
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,300
Until the day you are filled with happiness,

303
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,070
I will always be by your side!

304
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,320
I thought so...

305
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,050
Run, Rebecca!

306
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm gonna save you now, Rebecca!

307
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,740
Soldier-san is a brave man

308
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,130
He will always be by your side

309
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,770
Happy Birthday, Rebecca!

310
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,970
Let me teach you how to fight.

311
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,340
There's no need since I have you.

312
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm gonna teach you how to not get hurt!

313
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,740
Humans' instincts are much better than that!

314
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,190
Let it all out!

315
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,220
Believe in your human power!

316
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm a toy.

317
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,060
I don't know how long my body's gonna last!

318
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,410
Stand up, Rebecca!

319
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,450
Be strong!

320
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,830
I'm happy for you!

321
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,490
The soldier guy has gone somewhere now
but listen to me, Rebecca!

322
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,420
Don't cry yet!

323
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,700
I won't let the soldier die!
You have to be safe, too!

324
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,910
I feel bad that I couldn't let you have
the Flare-Flare Fruit that you wanted.

325
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,610
But instead,

326
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,950
I promise I'll kick Doflamingo's ass for you!

327
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,680
So stay with my friends!

328
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,890
I'm gonna bring an end to
this stupid game in no time!

329
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,670
So survive! Okay?!

330
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,410
Uh-huh!

331
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,950
Wait for me, Mingo!

332
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,500
Along with Law and Zoro, Luffy is on the move!

333
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,870
The three single-mindedly make a dash
for the Royal Palace to confront Doflamingo,

334
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,210
but are surrounded by executives of the Family -
Machvise, Señor, Dellinger,

335
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,610
and rowdy pirates who are looking to
claim their prize,

336
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,300
and find themselves caught in a deadly battle!

337
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,920
On the next episode of One Piece!

338
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,150
"Breaking through Enemy Lines!
Luffy and Zoro Launch the Counter-Attack!"

339
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,290
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
