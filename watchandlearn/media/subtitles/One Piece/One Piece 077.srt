00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,310
That was hot! Couldn't you
have done it a different way?

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,640
Well, then. Can you tell
which is the real one?

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,280
Gum-Gum Stamp!

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,190
How... did you know... I was here?

25
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,740
A hunch.

26
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,940
"Farewell, Giant Island!
Head for Alabasta"

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,930
Whoa! Look behind him!

28
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,990
A rainbow! There's a rainbow!

29
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,950
Even the way he cries is big!

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,030
It's practically a waterfall!

31
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,130
I understand how you feel, Master Broggy!

32
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,940
Dorry! How are you...

33
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,350
It seems I blacked out...

34
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,970
Mr. 0?

35
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,170
Wasn't Mr. 0 the name of the
enemy boss Vivi-chan talked about?

36
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,130
Which means the guy on the other
end of this Transponder Snail...

37
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,200
...is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea?!

38
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,070
It's been many days since
I issued your orders.

39
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,100
What's going on?

40
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,020
Mr. 3... So he's the owner
of this Transponder Snail?

41
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,980
Ah. I think I got it figured out now.

42
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,680
This is an enemy hideout,

43
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,930
and a guy named Mr. 3 came to
the island to take Vivi-chan's life...

44
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,140
Damn... This was no time
for me to be hunting!

45
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,410
I hope they're all okay!

46
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,230
Why the silent treatment?

47
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,000
I asked you a question.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Have you eliminated Princess
Vivi and the Straw Hats?!

49
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,700
Yeah, mission complete!

50
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,380
I got rid of everyone who
found out about your secret.

51
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,780
So there's no need to
go after 'em anymore.

52
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,900
I see. Well done.

53
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,920
As we speak, the Unluckies
are headed your way

54
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,850
to confirm your mission is complete
and to deliver a certain package.

55
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,690
Unluckies? Package?

56
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,570
An Eternal Pose that points
to the Alabasta Kingdom.

57
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:26,830
You and Ms. Golden Week will head
to Alabasta. The time has come.

58
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,210
We're about to begin our
most important operation.

59
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,830
Details will come after you reach
Alabasta. Wait for my orders.

60
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,210
What are these things?!

61
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,220
Hey. What's going on?

62
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,770
Oh, it's nothing...

63
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,180
What the hell?!

64
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,190
You tryin' to kill me?!
Bring it on, you damn monkey!

65
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,810
I'm telling you...

66
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,720
...to stop that!

67
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,020
You jumbo-sized chicken!

68
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,380
What was that?! What happened?!

69
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,460
Oh, uhh, no! It ain't--
I mean, it's nothing!

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,230
That damn Straw Hat was still alive.

71
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,120
It's okay, though. I finished him off.

72
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,910
No need to worry.

73
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,360
Still alive?

74
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,340
You just said your mission
was complete... Did you not?

75
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,560
Yes, well...
I thought it was complete...

76
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,780
But he was much tougher
than you'd believe...

77
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,070
In other words... the report
you gave me was a lie.

78
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,380
Umm, well... I suppose so,
when you put it that way...

79
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,540
But I've gotten rid of him for sure now.

80
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,280
So there's no need to send
any more after 'em. Okay?

81
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,160
Very well.

82
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,270
Just head straight to
Alabasta from there now!

83
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,970
It's probably... because of the weapons...

84
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,320
Weapons?! Oh, yeah!

85
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,020
Not even Elbaf weapons could
keep up with two giants

86
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,310
fighting to the death
for 100 years straight!

87
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,430
Talk about crazy...

88
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,550
It's a huge miracle!

89
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Hey, Broggy! Don't hold on to me!
That hurts my wounds!

90
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,510
I'm so glad you're alive, friend of mine!

91
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,080
Miracle, my ass. It's only natural.

92
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,850
The fact those weapons are
still intact after 100 years

93
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,360
of constant bashing and
clanging is even crazier.

94
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,890
As are their owners.

95
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,400
What a wonderful day today is!
I thank you, God of Elbaf!

96
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh, Broggy?

97
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,250
Was chopping me down and
knocking me out that happy for you?

98
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,880
You dimwit! That ain't what I'm saying!

99
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,140
Oww! Don't touch my wounds!

100
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,710
You want some of this?!

101
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,900
Yeah! I'll wipe the floor with ya!

102
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,070
Cool! Cool! Cool!

103
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,570
Why are you guys fighting again?!

104
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,950
...And no further
radio contact from now on.

105
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,520
We don't want the Navy
catching whiff of us.

106
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,490
All further orders will be
sent via letter, as usual.

107
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,270
That is all. Good luck, Mr. 3.

108
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,680
Miss All Sunday.

109
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,520
Yes?

110
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,980
Send Mr. 2 to Little Garden.

111
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:01,260
Eliminate Mr. 3 on his direct course
to Alabasta from Little Garden.

112
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,780
That's quite aggressive,
Mr. 0, Crocodile, sir.

113
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,650
We have enough manpower as it is.
Are you arguing with me?

114
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,820
No, I'll do as you wish.
I'll make arrangements at once.

115
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,500
Well, he's hung up. So let's see...

116
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,930
What were these guys, anyway?!

117
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,290
What do we have here?

118
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,880
We had completely forgotten
about the bounties on our heads!

119
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,860
But I was the reason they came to
this island in the first place...

120
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,880
Oww!

121
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
Let's have none of that!

122
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,010
Yeah, Vivi! What're you
so down in the dumps for?

123
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,150
Want a rice cracker?

124
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,320
Hey! Where did you get those?

125
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,340
Alright! For now,
let's have a rice cracker party!

126
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,820
Rice crackers aren't very exciting.

127
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,580
Really? We can even make
toasts with them!

128
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,530
See? Does anyone blame you?

129
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,680
Cheers!

130
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,030
C'mon! Don't do that!

131
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,640
Geez! You can't just waste food like that!

132
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,850
What're you doing?! Give it here!
Who said you could have mine?!

133
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,700
Give it! It's mine!

134
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,430
Who says?!

135
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,930
What's wrong?

136
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,880
Nothing. Just a bug.

137
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,530
Still, waiting a year for the
Log to point to the next island

138
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,770
is pretty serious stuff...

139
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,710
Yeah! It's definitely no laughing matter!

140
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,120
You saved us. We would like
to thank you in some way...

141
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,080
Oh, in that case, you old guys
can do something about our Log!

142
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm afraid Logs are the only
thing we can't help you with...

143
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,530
Nami-san! Vivi-chan!
And you other bums!

144
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,390
Hey! Sanji!

145
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,030
You're okay! Thank goodness!

146
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,430
That jerk suddenly shows up
only after we needed help!

147
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,920
What in the hell?! Are you Mr. 3?!

148
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,480
Hey! How do you know about Mr. 3?

149
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,410
Nami-san!

150
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,020
You're so titillating!

151
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,110
Feel like getting slugged?

152
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,930
Now, now, Nami-san.
You'll catch cold dressed like that.

153
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,770
Here you are.

154
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,440
Thanks.

155
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,420
All that aside, I just finished talking
with Mr. 0 via Transponder Snail.

156
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,640
You talked to the boss?!

157
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,300
Yeah. I found this weird
hideout in the jungle, you see.

158
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,890
He seemed to think I was Mr. 3,
so I told him I eliminated everyone.

159
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,350
So that means he thinks we're dead?!

160
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,350
So we're finally free of people
chasing us, but we can't go anywhere!

161
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,450
Can't go anywhere? Do we still
have business on this island?

162
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,660
Just after I managed
to get ahold of this, too...

163
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,880
Eh? What?

164
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,210
It's an Eternal Pose to Alabasta!

165
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,410
Hurray!

166
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,470
Now we can set sail!

167
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,510
Hurray! Way to go, Sanji-kun!

168
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,270
Thank you, Sanji-san!

169
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,970
I was so worried for a moment there!

170
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,430
No, no! It was my pleasure!
I'm glad I could make you so happy!

171
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,760
Alright, everyone!
Let's have a rice cracker party!

172
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,600
Oh no, Luffy!

173
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,220
We only have three left!
We can't have a rice cracker party!

174
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,740
What?!

175
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,300
You know this is no time for that!

176
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,460
Let's go, Captain! We don't
have time to be lounging around!

177
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,740
Oh, yeah! Hey, you.

178
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,710
You haven't forgotten
our hunting contest, I hope!

179
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,920
Nope! But I win!
I caught a rhino this huge!

180
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,590
A rhino? I assume you can eat that?!

181
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,930
Of course!

182
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,900
Hunting contest?

183
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,860
Hunting contest?

184
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,820
Those words sound familiar somehow...

185
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,930
Yes...

186
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,170
Alright, round old guy and giant old guy!

187
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,270
We're gonna go now!

188
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,250
Oh, I see. Well, you do
seem to be in a hurry.

189
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,320
That's too bad, but we won't stop you.
I hope your homeland is okay.

190
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,300
Yes! Thank you!

191
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,160
See ya! Don't die anymore!

192
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,750
Master! I will visit Elbaf someday!

193
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,160
You'll see. Mine's way bigger than yours.

194
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,220
You wish!

195
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm gonna be a brave warrior of the sea!

196
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,930
Our friends are setting sail.

197
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,310
Yes. We can't just sit here.
There's a monster in the western sea.

198
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,570
Dorry! How are your wounds?

199
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,750
These? They won't kill me.

200
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,170
This axe and that sword
are just about done with.

201
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,590
Do you have regrets?

202
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,140
I do. This axe fought alongside
me for over 100 years.

203
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,500
But, if it's for them, it's worth it!

204
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,500
Then it's decided...

205
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,480
See?! Mine's far huger than yours!

206
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,100
Look closer! My lizard's bigger!

207
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,110
Are you blind or something?!
My rhino's way bigger!

208
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,980
It doesn't really matter!
They both look yummy!

209
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,530
You shut up!

210
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:30,980
Huh?

211
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,740
Look! Mine's bigger!

212
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,420
No, mine is!

213
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,470
How long are you gonna keep at that?

214
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,750
We don't need all of it, so cut up
what we do need so we can set sail!

215
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,430
Yes, Nami-san!

216
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,310
Hey, Usopp!
I'm clearly the winner, right?!

217
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,920
I don't really care.

218
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,390
Can't you call it a tie?

219
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,810
There are no ties in a challenge!

220
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,390
Hurry it up!

221
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,810
Right!

222
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,070
Set sail!

223
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,940
They said going straight will take us
to the western end of the island.

224
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,960
Hey. Couldn't you have gotten
any more meat on board?

225
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,870
Yeah, right! Don't be stupid!
We can't preserve any more than that.

226
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,840
Do you want to sink the ship?!

227
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,790
Look, it's the old guys!
They came to see us off!

228
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,790
Ahead is a great obstacle...

229
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,730
...that prevents people who come to
this island from reaching the next...

230
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,050
You fought desperately
to protect our pride.

231
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,330
As such, no matter what manner
of enemy there may be...

232
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,880
...we will not let them
destroy your pride, friends!

233
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,760
Have faith in us,
and continue straight ahead!

234
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,100
Straight ahead, no matter what happens!

235
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,000
Got it!

236
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,220
What's this about?

237
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,470
What do you got?

238
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,430
We'll go straight ahead, no matter what!

239
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,590
This is goodbye!

240
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,320
Let's meet again someday.

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,410
Without fail.

242
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,770
Look! Up ahead!

243
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,230
There you are, Island-Eater!

244
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,180
You will open the path,
in the name of Elbaf!

245
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,950
Wha...

246
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,380
Something's appeared!

247
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,290
What's this guy? A goldfish?

248
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,260
A g-giant goldfish?!
W-Why does that sound familiar?!

249
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,180
Work the rudder! Hurry!
We're gonna get eaten!

250
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,650
Hurry, Usopp!

251
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,230
I-I can't!

252
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,090
Go straight ahead! R-Right, Luffy?!

253
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,440
Yeah! Of course!

254
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,610
Don't be stupid! This won't be
like what happened with Laboon!

255
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,750
I know. Calm down. Here, I'll let
you have the last rice cracker.

256
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,960
I don't want it! If we don't
turn the ship, we're gonna be--

257
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,770
Just give it up, Nami.

258
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,520
Luffy! We can trust those guys, I hope?!

259
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,020
Yeah!

260
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,520
Are you crazy?! Are we really
going straight into that beast?!

261
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,480
No! We're too late now!

262
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,940
You've grown a lot, Island-Eater!
You filthy monster goldfish!

263
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,620
His size isn't his only surprise.

264
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,580
There's also the size and
length of the dung he produces

265
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,580
after devouring any islands nearby.

266
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,500
I recall a giant piece of dung
named Nothing At All Island...

267
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,860
And that we landed on it long ago,
thinking it was actual land!

268
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,340
This is a nostalgic day of adventure!

269
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,300
As I look at them,
I'm reminded of the old days!

270
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,490
The only thing we can't penetrate
is the bloodstained snake!

271
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,820
Observe, the most powerful Giant spear,
as passed down in Elbaf!

272
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,610
Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

273
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,450
What are you talking about?!
We've already been eaten!

274
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,790
Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

275
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,580
Hakoku Sovereignty!

276
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

277
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

278
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

279
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

280
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,420
So even...

281
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,630
...if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

282
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,840
the ship will continue forward

283
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,940
Bon voyage!

284
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget about them!

285
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,950
I know I'm a fool, but I gotta go

286
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,620
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

287
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,290
I know I'm a fool, but I'm gonna fight

288
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,300
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

289
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,570
Do everything you can, and you'll
get a little nearer to any horizon

290
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm tired for some reason...

291
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,180
Eh? Are you all right?

292
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,290
Everyone come here!
Nami-san has a terrible fever!

293
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,370
Is Nami-san gonna die?

294
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,890
Let's find an island
with a doctor right away!

295
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,620
Don't we need to hurry to Alabasta?

296
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,500
Curing Nami-san's illness comes first!

297
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,190
Well said, Vivi-chan!

298
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,970
What's that?!

299
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,560
Do you see a doctor?

300
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,900
On the next episode of One Piece!

301
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,070
"Nami's Sick?
Beyond the Snow Falling on the Sea!"

302
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,590
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
