00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:19,050
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,370
The feelings of those who are in anguish

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,710
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,950
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

25
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,740
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

26
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,670
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,590
Though injured head-to-toe,
Karoo picks up Vivi,

28
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,210
and they escape from an attacking Mr. 2,

29
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,970
and run off between the battling
rebel army and royal army,

30
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,250
toward Alubarna Palace.

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,330
However, Karoo falls after
being hit by a stray bullet.

32
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,270
Mr. 2 closes in. Just then,
the supersonic duck squadron

33
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,500
and Sanji appear, to rescue
them from their predicament.

34
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,490
Meanwhile, at the southeast gate,

35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,190
the battle between Chopper and Usopp,

36
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,590
and Miss Merry Christmas
and Mr. 4, had begun.

37
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,310
"Sworn on a Friend's Dream!
The Battle of Molehill, Block 4"

38
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,870
They're over there?!

39
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,320
When did you have time to move?!

40
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,770
That form...! I get it,
you're a Zoan type, are you?

41
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,260
I thought you weren't just a normal person.

42
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,390
Are you okay, Usopp?

43
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,210
Thanks... you saved me...

44
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,300
So what if he did? Our advantage
over you hasn't changed a bit!

45
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,600
Let's go, Mr. 4!

46
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,720
Here we go! Off we go! Now we go!
You lunkhead! You l'ead!

47
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,650
She went underground again!

48
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,660
Usopp, you'd best consider yourself
done for if you stop moving.

49
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,250
I get you. You mean, if we stop,
they'll fire dozens more at us, huh?

50
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,210
Here they come!

51
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,020
If I can just knock you flying...!

52
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,160
Wait up. If we don't have a batter,
the game won't be any fun, will it?

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,070
Chopper!

54
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,550
Whew, I can do that.

55
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,750
Why, you dirty mole!

56
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,660
You bastard!

57
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,770
Damn. If they keep running
away through these mole holes,

58
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,030
then even if I use a Rumble Ball,
time will run out on it right away.

59
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,460
Huh?

60
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,090
Huh...?

61
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,660
Eh? Just where did that guy
with the long nose disappear to?

62
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,990
They're right. Usopp is gone!

63
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,690
I should warn you guys...!

64
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,000
My goodness, I'm impressed
you could create all of these

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,340
underground tunnels without it
becoming tiresome. Good work!

66
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,320
Then again, there can
be some literal "pitfalls"

67
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,780
when it comes to fighting
like this, you know?

68
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,550
Where are you?! Where did you go?!

69
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,300
He wouldn't...!

70
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,220
Yes!

71
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,680
You took the trouble to make
these underground tunnels.

72
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,260
You're not the only ones...

73
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,470
...who can move around in them.

74
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,340
Usopp...

75
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,100
You bastard! You were in one of the holes?!

76
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,280
...Pound!!

77
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,700
Mr. 4!

78
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,990
A f-five ton hammer?!

79
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,480
Where does that kid keep
that kind of power?!

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,920
Five tons...!

81
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,220
Who are you?

82
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,170
Traveler of the world's oceans,

83
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,340
crusher of notorious foes as I go,

84
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,950
and sinker of countless ships.

85
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,200
Out of fear, people call me
the "Dynast of Destruction."

86
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,110
Remember my name well.

87
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,120
Captain Usopp!

88
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,630
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

89
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,300
That was awesome, Usopp!

90
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,550
Yeah, thank you, thank you, baby!

91
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,030
Awesome! Awesome!

92
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,900
Thank you. I'll be signing autographs later.

93
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,850
I've underestimated
your ability up until now!

94
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,540
Hey...

95
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,320
Mr. 4 is...

96
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,850
He's not moving.
C-Could I have hit him that hard?

97
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,270
No, hold on. Either way,
this is my chance, huh?

98
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,610
You, too, penguin!

99
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,570
Take this five-ton hammer!

100
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,570
Usopp Pound!!

101
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,460
Tch, she got away! Where are you, penguin?!

102
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,890
I told you, I'm a mole, you "ba"!

103
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,390
There you are!

104
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,340
Pound!! Pound!! Pound!! Pound!! Pound!!

105
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,970
Pound!! Pound!! Pound!! Pound!!

106
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,770
Pound!! Pound!! Pound!! Pound!! Pound!!

107
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,510
Pound!! Pound!! Pound!! Pound!!

108
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,510
Rubber band!

109
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,880
Pound!! Pound!! Pound!!
Pound!! Pound!! Pound!!

110
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,280
Damn, you're all over the place...!

111
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,150
Ha! "Ba"! You "ba"! What's the point...

112
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,350
...if you can't hit me?!

113
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,200
Let me inform you of something...

114
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,970
You must have heard that a good number

115
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,890
of Baroque Works staff have
been eliminated by us, right?

116
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,210
The truth is, that was all my doing!

117
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,640
W-What?!

118
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,900
And what's more...

119
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,380
I have 8,000 men under me!

120
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,130
Really?!

121
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,300
Five tons! Five tons!

122
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,700
Wow, awesome! Wow, awesome!

123
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,770
Five tons! Five tons!

124
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,110
Wow! Awesome!

125
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,490
Five tons! Five tons!

126
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,530
Wow! Awesome--!

127
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,930
Ee-yow...!

128
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,430
What, just now?!

129
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,270
Whoa! He took a five-ton hammer,
too! He's a monster!

130
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,330
He doesn't have the
slightest bump, does he?

131
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,610
He took a direct blow to the
head by a five-ton hammer,

132
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,050
and he's uninjured?

133
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,510
Papier-mâché?! Hey, that was fake?!

134
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,940
Of course it was! You think
I can carry five tons?!

135
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,190
I have to give up after 5 kg!

136
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,170
This is a light, folding model I made
out of frying pans and a stick!

137
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,820
Why, you... You tricked me, didn't you?

138
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,290
No more mercy!

139
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,780
Mole art of escaping!

140
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,530
Mole-fish!!

141
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,730
She's gone into the molehill again!

142
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,920
Watch out for the holes!

143
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,610
W-What's she planning to do this time?

144
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,420
Where are you, you bastard?!
Where did you go?!

145
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,280
Watch out for the holes, you say?

146
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,020
That won't do any good.

147
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,690
Under the ground is like
a swimming pool to me!

148
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,000
A pool?

149
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,970
You mean...?

150
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,870
Mole...

151
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,760
Usopp!

152
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,140
...Banana!!

153
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:15,400
Mr. 4! Lassoo! You guys take
care of the reindeer man!

154
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,850
Show off your 400-swing punk knocks!

155
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,940
It's no use! I can't take
an attack like this anymore!

156
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,340
It's all or nothing!
I'll have to use these three minutes

157
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,420
to think up a way to beat this guy!

158
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,940
Rumble!!

159
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,990
Brain Point!!

160
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,380
Scope!!

161
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:42,400
Koza, where are you now?

162
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,850
Remember, the people are the country.

163
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,900
Father...

164
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,270
You still have a rebellion
to stop, right, Vivi-chan?

165
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,100
You want it so nobody dies in this fight.

166
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,970
Don't you think that's too soft-hearted?

167
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,120
People die.

168
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,050
Stop talking like that!

169
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,670
If you are the one and only hope
for preventing the rebellion,

170
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,660
then you have to survive, no matter what.

171
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,340
No matter what might
happen to any of us here.

172
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,870
You guys go on ahead!

173
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,050
We'll be waiting for you in Alubarna, okay?!

174
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,770
Yeah!

175
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,060
It will be...

176
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,000
...this pathetic little kingdom that dies.

177
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll stop this! No matter what I have to do!

178
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,250
Chopper...?

179
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,380
Chopper...

180
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,140
Is this the time for you to be
concerned about someone else?

181
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,350
I told you, no more mercy, you "ba"!

182
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,530
I'll torment you as much as I like,
and turn you into desert dried fish!

183
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,790
Mole Banana!! Here goes!

184
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,970
You can't go after that spot on a guy!

185
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,800
Quit your griping, you "ba"!

186
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:33,060
Mole Banana!! Mole Banana!!
Banana!! Banana!! Banana!!

187
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,950
Terrific!

188
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,190
There are ruins of a wall over there!

189
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,270
If I keep dashing at this speed toward it,

190
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,370
she'll hit the part of the
wall buried under the sand

191
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,650
with a major crash!

192
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,950
Banana!! Banana!!

193
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,460
Come on, come on, come on,

194
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,400
come on!

195
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,160
Now bash your head open!

196
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,760
Wha--?!

197
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,010
Usopp!

198
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,970
Usopp...

199
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,850
I don't have time for that.

200
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,810
The Rumble Ball will only
last for two more minutes.

201
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,490
Usopp will be fine. It will take
more than that to beat him.

202
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,720
Right now, finding their weakness comes first.

203
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,020
Otherwise, we're going to get beaten here.

204
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,560
Yeah, it's just like Usopp
said, isn't it? Right now,

205
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,580
I'll just do whatever I can!

206
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,330
Got crushed, did you?!
You old penguin hag! Serves you right!

207
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,710
I told you, I'm a mole!

208
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,470
Molehill Highway!!

209
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,270
What are you doing?! Let me go!

210
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,610
Stop it! This is dangerous to do out here!
If you go too fast, you'll--

211
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,610
Wah! In front of you! Look!
A wall! A wall in front of you!

212
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,740
Can't you see that?! Stop it!

213
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,960
Mole-Mole Impact!!

214
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,920
I see it! I know your weakness!

215
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,660
Now!

216
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,100
Usopp!

217
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,610
Usopp, can you get up?! Usopp!

218
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,770
Get away from the mole, and her holes!

219
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,130
You don't have to tell me!

220
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,670
Hurry!

221
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,500
What are those guys doing now?

222
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,320
W-What?

223
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,920
The molehill's weakness...

224
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,810
...is that all of the tunnels are connected.

225
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,490
Oh...

226
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,430
...yeah...?

227
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,230
They're alive!

228
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,120
This is bad. My Rumble Ball's
effectiveness is already half gone.

229
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,530
No more...

230
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,120
No more! No more!
We're gonna get killed!

231
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,280
Usopp!

232
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,270
You've gotta be kidding me!
There's no way we can beat them!

233
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,480
Not those monsters!
They're still alive, after that!

234
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,590
No, we can't run away!
Not from these guys!

235
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,820
Usopp!

236
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,810
He's right!

237
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,720
That was an insolent stunt for you to pull!

238
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,490
After going that far,
you can't just run away, you know!

239
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,610
Usopp!

240
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,990
Ha! I guess if the captain is that feeble,
his crew must be wimps, too!

241
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,140
Captain...?

242
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,300
What about Luffy?

243
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,550
If you mean Straw Hat Luffy, he got
killed a while ago, at the boss's hand.

244
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,190
The rebellion has begun, and all...

245
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,890
You guys picked the
wrong people to mess with.

246
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,860
Luffy... is dead...?

247
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,050
Don't you lie to us!

248
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,850
I always wanted to talk about it

249
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,790
I couldn't even say half of it

250
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

251
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:55,650
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

252
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,020
Glory glory you're my shine

253
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,560
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

254
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,100
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

255
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,970
I'm sure I'll make it there

256
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,640
Luffy is dead?

257
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,980
Don't you lie to us, you haggy old mole!

258
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,280
Luffy... Luffy can't be dead!

259
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,990
Usopp!

260
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,660
Hmph! You're a pesky
dancing bastard, to take me on.

261
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,930
The Copy-Copy ability? Ha!
So what if your face has changed?

262
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,330
Let's see what you've got!

263
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,670
On the next episode of One Piece!

264
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,340
"Big Opening Day Today!
The Copy-Copy Montage!"

265
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,620
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
