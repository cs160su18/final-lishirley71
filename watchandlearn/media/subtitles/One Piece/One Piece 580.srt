00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830
It’s important not to wake up

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,450
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,960
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,390
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,720
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,190
After surviving a fierce battle,

78
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,440
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

79
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,530
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

80
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,520
It's erupting again!

81
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,030
It's right there! Who
cares about the needles?!

82
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,160
Hey, what's this? The
Transponder Snail is crying!

83
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,030
Hey, what's wrong?! You have a stomachache?

84
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,500
Fool! That's an emergency signal.

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,660
Somebody's calling for help.

86
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,490
If I pick it up, can we hear them?

87
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,060
Wait, Luffy!

88
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,340
More than 50 percent of
emergency signals are fake!

89
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,930
Help me!

90
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,720
My colleagues are getting
cut one after another!

91
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,980
The samurai are gonna kill us!

92
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,590
Samurai?

93
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,660
Hey you, what's your name?! Where are you?!

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,690
Somebody please help me! I'm on...

95
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,620
...Punk Hazard!

96
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,240
It's hot!

97
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,860
This is the place. The name matches.

98
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,260
So this is Punk Hazard...

99
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,260
Those were probably not people's houses.

100
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,760
I think there were some kind
of Government facilities here.

101
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,660
What's wrong, Luffy?

102
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,230
Is that...

103
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,780
What?!

104
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,620
Huh? Does it actually exist?!

105
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,370
No, it's a mythical creature!
There's no way that it's real!

106
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,620
But look at those features...

107
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,210
I don't think it could be anything else!

108
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,710
"A Battle in the Heat! Luffy
vs. The Giant Dragon!"

109
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
Aw...

110
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,160
Awesome!!

111
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,340
How cool is that!

112
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,470
D-Don't be so impressed!

113
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,290
Cool!!

114
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,060
I'm outta here!

115
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,950
Wow! I like how he snarls, too!

116
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,730
Cool! So cool!

117
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,110
Who are you?

118
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,130
Don't come after me!

119
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,380
What're you doing, you fool?!

120
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,010
Hey!

121
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,560
The dragon just talked!

122
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,540
No way! You're hearing things!

123
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,460
You think so?

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,940
I-I'm not even sure it's a dragon!

125
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,590
Is it really a dragon?

126
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,320
Yes, it's hard to believe but...

127
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,960
...it has a lizard-like
body with giant wings.

128
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,020
It looks exactly how it's described in myths.

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,670
No way!

130
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,770
Oh no!

131
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,170
H-He breathed fire!!

132
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,350
This creature is unreal! Am I dreaming?!

133
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,180
How exciting!

134
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,820
It's my turn!

135
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,040
Second Gear!

136
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,000
Gum-Gum...

137
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,630
...Jet...

138
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,130
Bullet!

139
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,100
It didn't work!

140
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,680
He's well-armored!

141
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,020
Behind you!

142
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,030
Luffy!

143
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,030
He's looking at us!

144
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,300
Come on!

145
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,050
Don't provoke him!

146
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,980
I sense your presence-bu!

147
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,850
What?

148
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,530
Luffy was right!

149
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,970
That dragon just said something!

150
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,870
Three-Sword Style!

151
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,930
Ultra Tiger Hunt!

152
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,710
Damn! He's so strong and durable!

153
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,840
Take this!

154
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,300
Luffy!

155
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,590
I heard him talking!

156
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,360
See?!

157
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,990
I heard it too! But how?

158
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,960
Oh no!

159
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,380
He's flying!

160
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,650
Cool!!

161
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,990
Bu! Are you people allies
of the Seven Warlords too?

162
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,530
The Seven Warlords?!

163
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,410
What're you talking about?

164
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,990
He's gonna breathe fire!

165
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,590
He's right above us! We can't get away!

166
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
It's hot!

167
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,840
Wait for me, Nami-san!

168
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,100
I'll keep making good desserts for you!

169
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,770
Oh yeah!

170
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,360
Let's change our perspective.

171
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,530
Pretend that you're in a sauna.
It feels good, doesn't it?

172
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,950
I am breaking out in a super sweat of cola!

173
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,330
It's strange.

174
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
The sky above the island is divided.

175
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,010
One half is burning hot and
the other is freezing cold.

176
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,980
I wonder why.

177
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,420
I hope Luffy and the others are not melting.

178
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,270
Huh? What was that?

179
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,860
What's wrong?

180
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,890
I don't know. I feel faint...

181
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,050
I feel lightheaded...

182
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,220
Maybe it's heat stroke...

183
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,370
Is this...

184
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,110
...what they call de-cola-ration?

185
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,740
Y-You guys!

186
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,530
Oh? I'm losing it too...

187
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,810
It's hot!

188
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,950
It's hot and that dragon
said something again!

189
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,040
He said "the Seven Warlords."

190
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,740
Does he have something against them?

191
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,790
Oh no!

192
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,220
Luffy! Leave him up to me!

193
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,590
I'll cut him up this time!

194
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,830
All right!

195
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,180
In that case...

196
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,420
Ow, ow, ow!

197
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,810
Let me knock him down first!

198
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,750
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

199
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,990
His body is hot!

200
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,480
Bu! It's strange but it's cool here!

201
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,740
Bu! The flames are cool-bu!

202
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,990
Oh no, not there! It tickles-bu!

203
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,750
Stop it!

204
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,620
That's enough-bu!

205
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,220
That's what I thought!

206
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,920
Hey!

207
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,730
You're not gonna believe this!

208
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,630
Somebody's stuck in the dragon's back!

209
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,510
Huh?! What's going on up there?!

210
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,220
Then the talking voice was...

211
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,490
You bastard!

212
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,160
Eat your own wing!

213
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,420
Fool!

214
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,270
Zoro! Here he comes!

215
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,280
Usopp!

216
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,700
All right!

217
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,990
Special Attack - Green Star!

218
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,000
Trampolia!

219
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,090
One-Sword...

220
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,730
...Style!

221
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,990
Lion Strike!

222
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,170
He did it!

223
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,110
This dragon looks yummy!

224
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,730
We can grill it with the fire on the island!

225
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,560
That sounds great!

226
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,770
Cien Fleurs!

227
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,750
Nami-san!

228
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,630
This time I made a cold crepe
with the Giant Shellfish!

229
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,850
It'll pair nicely with champagne...

230
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,920
Huh?

231
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,050
Oh? Are they sleeping?

232
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,250
Fog?

233
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,790
No, it's not!

234
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,850
Damn! I inhaled too much!

235
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,340
The gas made them sleep!

236
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,260
Is it a natural phenomenon,
indigenous to the New World?

237
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,920
Or did somebody sneak into the ship?

238
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,400
I hope those four

239
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,770
that went to the island took a
Baby Transponder Snail with them.

240
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,940
I have to let them know... somehow...

241
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,080
Two humans...

242
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,960
...one cyborg.

243
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,460
And their pet.

244
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,250
Tie them all up!

245
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,630
Alright!

246
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,050
It's good that they're pirates.

247
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,480
No one will care if they go missing.

248
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,740
Let's take them to the Master!

249
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,470
Luffy and crew have saved
someone from the dragon...

250
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,880
But they are extremely shocked
when they see his bizarre appearance.

251
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,190
Meanwhile, Sanji and the others
have been captured by someone

252
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,390
and are locked in a mysterious room.

253
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,520
It is there that they see an unbelievable sight!

254
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,890
On the next episode of One Piece!

255
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,360
"The Straw Hats Stunned! Enter: A
Samurai's Horrifying Severed Head!"

256
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,510
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
