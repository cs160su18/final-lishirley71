2
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,420
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,970
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,570
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,520
After surviving a fierce battle,--

13
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,240
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

14
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,600
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,650
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,220
an island with two parts,
one burning, the other frozen

17
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,240
and were held captive by Caesar Clown
who rules the island

18
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,540
and were exposed to Shinokuni,
a weapon of mass destruction.

19
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,290
But they broke out thanks to their ally -

20
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,620
a Warlord - Trafalgar Law's tactful maneuvers

21
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,470
and were reunited with their crew

22
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,960
and began heading towards the "R-66" door,

23
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,530
while Luffy finally got to
Caesar's research room

24
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,460
and launched an intense battle to catch him.

25
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,060
You can't tell me...

26
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,770
...what to do!

27
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,710
Do you still wanna get hurt,
rubber bastard?!

28
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,560
Karakuni!

29
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,320
I can't breathe again!

30
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,860
Gum-Gum...

31
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,200
I won't let you do it!

32
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,410
...Jet Pistol!

33
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,230
Th-That was fast!

34
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,920
Blue Sword!

35
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,140
Gum-Gum...

36
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,810
...Jet Gatling!

37
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,390
What's this?! A wall?!

38
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,980
Kamakura.

39
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,750
I'm impressed.

40
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,650
Only you could break this wall!

41
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,240
Are you a Devil Fruit eater?

42
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Dammit! You rubber bastard!

43
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
What are you doing?!

44
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,140
Are you gonna run?!

45
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,830
Goodbye, Straw Hat!

46
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,520
Be as wild as you want!

47
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,510
I already have an idea of how to make
you people test subjects without fail!

48
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,460
Look forward to it!

49
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,190
Wait!

50
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,180
I won't let you go after him.

51
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,560
If anything happens to the Master,

52
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,260
Joker will kill me.

53
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,260
"A Mastermind Underground!
Doflamingo Makes His Move!"

54
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,530
THE "SAD" MANUFACTURING ROOM

55
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,860
This thing

56
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,020
will shake up the New World.

57
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,490
THE PASSAGE BETWEEN BUILDING A AND B

58
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,050
This is D Building!

59
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,780
This is an emergency broadcast

60
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,620
to all buildings of the Third Laboratory!

61
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,920
The traitor - Trafalgar Law has...

62
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,630
...just entered into the SAD manufacturing room!

63
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,000
Stay with me!

64
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,930
I repeat.

65
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,300
The traitor - Trafalgar Law has...

66
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,820
Wait, wait, don't close it yet!

67
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,760
The Vergo impostor  and
"Black Foot" are still in there!

68
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,620
It's closed!

69
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,050
It's too late!

70
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,060
The other side of the gate
is filled with the deadly gas!

71
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,270
Black Foot!

72
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,600
Young man!

73
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,070
Black Foot guy!

74
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,890
Hey!

75
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,620
Are you okay?!

76
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,010
The Navy's...

77
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,110
That's...

78
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,280
...cutie-san!

79
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,290
Oh, Black Foot!

80
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,960
Black Foot guy!

81
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,900
I'm glad that you're alive!

82
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,320
Thank you!

83
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,300
Shut up, you shitheads!

84
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,050
Listen!

85
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,090
I only accept accolades from girls!

86
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,810
Hey, Black Foot!

87
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,880
Did you get hurt?

88
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,100
Shut up!

89
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,730
I only accept concern from girls!

90
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,120
That was close!

91
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,850
If I kept fighting with him...

92
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,880
In any case,
what's wrong with that guy?

93
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,280
He's your superior, isn't he?

94
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,710
No way!

95
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,420
That can't be Vice Admiral Vergo!

96
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,760
That was an impostor!

97
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,330
Right, Captain-chan?!

98
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,100
Soon, you'll see that they're very loyal.

99
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,650
Of course it's not him!

100
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,250
Vice Admiral Vergo

101
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,090
is like a father to you all!

102
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,720
He wouldn't do such a thing!

103
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,930
Yes, Vice Admiral Vergo is a kind
man who cares so much about us!

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Hmm... Well,

105
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,470
I don't know if that
was an impostor or not

106
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,820
but he turned pale
and went somewhere.

107
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,550
We have to get going, too.

108
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,230
We have to save the children

109
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,500
and escape from here!

110
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,050
Yeah!

111
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,820
Yeah!

112
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,000
We'll follow you, Captain-chan!

113
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,170
INSIDE OF B BUILDING

114
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,740
Law's going after SAD?!

115
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes,

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,430
now there is no doubt
that Law is betraying us.

117
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,310
I see.

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,200
THE NEW WORLD "DRESSROSA"

119
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,960
That's what I thought.

120
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,000
I have treated him as my young brother

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,630
THE WARLORD - DON QUIXOTE DOFLAMINGO
(THE UNDERGROUND BROKER - JOKER)

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,630
and watched closely over him as he grew up.

123
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,590
What a shame.

124
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,800
I understand.

125
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,040
He's at the SAD manufacturing room, huh?

126
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,710
Here is what I would do
if I were him.

127
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,440
First,

128
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,730
I'd destroy that room.

129
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,120
And kidnap Caesar?

130
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,120
No, I would just kill him.

131
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,620
How could you do that
to my boyfriend?!

132
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,920
Because Caesar is...

133
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,090
...the only person in the world...

134
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,720
...who knows how to produce SAD.

135
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,770
But if he does such things,

136
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll be in trouble, Vergo.

137
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,200
If Caesar gets killed,

138
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,830
no one else can produce that gas.

139
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,940
Then it will ruin my business.

140
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,500
Chill out-in, Baby 5.

141
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,610
You can't do that to the Young Master-in.

142
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,440
I'm not gonna forgive him this time!

143
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,950
I'm gonna kill

144
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,620
that asshole!

145
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,810
And what would happen next,
if I got into such trouble?

146
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,790
Hey-in!

147
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,880
And after that?

148
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,220
Misfortunes never come singly.

149
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,700
What are you going to
do with that cute boy -

150
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,890
Law-chan,

151
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,130
Young Master?

152
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,810
You know what he's gonna do.

153
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,300
Law is rebelling against us.

154
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,650
Right, Young Master?

155
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,720
I know it's hard for you, Vergo,

156
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,340
but I need you to take
care of Law there.

157
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,780
I wanna make him wish
that he was never born.

158
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,080
So kill him in a horrific way.

159
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,770
Understood.

160
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,950
I'll shoot a picture of his
dead body and show you,

161
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,710
Doffy.

162
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,190
With the camera I bought at Dressrosa.

163
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,900
You didn't buy a camera.

164
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,340
You're right.

165
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,930
I didn't buy a camera.

166
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,950
Then I'll cut his ear off.

167
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm looking forward to see it.

168
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,280
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

169
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,200
Caesar. Monet.
Can you hear me?

170
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,830
Yes, Joker.

171
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,200
Joker?

172
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,500
Oh, Joker!

173
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,500
You have to be careful with Law,

174
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,940
of course, but also with Straw Hat.

175
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,620
That brat uses Conqueror's Haki.

176
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,890
He could be of a higher caliber than Law.

177
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,680
Oh, are you really?

178
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,380
He uses

179
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,440
Conqueror's Haki?!

180
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,390
We happen to have a
hot-blooded woman here.

181
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm gonna send Baby 5
and Buffalo there.

182
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,600
When it's done,

183
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,830
you all need to come to Dressrosa once.

184
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,960
Yes.

185
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,300
All right.

186
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,840
C BUILDING 4TH FLOOR  -
CAESAR'S RESEARCH ROOM

187
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,880
Clank.

188
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,010
I don't know what
the bird guy was saying

189
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,930
but I'm gonna catch Caesar!

190
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,530
What's this?!

191
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,350
Snow?!

192
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,520
Damn!

193
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,350
I won't let you do that!

194
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,740
Why is it snowing inside?!

195
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,200
I'm a snow woman
who ate the Snow-Snow Fruit.

196
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,000
I can control snow at will.

197
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,820
How do you like my power?

198
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,310
It's nothing!

199
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,670
It's just snow!

200
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,050
But what about something like this?

201
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,820
Gum-Gum...

202
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,910
...Pistol!

203
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,270
Gum-Gum...

204
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,350
...Pistol!

205
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,420
It didn't work, huh?

206
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,370
I'm sorry

207
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,710
but you need to stay here for a while.

208
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,880
Gum-Gum...

209
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,840
Kamakura!

210
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,990
This thing again.

211
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,980
Second Gear!

212
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,420
Gum-Gum...

213
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,820
...Jet Gatling!

214
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,560
Where did she go?

215
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,270
B BUILDING 3RD FLOOR -
NEAR THE BISCUIT ROOM

216
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,690
Open the door!

217
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,620
Uh-huh!

218
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,880
I see!

219
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,540
Then I won't let anybody
eat the candy!

220
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,320
I wanna go home with everybody!

221
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,160
Great!

222
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,330
Open the door, Mocha!

223
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,220
They're gonna break
the door in any minute!

224
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,570
Mocha, you better go!

225
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,180
Uh-huh.  But what are you
gonna do, Chopper-chan?

226
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,230
I'm gonna try to hold the children here!

227
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,640
You go and throw out all the
candies in the Biscuit Room!

228
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,180
Okay!

229
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,780
I'll be counting on you, Mocha!

230
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,670
Uh-huh!

231
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,790
INSIDE OF B BUILDING THE
BROWNBEARD EXPRESS AND ITS RIDERS

232
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,490
This dragon is more annoying
than that big one.

233
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,720
He's quicker.

234
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,910
Why are you lying around?!

235
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,430
Stop that dragon!

236
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,230
B Building is sea of flame.

237
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,650
If we don't stop him and

238
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,110
one of these tanks
catches fire and explodes...

239
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,950
The outer walls will break and
the deadly gas will flow in!

240
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,080
If we let that happen,

241
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,580
no one can survive!

242
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,540
We've got to do something
or we're dead!

243
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,330
Wait, you all!

244
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,440
I can't hold my own

245
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,050
when it comes to dragons!

246
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,360
I have a grudge against them!

247
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,470
I will definitely take care of him...

248
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,930
No no!

249
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,140
I can't forgive that dragon, either!

250
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,360
What are you so mad?!

251
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,000
Because...

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,780
Didn't you see his attitude
toward me earlier?!

253
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,450
What?!

254
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,360
He charged up to me
to eat me and...

255
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,870
Huh? Excuse me!

256
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,260
What?!

257
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,950
He showed his disappointment
before my eyes! What an insult!

258
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,050
I can't stand it!

259
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,620
I really can't stand it!

260
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,850
That's because you have no flesh.

261
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,090
Bones are nutritious, too!

262
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,730
Alright. I'll keep that in mind.

263
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,520
Kin'emon-san, let me do it!

264
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,050
What are you talking about?!

265
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,400
Just stay back!

266
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,770
No, I'll do it!

267
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,530
I'll do it!

268
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,490
No, me (watashi)!

269
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,320
Me (sessha)!

270
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,040
Me (watasha)!

271
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,780
Oops?

272
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,200
Come on! Come on!

273
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,060
Nin, nin, nin!

274
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,840
What are you doing?

275
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,710
Pretending to be a samurai.

276
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,880
But that's what ninjas do!

277
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,300
Here he comes!

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,470
Thunder Trap!

279
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,510
No, my (watasha) opponent!

280
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,580
Wh-What?!

281
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,850
Breast-band girl!

282
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,270
I didn't know you used
ninja arts skills!

283
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,140
Stop calling me that!

284
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,570
Smell the stinkiest flower in the world!

285
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,770
Special Attack - Green Star!

286
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,410
Rafflesia!

287
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,530
So, the long-nosed goblin
monster uses sorcery!

288
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,740
"Monster"?!

289
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,190
Cuarenta Fleurs!

290
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,410
Cuatro Mano!

291
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,500
Hold!

292
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,170
Even the courtesan
uses ninja arts skills!

293
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,730
He's falling!

294
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,390
I'll finish him off!

295
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,510
No, let me do it!

296
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,850
Here he comes!

297
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,820
Follow my lead!

298
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,820
Corpse-dono!

299
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,360
Foxfire Style!

300
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,590
Flame Split!

301
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,710
He cut flames again!

302
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,670
Good job!

303
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,130
Thanks!

304
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,740
Gavotte Bon en Avant!

305
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,930
Flaming Flash!

306
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,900
Did you call me "Corpse"?!

307
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,550
Oh, I am a corpse.

308
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,160
Yeah!

309
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,820
We did it!

310
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,500
It's a total victory!

311
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,420
Hey! Say "Bones are delicious"!

312
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,080
How annoying!

313
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
You puny dragon!

314
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,680
Damn you! Damn you!

315
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,930
Damn you! Damn you!

316
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,680
Damn you! Damn you!
Damn you! Damn you!

317
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,710
I have a good reason to
hate him but, Kin'emon-san,

318
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,880
why are you kicking the dragon
as if he killed your parents?

319
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,940
It was no worse than
having my parents killed!

320
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,510
Whoa! Th-That's...

321
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,660
Both of you, get back on already!

322
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,120
Or we'll leave you here!

323
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,050
Please wait!

324
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,520
Oh? Hey, look at that!

325
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,140
That must be...

326
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,810
Chopper has transformed
into a monster!

327
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,120
Take this!

328
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,830
What is he doing?

329
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,780
B BUILDING 2ND FLOOR - AN EXAMINATION ROOM

330
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:38,870
Here.

331
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,060
Hmm...

332
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,340
I don't see any problem.

333
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,470
You can go back to the Biscuit Room now.

334
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,750
Really?!

335
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,670
Yes.

336
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,510
The candy is there, too.

337
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,050
Yes!

338
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,730
Oh yeah, where did the boy go?

339
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,770
The boy?

340
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,440
Uh-huh.

341
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,070
He entered into the "secret
room" where no one is allowed

342
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,340
and transformed into a small dragon.

343
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,990
The boy named Momonosuke.

344
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,210
The one who wields the powers
of the Snow-Snow Fruit: Monet.

345
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,880
Luffy is at the mercy of those powers,

346
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,590
trapped within a wall of snow,

347
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,930
and his strength is greatly drained.

348
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,850
Meanwhile,

349
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,390
Law is faced with danger, as well.

350
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

351
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,390
"Luffy Dies from Exposure?!
The Spine-chilling Snow Woman Monet!"

352
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
