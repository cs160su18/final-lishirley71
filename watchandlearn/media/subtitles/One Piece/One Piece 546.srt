00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,850
We won’t left anyone behind

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,320

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,140
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,150
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,660
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,460
On their way to the New World,

74
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,670
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

75
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,140
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

76
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,430
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

77
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,810
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

78
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,100
--Mother-sama!
--Mother-sama!

79
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,610
Otohime-sama!

80
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,690
Where are you going, Otohime-sama?

81
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,990
Otohime...

82
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,910
Trust the woman who you chose to be your wife

83
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,370
and the humans.

84
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,000
Mother-sama!

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,090
Mother-sama!

86
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,510
Otohime-sama!

87
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,970
Your Majesty! Please be careful!

88
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,890
Mother-sama!

89
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:30,490
"A Sudden Tragedy!
A Gunshot Shuts Down the Future!"

90
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,870
Queen Otohime's voyage was to determine
the fate of the Fish-Man Island.

91
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,420
Of course, we were all worrying
but it was nothing compared to

92
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,510
the burden of the Neptune family.

93
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,010
The whole Ryugu Kingdom was restless.

94
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,810
But all we could do was pray
for the Queen's safety.

95
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,440
What? A Tamate Box?

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,820
Yes, Captain. I heard that they
have one at the Ryugu Palace.

97
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,740
And it makes anyone grow older?

98
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,830
That's what they say.

99
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,460
For instance, a small brat like her...

100
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,210
...would become a sexy mature woman?

101
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,090
I think so.

102
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,670
Great! Problem solved!

103
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,590
In that case, I can get married to
Shirahoshi right away, I suspect!

104
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,970
Go steal that Tamate Box thing now!

105
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,850
Wait a minute. There is no way
to break in to the Ryugu Palace.

106
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,400
--But if you get married to Shirahoshi first...
--You can go in and out as you please.

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,490
You guys are smart!

108
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,360
Shirahoshi is not bad-looking.

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,950
If she grows older by 10 to 20 years,
she will be really hot!

110
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,080
But she'll get even bigger.

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,080
She'll look just fine! I like big women!

112
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,920
She's the legendary Mermaid
Princess who can control the Sea Kings.

113
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,140
When I become her husband
and seize that power,

114
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,350
our dream will come true!

115
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:19,190
It's the dream of all the ancestors
of Vander Decken family!

116
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,270
Alright, I'll start writing
an invitation to our wedding.

117
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,490
You have to propose to her first!

118
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,110
Oh, I don't have any friends!

119
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,950
There had been no word
from the Queen for days.

120
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,120
WE NEED YOUR SIGNATURE FOR
THE FUTURE OF THE ISLAND!

121
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,950
And worries kept growing.

122
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,460
I wanna hear her speeches again.

123
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,290
Please come back safe!

124
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,010
Hey, Boss. Where is Otohime-sama?

125
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,220
When will she come back?

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Keep faith in her and wait.

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,470
She embarked on a voyage to make
the future better for you kids.

128
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,060
Your Majesty, please be safe.

129
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,280
Mother-sama...

130
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,580
She will be fine-jamon.

131
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,830
Let's trust in her and wait-jamon.

132
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,010
That one week felt like 100 days.

133
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,340
And then...

134
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,980
That's...

135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,300
Yeah! Otohime-sama!

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,760
Your Majesty!

137
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,980
We are so happy just to see you alive!

138
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,060
Welcome back!

139
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,230
Your Majesty!

140
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,860
After a few days of convincing,
Queen Otohime finally succeeded...

141
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,410
...in calming down the Celestial Dragons and
she brought back with her a sheet of paper...

142
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,750
...which held the fate
of the Fish-Man Island.

143
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,580
CONCHCORDE PLAZA

144
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,670
Everyone, the World Nobles
are very influential...

145
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,590
...in the World Summit - the Summit of Kings.

146
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,430
Listen to what they wrote
on this sheet of paper.

147
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,060
"To foster friendship between
the Fish-Men and humans,

148
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,980
we will pledge our endorsement
of their duly signed petition."

149
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,650
That means if we can submit a petition
with many signatures at the Summit,

150
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:18,160
this one sheet of paper will
give us all the support we need.

151
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,030
We can relocate!

152
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,620
--The Celestial Dragons will support the petition?
--I have mixed feelings about it.

153
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,590
So what I need now is more signatures.

154
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,210
All I can do is wait for
you to make a decision.

155
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,380
Express your intention...

156
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,970
...to relocate to the world above and
live together with the humans!

157
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,900
Please! Sign!

158
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,190
I need your signature!

159
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,300
You children, you aren't going to go back
on your pledge after raising my hopes?

160
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,840
We won't! My mom said she will sign too.

161
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,340
Otohime-sama,
this small box won't be enough.

162
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,010
Don't you know the
population of this country?

163
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,140
Here, here, here! Put
them in here from now on!

164
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,270
Those of you who support the Queen's passion,
put your signature in here!

165
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,590
The Fish-Men and humans.

166
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,430
We were trying to ignore
the history of racism.

167
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:50,930
But the Queen took the first
step herself and now we have hope.

168
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,980
If she can get enough signatures,
the future of the island could change for real.

169
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,660
It would have helped Arlong if
he could have understood better...

170
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,490
...about Queen Otohime's firm belief.

171
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,370
I wish Brother Tai were here to see this.

172
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,470
Mother! Signatures keep coming
in from all over the country!

173
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,100
--It's going well, isn't it?
--Yes, it's like a dream.

174
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,640
It's because of your courage!

175
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,100
Courage?

176
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:39,900
I got encouraged at that very moment,
that this island would change for sure.

177
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,980
That moment?

178
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,410
Yes, the moment that the Sea Kings
came and stared at the island.

179
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,530
That was surprising!

180
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,290
Shirahoshi called them.

181
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,120
What?

182
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,170
We Merfolk can communicate
with fish and talk to them, right?

183
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,930
But no one can talk to those great Sea Kings.

184
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:14,430
Even your father Neptune who can talk to whales,
doesn't know how to talk to them.

185
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,400
But according to our royal family's legend,
once in several hundred years,

186
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,780
one with an ability to communicate
with the Sea Kings, will be born.

187
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,700
--With those giant Sea Kings?!
--And Shirahoshi is the one?

188
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Yes, and she will meet someone who will guide
her and her power in the right direction

189
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,500
and it will cause a major change the world.

190
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,300
And that is the whole story.

191
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,630
The world?

192
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,840
If it's true, there will be a
major change on this island too.

193
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,100
Could it help what you're doing?

194
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,060
Yes, it could.

195
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,940
It's a power of love that can save thousands
of lives if only the bearer wishes to.

196
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,690
But with the wrong intentions, that power
could sink the whole world into the ocean.

197
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,530
It is one of the most
fearsome powers in the world.

198
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,410
Shirahoshi doesn't know that she
has that power and she doesn't know

199
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,240
how to control it yet.

200
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,790
If something were ever to shock her,

201
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:25,300
she could unintentionally
drive the Sea Kings berserk.

202
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,840
What?

203
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,390
The Fish-Man Island would be flattened
like a pancake! What should we do?!

204
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,930
Don't worry! I can take care of it for now.

205
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,270
But the three of you will have to
become strong warriors someday

206
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,940
and as her brothers and as warriors,

207
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,650
protect your baby sister with your lives!

208
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,280
--Yes!
--Of course!

209
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,240
Thank you.

210
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,460
But then the unexpected happened...

211
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,930
Signatures were mounting up at a rapid pace.

212
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,980
The islanders still didn't trust humans

213
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,980
but they were hoping to see
the beginning of a new era.

214
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,740
Queen Otohime!

215
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,820
We brought our signatures again!

216
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,120
That's against the rules!
Each person can only vote once!

217
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,790
W-We're sorry...

218
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,330
But it means a lot to me that you did so.

219
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,670
Thank you so much.

220
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,300
Your efforts finally paid off.

221
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,360
Get away! Fire!

222
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,440
--How could the box catch fire?
--Water! Water!

223
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,950
Put out the fire now!

224
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,280
I can't believe it!

225
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,370
The signatures we collected!

226
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,330
Run now!

227
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,910
O-Otohime-sama!

228
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,330
Put out the fire! We have
to save the signatures!

229
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,130
No! It's too dangerous!

230
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,290
They are very important! I have to save them!

231
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,420
Your Majesty!

232
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,970
We can't let them burn!
They are everyone's dream!

233
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,220
They are the future of the Fish-Man Island!

234
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,470
Yes, ma'am!

235
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,810
Save the signatures now!

236
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,390
Yes, sir!

237
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
Please save yourself!
Leave the rest up to us!

238
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,190
Otohime-sama has been shot!

239
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,320
Who did it?!

240
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,030
The shooter must be here somewhere!
Protect the royal family!

241
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,280
--Mother!
--Mother-sama!

242
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,820
It's dangerous here! Get on the gondola now!

243
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,410
Princes!

244
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,910
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

245
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,580
--Your Majesty!
--Otohime-sama!

246
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,670
Oh no, Princess, this is pretty serious...

247
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,970
--Who're you?!
--Oops!

248
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,720
--Stay away from the Princess!
--Stop!

249
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,600
--Mother-sama! Mother!
--Mother!

250
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,190
M-Mother!

251
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,860
Dammit! Who the hell did it?!

252
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,700
--Didn't an emergency team arrive yet?!
--Mother! Mother!

253
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,160
Open your eyes!

254
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,370
This can't be forgiven! I'll make him pay!

255
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,460
Mother!

256
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,380
Stay near me, my angels.

257
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,710
Don't lose your temper.

258
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:45,350
My guard was down. Because I was
thrilled that everybody was signing.

259
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,180
I was so happy!

260
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,900
Prince Fukaboshi, I should
be the one who is frustrated.

261
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,940
Your Majesty, you need treatment now!

262
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,030
So it doesn't matter who did this...

263
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,660
Don't get angry on my behalf.

264
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:15,380
Don't let resentment or hatred
get the better of you for my sake.

265
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,230
M-Mother-sama...

266
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,400
Shirahoshi, keep your senses.

267
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:52,040
If something were ever to shock her...

268
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,670
This is just like...!

269
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,930
Shirahoshi, no!

270
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,310
Hey, Shirahoshi!

271
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,280
Moonfish mambo! Moonfish mambo!

272
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,200
Moonfish mambo! Moonfish mambo!

273
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,320
Look, Shirahoshi!

274
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,700
Moonfish mambo! Moonfish mambo!

275
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,540
--It's fun! It's fun!
--Shake, shake! Shake, shake!

276
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,670
--It's nothing! Let's sing Shirahoshi!
--Moonfish mambo! Shake, shake, shake!

277
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,250
We three will always be
there for you-la-ti-do!

278
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,680
Mambo dance is fun!

279
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,470
It's fun!

280
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,600
It's fun-do-re-mi-fa!

281
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,560
P-Princes, what are you doing?!

282
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,610
--Stop them!
--That's not appropriate!

283
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,320
Mother, look, we're fine!

284
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,740
We will protect our baby sister
like this forever-la-ti-do!

285
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,000
Stop it! Can't you see
the Queen's situation?!

286
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,210
Mother-sama!

287
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,460
We will collect the signatures
that burned away again.

288
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,380
We three will become great
warriors like our father...

289
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,060
...and protect Shirahoshi
with our lives as we promised!

290
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,730
So please...

291
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,610
Please don't worry!

292
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,570
We are almost there!

293
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,450
At that place under the real sun!

294
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,170
After Otohime's death, Fish-Man
Island is consumed by rage.

295
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,970
Is this the end for her ideal?

296
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,050
After relating the subsequent
events on Fish-Man Island,

297
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,760
and finishing his story, Jimbei
again apologizes to Nami.

298
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,640
But Nami's reply was utterly unexpected!

299
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,650
On the next episode of One Piece!

300
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,770
"Back to the Present! Hordy Makes a Move!"

301
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
