00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,680
"Alabasta's Hero and
a Ballerina on the Ship!"

22
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,490
Out of our way! Out of our way!

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,140
Crocodile-sama...

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,990
Crocodile-sama!

25
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,890
Crocodile!

26
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,030
Huh?

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,330
Ahh... Crocodile-sama!

28
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,740
As always, he came for us!

29
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,700
Crocodile?!

30
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't tell me it's the Crocodile,
one of the Seven Warlords...

31
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,340
Shut up, ignorant people!

32
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,660
I just came to get that pirate's head.

33
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,390
He's so wonderful...

34
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,140
That's what you always say,
but you always save us.

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Hurray for Crocodile!

36
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,990
Alabasta's Guardian Angel!

37
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,990
Crocodile!

38
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,930
Crocodile!

39
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,630
King of the desert! Crocodile!

40
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,260
Well, call me what you will.

41
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,240
Anyway, pirates, don't cause
a ruckus in this country.

42
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,150
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Aren't you underestimating us?

43
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,580
Are you planning to take
on all of us by yourself?!

44
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,830
You're the government's dog,
one who sold his soul to authority!

45
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,650
Who do you think you are,
acting like a hero?!

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,990
Those who don't wanna die,
lay down on the ground.

47
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,960
Is he an idiot or what?!
He's a perfect target for us!

48
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,880
Get him! The money and
valuables in this town are ours!

49
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah!

50
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,890
So this is what the famous
Seven Warlords are like?!

51
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,900
Humph...

52
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,880
I'm a pirate on a
different level, you pig.

53
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,380
Ah!

54
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,250
Crocodile!

55
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:52,900
Crocodile! Crocodile...

56
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,390
Crocodile again...

57
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,920
"Alubarna Palace, Alabasta Kingdom"

58
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,680
He was one step ahead again?

59
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,730
By the time we got to Nanohana,
it was already...

60
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,920
I see...

61
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,560
Either way, it's fine as long
as the citizens are okay.

62
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,300
"King of Alabasta, Nefertari Cobra"

63
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,640
He does a lot for us.

64
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,550
There's no mistake.
This ship is heading to Alabasta.

65
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,730
I'll be there soon...

66
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,710
Luffy! Don't lie!

67
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,650
Tell me what you know.

68
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,120
Hey, why are you looking away?
Look me in the eyes!

69
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,080
Well, seriously... I don't know anything.

70
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,790
Then let me ask you something.

71
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,400
How did enough food for 8 people,

72
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,470
which I carefully divided so that
it'd last until we get to Alabasta,

73
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,320
disappear during the night?

74
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,350
Stop fighting, it's pointless!
You've got a horrible poker face.

75
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,440
Burp...

76
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,730
Hey, you have something
around your mouth.

77
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,200
Ah! Shoot! Food crumbs?!

78
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,400
See, it was you!

79
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,130
Geez...

80
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,410
Ahhh, Nami-san...
You saw it, right?

81
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,420
The large rat trap
is no longer good enough.

82
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,130
Please buy a lockable refrigerator.

83
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,480
Well...

84
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,300
I'll think about it... since it
can be a life or death issue...

85
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Hm?

86
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,130
Well...! We'd better catch
something for Sanji-kun...

87
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,950
Hey, any luck fishing?

88
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,040
W-Well...

89
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,560
I feel good...

90
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,520
Seriously, I can't take my eyes
off these guys for a moment...

91
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,110
Ahh... I'm starving...
The fish aren't biting at all...

92
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,480
Luffy! It's your fault!
It's because you even ate the bait!

93
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,840
If we don't have bait,
the fish won't bite!

94
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,520
You ate it, too!

95
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,560
Well... I only ate the
stuff on the bait box cover.

96
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,390
Luffy-san. Usopp-san.
Have you caught anything?

97
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,860
Ahh!

98
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,480
Karoo! Oh no!

99
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,930
I wonder if we can
catch a shark or something...

100
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,250
I wanna catch a Sea King.

101
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,320
What're you two... doing to Karoo?!

102
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
What's that?

103
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,190
What the heck is that?

104
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,600
I wonder if it's cotton candy...

105
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,510
I'll go get Nami-san!

106
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,770
Hm?

107
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,600
Nami-san, there's a problem!
Come right away!

108
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,700
Ahh... don't worry.
It's nothing. It's just steam.

109
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,180
Steam is coming up from the sea?

110
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,670
Yeah. It's a hot spot.

111
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,250
What the heck is that?

112
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,400
It's an area where magma is produced.

113
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,120
There's an undersea volcano
underneath that area.

114
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,130
I see...

115
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,620
A volcano even though it's undersea?

116
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:48,350
That's right. There're more undersea
volcanoes than above ground ones.

117
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,230
Woah...

118
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,340
I don't really care...
since it's not food.

119
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,870
With the volcano like this,

120
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,030
a new island will be born here over
thousands or tens of thousands of years.

121
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,490
You're so cool, Nami-san!

122
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,950
Tens of thousands of years...
I wonder if I can live that long...

123
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,550
Well, you're a human. So you should
try dying sometime before that...

124
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,460
Have you caught anything?

125
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,320
Oh hey, Sanji. I'm hungry.
Cook something.

126
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,460
You guys're hopeless...

127
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,090
I'll go search the storage thoroughly
to see if there's anything left.

128
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,780
Whoa!

129
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,440
Ahh! It smells of sulfur!

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,640
We can't see anything!
There's steam everywhere!

131
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,350
Bear with it. We should
be through it soon.

132
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,820
Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama!

133
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,980
What is it?!

134
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,870
There's smoke at 12 o'clock!

135
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,980
It doesn't matter! Cut through it!

136
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,940
At any rate, unless we take care
of Mr. 3, I'll be in danger!

137
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,440
Yes sir! We're going in!

138
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,040
What is this foggy thing?

139
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,370
We can't see ahead!

140
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,710
Ah!

141
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,330
We got through!

142
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,820
Ahh! Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama is gone!

143
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,880
Look for him in the cabins!

144
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,820
We can't find him!

145
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,720
Can't be!

146
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,310
Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama!

147
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,150
Whoa...!

148
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,370
Shoot!

149
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,840
Why did I jump on the duck
that I suddenly came across?!

150
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,170
Is he a human?

151
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,610
Dunno...

152
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,010
Oh?! Ahh!

153
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,130
Help me! Please!

154
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,200
I can't swim--!

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,600
I thought I'd die...

156
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,940
Well... I'm really swanny.

157
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,410
To think that I was saved by
pirates who are total strangers...

158
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,320
I will never forget your
kindness for the rest of my life!

159
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,730
Also, may I have a cup of warm soup?

160
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,890
We don't have it!

161
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,590
We're the ones who're hungry!

162
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,040
Oh, hey you! What a cutie!

163
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,940
You're my type!
I wanna eat you! Smooch!

164
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,720
Such a weirdo...

165
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,990
So you can't swim, huh?

166
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,990
That's right. I ate a devil fruit.

167
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,940
Really? What kind of fruit?

168
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,790
Well... since there's no need to rush
until my ship comes to pick me up...

169
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,230
In lieu of entertainment,
I'll show you...

170
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,710
This is my power!

171
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,070
What're you...

172
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,390
Wait! Wait! Wait!

173
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,960
I just told you that
this is entertainment!

174
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,670
What?!

175
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,210
Gimme a break!

176
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,050
Ah?!

177
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,670
That's me!

178
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
Surprised?! Surprised?! Surprised?!

179
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,090
If I touch my face with my left hand...

180
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,890
See?! I'm back to myself!

181
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,730
This is the power of the
Clone Clone Fruit I ate!

182
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,730
The voice, too...

183
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,710
The body was also the same...

184
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,760
A... Amazing!

185
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,870
There...!

186
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,160
Well, for that matter,
I don't have to knock you down...

187
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,840
Now, look!

188
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,760
All I have to do is...

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,830
touch faces with my right hand.

190
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,720
As you can see, I can...

191
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,770
mimic anyone!

192
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,470
Bodies, too!

193
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,380
Ahh!

194
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,310
Ouch!

195
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,590
Stop it!

196
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,450
Hey, are you all right?

197
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,720
Ow, ow, ow...

198
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,430
Well... sorry, but I can't
show any more of my power...

199
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,830
You're amazing! Do it more!

200
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,280
Ahhh... Well... if you insist...
I guess I'll show more...

201
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,870
Yeah! Show it! Show it!

202
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,230
Gee, he's actually into it!

203
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,940
We wanna see! We wanna see!

204
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,470
Furthermore, I'm equipped
with a memory feature!

205
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,460
Here we go!

206
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,450
Whoa!

207
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,040
Ah!

208
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,560
Spin! Spin! Spin!

209
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,880
How stupid!

210
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,110
Spin! Spin!

211
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,140
So how was my secret talent?!

212
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,860
I usually never show it to others.

213
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,480
Cool!

214
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,290
Gimme a break! Gimme a break!

215
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,290
Amazing! Amazing! He's amazing!

216
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,890
Oh whatever!

217
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,300
That's my ship!

218
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,820
Amazing! Amazing! He's...

219
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,540
Whoosh!

220
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,730
It's already time to say goodbye...?
What a shame...

221
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,860
What?!

222
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,060
Please don't go!

223
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,930
Don't be sad!

224
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,500
Journeys are always
accompanied by farewells..

225
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,810
But don't ever forget this.

226
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,550
Friendship... has nothing to do with
how long we've known each other.

227
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,040
Don't cry!

228
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,270
See you again!

229
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,180
Now, let's go, guys!

230
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,480
Yes sir! Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama!

231
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,860
Mr. 2?!

232
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,700
So he is... Mr. 2, Bon Clay...!

233
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,360
Vivi! You didn't know his face?!

234
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,350
No... I've never met Mr. 2
and Mr. 1 as well as his partner.

235
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,210
I don't know their powers, either...

236
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,350
though I've heard of rumors...

237
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,600
Mr. 2 is...

238
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,220
a ballerina with a large frame...
who talks like a woman...

239
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,220
He always wears a swan coat that
has "Bon Clay" on the back...

240
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,780
You should've noticed!

241
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,330
What's the matter, Vivi?

242
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,570
Among the faces that he
showed from his past memory...

243
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,420
from his memory...

244
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,040
I saw my father's face...

245
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,000
the face of Alabasta's King,
Nefertari Cobra...

246
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,200
If, for example,
you could mimic a king...

247
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,250
you'd be able to do
quite bad things, too...

248
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,020
We let a troublesome
guy slip away, huh?

249
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,340
Then he's our enemy?

250
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,480
He's certainly quite a problem
if he's on our enemy's side.

251
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,960
If he realizes that we're his enemy...

252
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,790
If he transforms into one of us
using his memory from earlier...

253
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,630
we won't be able to
trust our own friends.

254
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,790
Ah...!

255
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,490
Really? Huh?

256
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,180
Listen, Luffy...

257
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,530
Well, hold on.

258
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,910
It's true that his opinion
doesn't have any basis,

259
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,290
but he's right about us not
having to be scared of him.

260
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,090
We should consider ourselves lucky
that we got to see him now...

261
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,740
because we can figure
out counter-measures.

262
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,800
Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama is in a
very good mood for some reason.

263
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,800
Un, deux, trios! How do you say 4?!

264
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,730
I found a small friendship!

265
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,730
Something came out!

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,910
Sea Cat!

267
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,920
It's a sea monster!

268
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,090
It's the first meal in 4 days!

269
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,420
It's a meal!

270
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,490
We're on the right track.

271
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,510
I hope we get there pretty soon...

272
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,750
It's a meal!

273
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,060
Whoa! It backed away!

274
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,870
Have the ship go back! Go back!

275
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,900
W-W-W-W-W-We can't!

276
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,190
Ah! Don't let it get away!
Capture it without fail!

277
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,200
How should I cook you, cat monster?!

278
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,150
No!

279
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,150
Vivi! You jerk! What're you doing?!

280
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,730
W... Why... Vivi-chan?

281
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,540
You can't eat it!

282
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,360
Sea Cats are a
sacred animal in Alabasta!

283
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,500
You should've told us sooner!

284
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,090
There sure are many kinds
of creatures in the sea!

285
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,370
Being scared of things like that...
You've still got a long way to go...

286
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,740
Okay then!

287
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,710
I'll tell you a story about when I
bravely fought Sea Kings in the Calm Belt.

288
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,250
Fought Sea Kings?!

289
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,980
Big ones! They were this big!

290
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,550
O... Our food got away...

291
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,990
But don't worry. You'll be
able to stuff yourself soon.

292
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,450
Really?! What cat will appear this time?!

293
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,400
Vivi! The wind and weather
seem to be becoming stable.

294
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,260
Yes.

295
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,430
We've entered Alabasta's climate area.

296
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,860
A Sea Cat appearing is also the proof.

297
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,390
And what we see behind us...

298
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,830
is probably also proof
of Alabasta being close...

299
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,600
There're so many ships!
When did that happen?!

300
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,560
Hey...! They all have
the Baroque Works' symbol!

301
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,020
Its employees have started gathering...

302
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,860
They're probably Billions...
the Officer Agents' subordinates.

303
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,170
Which means that our
enemy is at least 200...

304
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,870
On top of that, they are the
200 elites of Baroque Works...

305
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,330
They're far from those bounty
hunters in Whisky Peak.

306
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,560
Should we fire at them while we can?!

307
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,090
Let's get on it already!

308
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,560
It's quicker if we go
there and beat them up!

309
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,020
No, wait! We have to eat first!

310
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,980
Idiot! Don't bother. They're small fries.

311
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,880
He's right.

312
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,940
If we lose our real target, that'll be it.

313
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,380
There're only 8 of us.

314
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,510
Anyway, tie it tight.

315
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,950
Our enemy this time
has too many mysteries.

316
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,320
I see...

317
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,910
If we check this, we don't
have to doubt our friends.

318
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:49,110
Does that Clone Clone Fruit guy really
become so similar when he transforms?

319
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,300
You've no idea! It's not "similar."
It's "the same"!

320
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,270
It's too bad! You should've seen it.
We even danced with him.

321
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm not interested in a male ballerina.

322
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,010
Knowing someone like that
is among our enemy,

323
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,700
we can't carelessly act alone.

324
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,660
Hey, what should I do?

325
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,720
Ahh... Do what you can do.
You don't have to do anything more.

326
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,130
It's okay to run away from
the enemy you can't defeat!

327
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,270
Aren't you telling that to yourself?

328
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,480
What I can do, huh?

329
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,420
Got it!

330
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,930
I can see the island now!

331
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,370
Let's stop at the town called Nanohana.
We have to hide the ship.

332
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,170
All right! At any rate,
no matter what happens,

333
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,680
this thing on our left arm is
the sign of our friendship!

334
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,140
Well then, we'll land!

335
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,510
To a restaurant! Oh, and to Alabasta.

336
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,100
It's a side note?

337
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,790
The enemy this time is an
assassination gang, Luffy.

338
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,130
Yeah, it is.

339
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,020
Be careful about acting
on instinct, okay?

340
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,270
You're right. I got it.
Yeah! That's right! Yeah!

341
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,030
Got it!

342
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:24,430
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

343
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

344
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:47,110
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

345
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:57,590
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

346
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

347
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,340
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

348
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

349
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,920
Food! Food! Food!

350
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,480
So this is Alabasta!

351
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,820
It's a town full of life!

352
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,020
It's... quite hot...

353
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,450
The town still seems peaceful.

354
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,790
When will the riot actually occur...?

355
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,530
We have to stop it, right, Vivi-chan?

356
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:37,920
Yes.

357
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,730
Food!

358
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,200
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,870
"Off to the Desert Kingdom! The Rain-
Summoning Powder and the Rebel Army"

360
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,380
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
