Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,060
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,960
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,470
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,230
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,990
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,500
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,500
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,010
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,020
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,370
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,340
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,150
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,240
Hey! I see the mystery mountain!

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,020
What?!

23
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,180
I can't see the top because of the clouds!

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,320
So this is the Red Line!

25
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,330
This can't be for real!

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,680
The damn ocean really is
flowing up the mountain!

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,880
Gum-Gum Balloon!

28
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,730
We made it!

29
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,150
Yahoo!

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,650
We're above the clouds now!

31
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,950
We've made it to the top!

32
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,130
Yahoo!

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,130
All we gotta do now is go down!

34
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,780
So this is the
greatest sea in the world!

35
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,900
The Grand Line!

36
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,250
"The First Line of Defense?
The Giant Whale Laboon Appears"

37
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,870
Whoa!! This is great!!

38
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,890
Did you just hear something?

39
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,480
Huh? What'd you say?

40
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,660
Don't you hear a strange sound?

41
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,230
Isn't it the wind?

42
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,410
There must be lots of unusual landforms!

43
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,650
What's that?

44
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,880
Nami-san! I see a mountain up ahead!

45
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,140
A mountain?! That can't be!

46
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,120
But it's really there!

47
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,410
Who cares?! Go!!

48
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,140
After passing the Twin Capes up ahead,
there should be nothing but ocean!

49
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,650
Hm?

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,570
Oh, crap!!

51
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,010
It's not a mountain!!

52
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,390
It's a black wall!!

53
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,510
No, it's not!!

54
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,630
Then, what is it?!

55
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,890
I-I-I-It's a whale!!

56
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,180
Wh-Wh-Wh-What're we gonna do?!

57
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,000
Shall we fight?

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
Idiot! There's no way we can fight that!

59
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,000
B-B-B-B-But, our path is blocked!

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,660
What're we gonna do?!

61
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,120
Hold on a sec!

62
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,260
If it looks like a wall from this close,

63
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,620
then where are its eyes?!

64
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,970
That's right! It's possible
that he may not have noticed us!

65
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,300
But unless we do something,
we'll run into it!

66
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,340
Hey! We can get through on the left!

67
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Port! Hard to port!

68
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,880
But the rudder is broken!

69
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,480
Do something!

70
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,340
I'll help, too!

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,140
Oh, yeah! I've got an idea!

72
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,560
Luffy...? Hey, what're you doing?!

73
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,440
It doesn't work! The ship doesn't turn!

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,740
Dammit!

75
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
Don't give up!

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,920
Is this it...?!

77
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,590
Cannon?!

78
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,550
All right! Did it stop?

79
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,940
Ah... We're screwed...

80
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,440
This might be it...

81
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,240
My special seat...!

82
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,640
Let's get out of here before it's too late!!

83
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,800
What the heck is going on?!

84
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,320
Did he not notice the cannon
attack because his body's too big?!

85
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,830
Or is he just slow?!

86
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,430
Who knows?! Anyway,
let's get out of here now!

87
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,340
Ahhhhh! My ears hurt!

88
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,040
Paddle! Just paddle!!

89
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,820
We have to get away from him!

90
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,160
Luffy...?

91
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:22,090
You...! What the hell did
you do to my special seat?!

92
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,420
Dumbass!!

93
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,270
How was that?! Bring it on, you bastard!

94
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,810
Shut up already, you idiot!

95
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,570
Wh-What?

96
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,340
--Luffy!
--Luffy!

97
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,510
I'm not gonna die!!

98
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600
What am I gonna do?

99
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,950
They've all been eaten...

100
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey you! Spit them out!
Give everyone back to me!

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,040
Spit them out!
I'm saying give them back!

102
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,850
You...!

103
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,810
You...! You jerk!

104
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,320
You're diving into the water,
aren't you?! Stop it!

105
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,780
Hey! I'm telling you to stop! Hey!

106
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,740
Please wait! Give my friends back!

107
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,700
Hey! I said stop it!

108
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,700
We're gonna go on adventures together!
They're precious to me!

109
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,870
Give them back!!

110
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,440
Huh?

111
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,430
What do you think...?

112
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,430
What do I think...?

113
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,060
How should I think...?

114
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,920
H-H-H-H-How...

115
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,500
I was sure that we were
swallowed by the whale...

116
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,420
Is this a dream?

117
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,990
Yeah, it's probably a dream.

118
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,270
Then, what're the island
and house doing there?

119
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,760
They must be illusions.

120
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,390
Then this is...

121
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,350
...a Great King Squid!!

122
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,660
Looks like there's at least someone there.

123
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,210
I hope it's really a person...

124
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,280
I've had enough. I wanna go home.

125
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,120
Luffy went somewhere, too.
What's gonna happen to us?

126
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,670
Come to think of it, where's Luffy?!

127
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,600
What the heck is this?

128
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,470
Why is there a door and
a passageway in a whale?

129
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,430
A ship...

130
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,720
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shall we fire
the cannon at that island?!

131
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,400
No, hold on a sec...

132
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Someone's coming out...

133
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,890
--Ah?! It's a flower!
--A flower?

134
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,600
Oh, never mind. It's a person.

135
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,110
What is he?

136
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,680
That old man killed a
Great King Squid with a single hit...

137
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,580
Was he just fishing...
or did he do it to save us...?

138
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,270
Say something, you jerk!

139
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,800
I-If you wanna fight,
we'll fight, you bastard!

140
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,490
We've got cannons!

141
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,460
You'd better not, or someone will die.

142
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,340
Oh? Just who're you saying will die?

143
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,800
--Me.
--You?!

144
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
--Why, you...
--Well, calm down.

145
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,880
He's mocking us. That bastard...

146
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,770
Hey, old man. Tell us where
we are and who you are.

147
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,990
When asking someone a question,

148
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,040
isn't it proper manner
to give your name first?

149
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,560
Hm? Yeah, good point. Sorry.

150
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,310
--My name is Roronoa...
--My name is Crocus.

151
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,430
I'm the lighthouse keeper
of the Twin Capes.

152
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,360
I'm 71 years old and a Gemini.

153
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,710
--Can I cut him?!
--My blood type is AB.

154
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,970
--Now, calm down.
--My blood type is AB.

155
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,060
You're asking where we are?

156
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:59,190
How dare you run your mouth when
you barged into my private resort?

157
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,160
Does it look like we're in a rat's belly?

158
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,170
S-So we were eaten by a whale after all...

159
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,870
But is this really inside
a whale's stomach?

160
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,800
Wait a sec! What's gonna happen to us?!

161
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,080
I don't wanna be digested!

162
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,000
Would you cut that out?!

163
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,720
Haven't you guys heard of
the "repeating gag"?

164
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,550
That was a gag?!

165
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,560
The exit is over there.

166
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,010
We can get out?!

167
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,470
Hold on a sec! Why's there
an exit in a whale's belly?!

168
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,780
Why's the door in the sky?!

169
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,440
Wait... Look at it carefully...

170
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,730
This sky... Those seagulls...

171
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,140
They're all painted! It's all a painting
inside of the whale's stomach!

172
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,200
Huh?!

173
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,830
Call it a doctor's playful mind.

174
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,340
You bastard! What the hell
are you doing here?!

175
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,910
That's enough. Leave him alone.

176
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,120
Agreed.

177
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,830
Nami! There's an exit, so
let's get out of here already.

178
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,880
Yeah.

179
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,620
What's going on?!

180
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,760
It's started...

181
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,720
Look!

182
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,220
That's not an island! It's a ship.
On top of that, it's made of iron!

183
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,690
Of course! It's because
this sea is gastric acid!

184
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,400
I guess that means that wooden ships
would melt if they stayed here long.

185
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,550
Hey! What's started?! Tell us!

186
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,780
This whale has...

187
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,700
Laboon has started hitting
his head against the Red Line.

188
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,050
What?!

189
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,160
Come to think of it, this whale
had terrible scars on his forehead.

190
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,390
He was also howling at the sky...

191
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,760
What does that mean?

192
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,220
He's suffering!

193
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,640
I see! So that's what that
geezer's trying to do!

194
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,660
Likely... He's probably trying to
kill the whale from inside his body!

195
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,450
Now...

196
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,880
What a vicious way to kill it...!

197
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,040
Now that the mystery is solved,
it's time to hurry up and get out.

198
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,690
If we take our time here,
we'll be digested.

199
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,990
We have nothing to say
about his whale hunting

200
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,130
nor are we under obligation
to save the whale.

201
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,390
Let's get out of here.

202
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,060
Ahhh! Dammit! With the
waves surging like this,

203
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,330
I don't know if we can
even reach the doors...

204
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,650
We have no other choice but
to paddle! Take the oars!

205
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,640
Let's leave quickly!
I'm worried about Luffy.

206
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,780
He's outside!
I saw him fly out of the mouth!

207
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,600
That old man jumped in!

208
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,350
Huh? What's he gonna do?
He's gonna be digested.

209
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,090
What?! What's going on?! Huh? Why?!

210
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:20,010
Dizzy... Dizzy... I'm dizzy...!

211
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,230
What is it this time?
The sea? A river? A channel?

212
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,760
Okay. We've succeeded
in infiltrating this far.

213
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,260
Listen, Miss Wednesday.

214
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,140
Behind those doors is the stomach
and that geezer is likely to be there.

215
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,720
We must eliminate him.

216
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,640
Everything is for the whale.

217
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:14,110
Yes, Mr. 9. This whale is a
precious sweet honey to our town.

218
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,020
Hey! The geezer came out!

219
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,950
Forget about him.

220
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,420
More importantly,
how do we open these doors?

221
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,540
Okay, Miss Wednesday?

222
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,080
We'll open the doors with
"Three, two, one, baby!"

223
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,150
Don't let down your guard.

224
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,900
Roger, Mr. 9. I'm ready any time.

225
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,850
I can't stop!!

226
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,390
What is this voice, Mr. 9?

227
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,350
I don't know, Miss Wednesday.

228
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,060
Those guys're...

229
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,520
Ahh!

230
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,610
Huh?

231
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,900
This isn't good, Miss Wednesday!
It's a sea of gastric acid below us!

232
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,900
--Luffy?
--Hey! So everyone's okay?

233
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,330
In any case, help me!

234
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,700
Aside from Luffy...
there're two weirdoes...

235
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,920
Hey! That old man disappeared!

236
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,660
Don't bother! For now, let's save Luffy!

237
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,520
Stop it, Laboon.

238
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,110
Don't hurt yourself any more.

239
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,720
There's only a little sedative left.
I have to make some more...

240
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,200
That wall divides the world's oceans.

241
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Even if you hit it until you die,
it won't break, Laboon.

242
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,280
It's calmed down.
The whale is quiet now.

243
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,800
Seems like it. Now...

244
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,190
We did save you guys for the
time being, but who are you?

245
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,990
Mr. 9, they're pirates.

246
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,150
I-I know, Miss Wednesday.

247
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,620
B-But if we talk to them,
they should understand... perhaps...

248
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,120
You thugs're still around?!

249
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,040
--Huh?
--Don't make me say this yet again!

250
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,170
I won't let you lay a finger
on Laboon as long as I'm alive!

251
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,060
He's back.

252
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,540
Who's that pops?

253
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,260
Huh?

254
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,590
Even if you say so, we can't leave.

255
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,220
Taking down this whale is our mission.

256
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,320
We won't let you interfere with
our whale hunting this time!

257
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,110
We'll open an air vent in
his stomach! Let's go, baby!

258
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,900
Roger!

259
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,740
Ah! Bastards!

260
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,290
That pops jumped
straight into the bullets...!

261
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,750
Could it be...
that he protected the whale?!

262
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,890
Stop this pointless resistance!

263
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,920
If you want to protect the
whale that badly, go right ahead.

264
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,630
We'll turn it into food for our town!

265
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,060
What's going on?

266
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,980
Huh?

267
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,150
Luffy...?

268
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,610
I just... felt like hitting them.

269
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,120
I thank you for saving me... but why?

270
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,990
I wasn't trying to save you.
I just didn't like them for some reason.

271
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,030
Huh?

272
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,890
--Say, who are these guys?
--Hey, Luffy! What're you doing?

273
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,370
--What're you doing inside this whale?
--Hey, Luffy! What're you doing?

274
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,950
--What're you doing inside this whale?
--Stop it! Hey, Luffy! Stop it!

275
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,280
--They're thugs from a nearby town.
--Stop it! Hey, Luffy! Stop it!

276
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,060
--They're after whale meat.
--What're you trying to do?
It belongs to someone else.

277
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,400
If they capture Laboon,

278
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,020
it can feed the townspeople
for at least 2-3 years, so...

279
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,440
Laboon?

280
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,340
It's the name of this whale.

281
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,810
It's the world's largest whale,
called the Island Whale,

282
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,490
which live only in the West Blue.

283
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,580
I won't let them have him as food.

284
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,870
There's a reason he keeps
hitting himself on the Red Line

285
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,590
and howling towards Reverse Mountain.

286
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,380
A reason?

287
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:53,130
Yeah. He's a whale with a human heart.

288
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,790
And he's been devotedly
waiting for a certain pirate group...

289
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,920
...for 50 long years...

290
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,870
My overflowing feelings don't connect

291
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,710
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

292
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,630
I'll set off by myself,

293
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:32,300
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

294
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,350
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

295
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,440
Why is it so hot?

296
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:56,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

297
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,750
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

298
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,500
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

299
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,260
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

300
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,910
With you, I can run there

301
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,070
There's a reason he keeps
hitting the Red Line?

302
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,320
What a strange whale...

303
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,750
--So he's a whale with a human heart...
--Okay!

304
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,740
When he says "Okay!" nothing
good usually comes of it.

305
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,700
H-Hey, look!

306
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,780
What's he thinking?

307
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,790
Now how is this?

308
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,790
What're you doing?!

309
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,040
On the next episode of One Piece!

310
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,510
"A Promise Between Men!
Luffy and the Whale Vow to Meet Again"

311
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,790
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
