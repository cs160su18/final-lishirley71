2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,900
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,070
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,130
Blackbeard who acquired Whitebeard's
power now is in a standoff

62
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,490
with the Navy at the plaza!

63
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,030
Meanwhile, Luffy has collapsed
after Ace's death and...

64
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,790
...Jimbei rushes to the bay head
in order to help him escape!

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,630
Let's start with sinking
Marineford into water!

66
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,140
Shock Wave!

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,060
A building can easily be rebuilt!

68
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,490
But the island of Marineford is located
virtually in the center of the world!

69
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:26,370
To protect the people of the world who
are threatened by rampaging villains,

70
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,910
it is important to them that we are here!

71
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,710
Justice that comes from
humanity will never perish!

72
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,500
Don't claim to be able to
sink this place so lightly,

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,760
you little punk!

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,880
Well, then:

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,890
defend this place--if you can!

76
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,350
Destroy them!

77
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,720
Destroy them!

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,140
Destroy them!

79
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,240
Destroy them!!

80
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,560
What's this?!

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,190
I'll have an advantage once we
get to the sea! I can outrun him!

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,240
Oh no! It's frozen!

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,410
Sables!

84
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,560
You gotta protect the one you wanna protect!

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,300
Don't let them have their way!

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,680
What is that?! The ship came out of water!

87
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,100
That's a submarine!

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,060
Whose ship is that?

89
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,610
Put Straw Hat-ya on my ship!

90
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,410
"Straw Hat-ya"? That's really
a strange way to call somebody!

91
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,910
Who the hell are you, brat?!

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,660
I'm gonna help him get out of here.
Let me take care of him for now!

93
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,000
W-What?!

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,900
I'm a doctor!

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,100
"The Desperate Scream! Courageous
Moments that Will Change the Future"

96
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,600
Are you kidding me?! Doctors
don't carry swords!

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,850
Do you visit your patients by submarine?!

98
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,610
What's wrong?! Who is it?!

99
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,820
Trafalgar Law, a rookie from the North Blue!

100
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,150
What?!

101
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,760
That rookie must be Straw
Hat Luffy's accomplice whom

102
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,030
we weren't able to catch when
they had trouble with...

103
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,740
...the Celestial Dragons
in Sabaody Archipelago!

104
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,580
He came to save Luffy by submarine!

105
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,980
You're too slow! Hand him over already!

106
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,550
I said who the hell are you!?

107
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,390
Captain Law! Navy ships are
approaching off the stern!

108
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,810
Hurry up! Put those two on this ship!

109
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,610
I said "move out of my way"!

110
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,870
It's amazing that such rascal
pirates like you guys are...

111
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,520
...risking your lives to protect the son of

112
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,250
the worst criminal - the revolutionary, Dragon!

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,920
Stop undermining the wheels of justice!

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,970
Hound Blaze!

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,840
Stop Akainu here!

116
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,140
I won't let him lay a finger
on Ace's brother again!

117
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,730
Listen all Navy soldiers!

118
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:46,940
Split in two to go after the Whitebeards
and fight the Blackbeards!

119
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,120
Navy soldiers are coming
out from underground!

120
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,330
There were tunnels?!

121
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,370
We have backup! Great!
Let's get them at once!

122
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,480
Hey, Coby?! Aren't you feeling well?!

123
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,770
You're acting weird!

124
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,010
Only the man who reigns over
the Navy could do that!

125
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,350
"Buddha" Sengoku, very powerful.

126
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,480
But that's not enough to
defend the island against me!

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,400
Shut your big mouth already!
And be gone from Marineford!

128
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,330
--B-Blackbeard has...
--...Stopped the shock wave of Fleet Admiral!

129
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,950
Let me give you a hand, Captain!

130
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,430
W-What was that?!

131
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,600
Garp!

132
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,360
I'm a Navy soldier, too.

133
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,320
I have a duty to defend Marineford!

134
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,580
You washed-up old farts!

135
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,870
Take a good look!

136
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,300
Captain, we'll soon be in
range of the Navy ships!

137
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,480
Do something, Bepo!

138
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,640
What?! You're not Captain, you're a newcomer!

139
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,440
They're coming on this side too!

140
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,150
Finish them off with a barrage!

141
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,710
Fire! Fire!

142
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,760
Wh-What is this?!

143
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,050
This is...!

144
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,560
Blackbeard is using the
Tremor-Tremor Fruit power again!

145
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,260
The one he acquired from Whitebeard!

146
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,100
But it's way more powerful than before
when he destroyed the HQ building!

147
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,120
Not only the ground! The sky and
the sea... Everything is shaking!

148
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,560
What wonderful power!

149
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,610
I won't let you get away!

150
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,740
You can't go any further!

151
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,290
Not again!

152
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,630
Stop the Navy soldiers here! Let as many
of our people get away as possible!

153
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,460
No way! We won't let
even one of you get away!

154
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,890
You just put on another great show!

155
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,850
But I can't control the power very well yet!

156
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,230
Hey, Captain! If you aren't careful, we'll
lose the ground we're standing on, too!

157
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,690
Blackbeard, you bastard!

158
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:47,240
Whitebeard would be horrified to
know this punk is using his power!

159
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,730
How was it, "Buddha"
Sengoku?! Garp the hero?!

160
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,870
Do you think you can stop me?!

161
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,590
Your time ended with Whitebeard's death!

162
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,560
What will Blackbeard do next?!

163
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,940
--I'm scared!
--He's terrifying!

164
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,440
Urgent! After the earthquake
that hit Marineford,

165
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,360
a tsunami warning has issued for the
south shore of Sabaody Archipelago.

166
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,120
In order to avoid widespread panic, please
remain calm before taking any action.

167
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,330
Run!

168
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,630
Please evacuate to the north side -
the elevated area of Grove 40, 50.

169
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,710
Move! What are you doing?!

170
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,050
I'm a nobleman! I'll pay
you to let me go first!

171
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,760
Everybody, please stay cool.

172
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,180
The Pacifistas are getting
over the crack in the plaza!

173
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,460
Follow the Pacifistas! Don't
let the pirates get away! Go!

174
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,010
H-Hey!

175
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,300
You guys should go ahead and get on the ship!

176
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,350
But...

177
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,470
Did you forget Pops' order?!

178
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,500
We gotta get back to the New World
with as many alive as we can!

179
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,270
I got it!

180
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,110
Alright, stay with me!

181
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,900
We won't let you go! None of you can survive!

182
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,490
Pops, I'm sorry! I'm gonna disobey
your order for the first time!

183
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,580
I'm gonna die here!

184
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,710
Me, too! I'm gonna follow Pops to heaven!

185
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,210
Finally, it stopped shaking!

186
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,930
What's the matter with you?!

187
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,090
I don't know! I feel sad!

188
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,140
Sad?!

189
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:32,490
The voices disappear one by one in my head!

190
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,600
Huh? The voices?

191
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,290
--We'll show you the justice of the Navy!
--Is this what you call "justice"?!

192
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,130
Stop the Navy soldiers here!

193
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,800
No way! Destroy the pirates!

194
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,110
That's for my friend who
got killed in the war!

195
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,820
Damn pirates! Go to hell...

196
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,330
Let's teach them!

197
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,870
We're the ones that will conquer
the world, not the pirates!

198
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,880
I got one!

199
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,460
What are you talking about?!

200
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,500
Are you losing your mind?!
Get ahold of yourself!

201
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,290
H-Help me!

202
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,710
Run!

203
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,850
Coby! H-Hey! Where are you going?!

204
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,520
Let as many of our people escape as possible!

205
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,020
Stay with me! He's alive!
Let's get him treated!

206
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,980
I-I don't wanna die!

207
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,110
Forget about him! The war is not over yet.

208
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,490
But...

209
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,740
Now is our chance to show them
the power of our justice!

210
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,580
There's no time to help the wounded! Go!

211
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,750
Y-Yes, sir!

212
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,500
Corner the pirates! Destroy
them--to the last man!

213
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,200
Somebody, give me a hand! Somebody!

214
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,220
Destroy all the damn pirates!

215
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,060
The Navy soldiers are still motivated
even though we achieved the goal!

216
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,730
Guns don't work!

217
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,400
--Run!
--Run!

218
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,530
--Chase them!
--Damn villains!

219
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,080
Something is not right! With either side!

220
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,910
We're not satisfied even though we won!

221
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,520
Damn!

222
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,160
Listen, guys!

223
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,070
As long as you're a Navy soldier, you
can't forgive those thugs, the pirates!

224
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,240
Curiel!

225
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,450
Admiral Sakazuki!

226
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,800
Hey, are you alright?!

227
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,720
H-Hey!

228
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,620
No one can stop me! I'm gonna
destroy and devour everything!

229
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,930
B-Blackbeard! He's pretty scary!

230
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,310
I gotta leave here as soon as possible!

231
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,320
Why don't you leave Straw Hat Luffy here?

232
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,620
Ugh! It's...!

233
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,450
--It's Kizaru!
--Get them on the ship!

234
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,080
Alright, I leave them
to you, Whoever You Are!

235
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,560
Do the best you can!

236
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,210
Catch them, Jean Bart!

237
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,670
Yeah, that's it!

238
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,340
Submerge!

239
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,680
How dare you get away from
us at Sabaody, Trafalgar Law?

240
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,920
He's severely wounded! Is he alive?!

241
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,020
Let's run!

242
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,480
Dammit!

243
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,110
Give it up!

244
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,130
That's enough!

245
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,410
A Navy soldier?

246
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,550
Coby!

247
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,260
Let's end this now!

248
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,970
Let's not fight anymore!

249
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,550
What is he doing?

250
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,810
S-Somebody...

251
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,940
H-Help me!

252
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,670
We're wasting people's lives!

253
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:04,570
Every single soldier has a family
that's waiting for him to come home!

254
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,450
We accomplished the purpose already

255
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,990
but we're still chasing the pirates
who have no will to fight!

256
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,800
We could stop but we're coveting more!

257
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,280
We're giving up on our soldiers

258
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,420
who could survive if we
treated them right away!

259
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,380
On top of that, we keep multiplying
the number of victims!

260
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,840
Soldiers who're gonna go down after this...

261
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,970
Is that Coby?

262
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,020
They're no more than fools!

263
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,730
Who are you, you fool?!

264
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,440
You've wasted my time!

265
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,080
We have no use for a soldier
who doesn't believe in justice!

266
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,120
Oh no, I'm dead! But I
said what I wanted to say!

267
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,870
I have no regret!

268
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,830
Coby!

269
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,890
Good job, you young Navy soldier.

270
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,110
The courageous moments that you
created by risking your life

271
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,940
just now have changed...

272
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,240
...the future of the world
tremendously - for better or worse.

273
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,990
Hurry up! Bring him inside!

274
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,240
Not a chance!

275
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,250
Don't do anything, Kizaru!

276
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,040
Oops, you're Benn Beckman!

277
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,630
Huh? That's...! The ship is...!

278
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,090
Let's go!

279
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,390
Why is one of The Four Emperors
from the New World here?!

280
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,390
"Red-Haired" Shanks!

281
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,240
I'm here to...

282
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,950
...end this war!

283
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,960
The "Red-Haired" Pirates have
appeared out of the blue!

284
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,920
Law tries to give Luffy a chance to escape
while the Navy catches their breath,

285
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,130
but the three admirals attack relentlessly.

286
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:40,100
Then Shanks reveals his real reason
for appearing on the battlefield...

287
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

288
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,100
"Here Comes Shanks! The War
of the Best is Finally Over!"

289
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
