2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,320
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
The feelings of those who are in anguish

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,050
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

22
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,560
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,960
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,280
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

25
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,370
Nami engaged in mortal combat

26
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,080
with Miss Doublefinger,
who has Spike Spike Fruit powers,

27
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,670
and was overwhelmingly dominated by her.

28
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,590
However, Usopp's invention, the Clima Takt,
gradually began to show it's true power.

29
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,200
Meanwhile, Crocodile appeared at the palace

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,180
and finally began to reveal the
ultimate goal behind his ambitions

31
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,520
in front of Vivi and Cobra.

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,720
"Secret Passed Down in the Royal Family!
The Ancient Weapon Pluton"

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,090
What's he talking about?
What's Pluton? What on earth is he...

34
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,020
I hear that one shot from Pluton
will completely destroy an island.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,560
The world's most disastrous weapon
from ancient times, also called a god.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,860
It should be sleeping
somewhere in this country.

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,940
An ancient weapon? Such a
thing exists in this country...?

38
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,280
And Father knew about it...?

39
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,450
A secret passed down with the throne...

40
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,310
That's been my goal from the start.

41
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,630
With it, I'll be able to build
the best military state right here.

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,260
In order to achieve that,
all this time you've been...!

43
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Once I become the king of this country,

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,430
it's easy to bring pirates in
this area under my umbrella.

45
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,190
My influence will increase,

46
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,660
and I will eventually gain more power
than even the World Government.

47
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,770
It'll be a dreamlike country.

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,610
There's no way that the World
Government would allow that!

49
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,740
They probably wouldn't. That's why
I need it... the powerful Pluton...

50
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,520
I don't know where on earth
you heard that name,

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,580
but I don't know where it is

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,540
and I'm not even certain such a thing
really exists somewhere in this country.

53
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,820
I see. What you say
probably isn't a complete lie...

54
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,280
I did think that that was also possible...

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,520
I do know, too, that its
very existence is in doubt.

56
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,950
What noisy flies...

57
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,560
I heard that Cobra-sama has
been crucified by Crocodile.

58
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,060
Save Cobra-sama!

59
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,120
We have to do our utmost
to get inside somehow!

60
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,960
But we can't do anything because of
those hands coming out from the door!

61
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,740
It's impossible unless we do
something about those hands!

62
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,450
According to my plan,

63
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,350
the rebel army will reach that Square
within 20 minutes or so and start fighting.

64
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,060
After that... in other words,
at 4:30 pm, 30 minutes from now...

65
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,460
...I've ordered that a powerful
cannonball be shot into the Square.

66
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,820
Are you insane?!

67
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,330
It's a special shell that can destroy
anything within a 5 km diameter.

68
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,790
The view from here will
completely change, too.

69
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,750
If you do that...

70
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,420
No one from either the royal army
or the rebel army will survive.

71
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,710
Hence, the battle will be ceased forever.

72
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,850
Aren't you happy? After all,
you wanted to stop them so badly...

73
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,140
Instead of doing things in a roundabout
way, like blowing up the palace,

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,230
it'll be quicker if we just
completely blow up both the armies.

75
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,650
How can you do such a thing?!

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,480
What on earth did they
do to you to deserve it?!

77
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,530
--You are... You are...
--Vivi-sama!

78
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,120
Who cares...?

79
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,780
Stop it! What good will it do?!

80
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,770
Vivi-sama!

81
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,840
Now, Mr. Cobra. Let me
ask you another question.

82
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,720
Where can I find the Poneglyph?

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,680
Poneglyph... Why are you...

84
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,970
If I tell you where it is...

85
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,730
No... I'll show you...

86
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,690
Daddy...

87
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,400
Just what I'd expect from a wise king,
Cobra. You're a clever man.

88
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,870
Vivi-sama!

89
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,640
I can't... take this any more!

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,190
No!

91
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,640
Listen, Nami. How you use the Clima Takt
comes down to your head after all.

92
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,150
Think frantically to survive the battle!

93
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,150
That's our real weapon, right?

94
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,310
Heat Balls and Cool Balls...

95
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,270
All I have to do is take full advantage of
their characteristics and combine them!

96
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,870
That's the power of the Clima Takt!

97
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,720
And one last thing... Tornado Tempo...!
This is the centerpiece of this weapon.

98
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,510
Tornado Tempo...

99
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,890
As long as your enemy is human, they
won't be able to stand after being hit.

100
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,360
However, this is the very last resort
and you only get one shot.

101
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,430
If you miss, consider it over.

102
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,690
If I miss, it's over...

103
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,860
Pay attention.

104
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,050
It seems that you have
an interesting weapon.

105
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,370
But if it doesn't have practical
attacks, isn't it just a toy?

106
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,340
Whatever its purpose is,
you can call it... a weapon...

107
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,740
...when it can harm people...

108
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,980
If I don't hurry up, I'll be killed...
The last powerful technique...

109
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,390
Tornado Tempo... I have to do it now...!

110
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,400
G-Give that back to me!

111
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,550
You can't kill me with a toy like this.

112
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,860
A sweater can probably produce
better electricity than this.

113
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,950
We won't know until I try! Give it back to me!

114
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,980
Think!

115
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,070
All I have to do is get her to drop
her guard so that she can't dodge

116
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,420
this one-shot attack,
the Tornado Tempo...! Maybe...!

117
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,870
Something that I can do by using

118
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,390
the three kinds of air bubbles and the
extremely dry weather of this country...!

119
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,890
I wish there were at least a little
more moisture in the air...

120
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,850
Moisture... That's right! If I remember
correctly, there's a rain technique...

121
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,530
Rain Tempo!

122
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,240
Water tricks, huh?

123
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,070
Sprinkler!

124
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,530
You're desperate, aren't you?

125
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,420
No! I have a plan!

126
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,250
That's enough. I've had
enough of your party tricks.

127
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,210
The party is at its height. Let's call it quits.

128
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,250
A sea urchin?!

129
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,470
Sea Urchin Stinger!

130
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
I'll make you Swiss cheese!

131
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,110
That's not what I'd call
Swiss cheese! It's even burnt!

132
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,990
In appreciation of your show earlier,
I'll show you something interesting, too.

133
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,590
Now's my chance! Heat Ball!

134
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,940
Hot air goes upwards
while absorbing moisture.

135
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,240
When it collides with cold air that's
descending, it rapidly cools

136
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
and the moisture gets frozen.

137
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,100
Then...

138
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,110
Spike Spike Doping!

139
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,820
I said pay attention, didn't I?!

140
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,240
Stinger Flail!

141
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,710
Oh... these wounds are nothing...

142
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,930
Everyone's fighting with their very lives.

143
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,020
Even if my arms get torn off
or my nose gets broken, I will...

144
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,900
If you talk too much,
you'll cause internal bleeding.

145
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,730
I know!

146
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,490
So you're still alive for now.

147
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,200
Sanji!

148
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,870
Those wounds...

149
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,620
So, how'd the battle with Mr. 2 turn out?

150
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,380
Of course! Here...

151
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,250
Ahhh! My goggles!

152
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,800
So you took them back
from him! Thanks, Sanji!

153
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,560
You're such a... Ahh!
Hey, wait a sec! They're broken!

154
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,110
You bastard! This is the newest
model in the North Blue!

155
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,560
Do you know how valuable
these goggles are?

156
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,200
Hey, look at that.

157
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,760
Listen to me...

158
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,690
Ah!

159
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,120
That must be the auxiliary
force for the rebel army.

160
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,360
So there'll be more of them?

161
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,630
Looks like it. I guess Vivi-chan
couldn't stop the rebel army...

162
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,480
Ah, dammit!

163
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,830
Hm? Vaaa?

164
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,420
Hey, where have you been hiding, Lashes?!

165
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,010
Let's hurry to the palace. We might
still be able to help Vivi-chan.

166
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,620
--Okay!
--Hey, Usopp! Let's go already!

167
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,020
Y-Yeah...! Ah, hey, Lashes! Let me get on!

168
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,090
Look! Can't you see these wounds?

169
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,060
Lashes! Stop! Let me get on!

170
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,140
Geez, at least you're a first-class
expert at running away...

171
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,700
Oh, yeah! The air bubbles!

172
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,710
It's formed! It's small, but it's still a cloud!

173
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,000
What on earth are you talking about?

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,390
Not enough...! I'll let it grow more!

175
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,240
Cool Ball!

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,220
Heat Ball!

177
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,810
That's enough!

178
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,980
You bitch!

179
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,860
Stinger... Flail!

180
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,080
So, are you prepared to die yet?

181
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,570
How about you?

182
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,190
Stop bluffing...

183
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,800
Take that!

184
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,490
You won't get away with this!

185
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,420
What?!

186
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,460
It'll be a fine day today
with stable humidity and wind

187
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,430
as well as a high-pressure system.

188
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,190
However, in one particular area, you
need to watch for mirages and cyclones.

189
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,090
Please be on the lookout for tornados.

190
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,570
Tornado Tempo... This is the
centerpiece of this weapon.

191
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,250
This is the very last resort
and you only get one shot.

192
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,280
If you miss, consider it over.

193
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,380
If I miss, it's over...

194
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,230
The weather forecast is tornado!

195
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,190
I'll make it work... the last attack...

196
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,180
...since I wanted to fight with
my own hands... for her...!

197
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,680
Nami-san... Don't die...

198
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,660
At least try putting all of our
lives on the line together!

199
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,940
Aren't we friends?!

200
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,160
Oh, you can cry those kinds of tears...

201
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,220
I know you actually hate this
and want to beat him up the most!

202
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,560
Sometimes, it calls forth clouds...
other times, it makes rain fall...

203
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,370
Yet other times, it produces winds...!

204
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,380
The miraculous Clima Takt! I'll make it work!

205
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,390
The last powerful technique! For Vivi!

206
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,020
Are you okay?

207
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,780
Your left leg has taken lots of injuries...

208
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,260
You can't actually keep
standing any more, can you?

209
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,380
Sea Urchin Stinger!

210
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,650
This is... nothing...!

211
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,520
It doesn't hurt at all!

212
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,980
Do you have any idea what
pain she's going through?!

213
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,640
Compared to her pain...

214
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,040
...a leg or two, or three...

215
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,830
I don't give a damn!

216
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,950
Take this... Tornado Tempo!

217
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,250
What? What? What? What?!

218
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,130
The doves tangled up on me...!

219
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,520
Ow...

220
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,500
I did it... I did it! Usopp... Vivi...!

221
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,750
"Alubarna - North Block"

222
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,130
"Alubarna - North Block"
"Battle behind the Mehdi Assembly Hall"

223
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,470
"Alubarna - North Block"
"Battle behind the Mehdi Assembly Hall"
"Winner: Nami"

224
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,770
Oh, yeah...

225
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,120
Now I remember... your face...
It's in my fuzzy memory.

226
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,990
If I'm not mistaken, you were a famous
bounty hunter in the West Blue... right?

227
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,860
Also known as an assassin...

228
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,450
But look at you now...

229
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,450
What do you fight for?
You're Crocodile's dog!

230
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,380
Are you doing it in order to at least get
some nice scraps by licking his hand?

231
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,030
You son of a bitch.

232
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,380
I'll show you... the difference in pride...

233
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,260
...between your swords and mine...!

234
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,810
Three-Sword Style...

235
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,310
Bull... Needles!

236
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,860
Spider...

237
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,260
So basically, your body is hard as steel.

238
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,390
Unless I'm capable of cutting
even steel, I can't cut you down, huh?

239
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,340
That would be correct.

240
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,490
Smashing and cutting
attacks don't work on me.

241
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
I see. This bites.

242
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,560
Since I'm not yet capable of
cutting steel, I can't defeat you now.

243
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,510
Humph... Then what're you going to do?

244
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,030
Well, I'll sympathize with you.

245
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,240
What?

246
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,590
I've been waiting for a
difficult situation like this.

247
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,340
I've been thinking that it's about
time for me to go to the next level.

248
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,700
When I defeat you,

249
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,940
I'll be a man who can even cut steel.

250
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,760
I always wanted to talk about it

251
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,310
I couldn't even say half of it

252
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:41,820
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

253
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:54,540
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

254
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,680
Glory glory you're my shine

255
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:06,440
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

256
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,200
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

257
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,700
I'm sure I'll make it there

258
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,460
I swore on that day that
I would never lose again.

259
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,720
But how large the wall standing
in front of me right now is!

260
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,890
When you can't even give me a scratch,
there's only one way left for you.

261
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,080
Only death.

262
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,340
What the hell do I lack?!

263
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,000
On the next episode of One Piece!

264
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,070
"Secret of Powerful Swordplay! Ability to
Cut Steel and the Rhythm Things Have"

265
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
