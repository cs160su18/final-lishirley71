00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,910
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,770
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,310
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,370
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,370
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,600
Demon Aura... Nine-Sword Style...

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,570
...Asura!

36
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,580
Sky Slicer!

37
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,170
Hardships are fine by me!

38
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,370
I choose to walk the path of Asura!

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,340
Asura... Silver Mist!

40
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,430
Second Gear.

41
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,890
Jet Whip!

42
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,860
Shave!

43
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:41,860
Finger Pistol!

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,700
Gum-Gum...

45
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,370
--Iron Body!
--...Jet Bazooka!

46
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,960
Franky!

47
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,420
Please save Robin!

48
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,860
Just super leave it to me!

49
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,140
You bitch! You still don't get it?!
I said this is useless!

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,680
How many times do I have to tell you?!

51
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,520
There's no hope left for you!

52
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,090
I'm not going anywhere!

53
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,400
They'll all come to rescue me for sure!

54
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,300
"Spandam Frightened!
The Hero on the Tower of Law"

55
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,150
H-Hey, look at that!
I've never seen this before!

56
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,610
Yeah... I've never even heard
anyone talking about it!

57
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,500
To see that the Gates of Justice
have completely opened!

58
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,580
It's so that the battleships from
Headquarters can come here!

59
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,580
It's for the Buster Call's cannon attack!

60
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,380
Granny Kokoro surely said

61
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,010
that those doors never
open all the way, and yet...

62
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,770
What's this air of intimidation?
What on earth is Buster Call?

63
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,150
The Straw Hats picked a fight with the world.

64
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,240
So they really are going to blow them
away along with the entire island!

65
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,020
Bastards!

66
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,210
Don't die, Bro!

67
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,480
Yeah!

68
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,180
Come back alive!

69
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,750
Straw Hat!

70
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,550
I entrusted Franky with saving Robin.

71
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,140
It was careless of me. I never
expected him to be this powerful.

72
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,400
It seems that you're really out of breath.

73
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,640
Isn't it because of that steam?

74
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,490
Defeating you is all that matters.

75
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,570
I see... You're tough.

76
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,330
I'd better make it!

77
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,290
Don't go yet, Nico Robin!

78
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,900
You look so stupid!

79
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,230
That's because of your pointless
resistance, you dumb woman!

80
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,170
Now, stand up!

81
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,880
I said, stand up!

82
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,180
Seriously, the gate is right there, and yet
you're causing me all sorts of trouble!

83
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,240
Guards! Go outside!

84
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Yes, sir!

85
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,250
Guards at the Gates of Justice,

86
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,420
and marines on the escort ship
sent by Navy Headquarters...!

87
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,950
Cipher Pol's Chief Spandam is currently
taking a criminal of utmost importance

88
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,840
across the bridge from the Tower of Law.

89
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,900
All line up and salute!

90
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,520
Yes, sir!

91
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,260
Look at that. They're all ready to set sail now.

92
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,110
There's no longer anything standing in my way.

93
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,450
Oh, yeah, Nico Robin.

94
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,040
I'll let you in on a little secret.

95
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,300
Before we crossed the bridge,
I turned on the landmine

96
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,780
set on the upper part of the
stairs that we just ascended.

97
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,310
If, by any chance, someone
tries to make their way here,

98
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,720
they and the stairs will both go boom!

99
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,340
What do you think? Isn't that interesting?

100
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,620
But, well, don't worry about it,

101
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,530
since no one's gonna make
it to those stairs anyway.

102
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,320
But I won't go through... the gate...

103
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,010
Huh?

104
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,590
...because they said they'd rescue me.

105
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,630
No one will come, you dumb woman!

106
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,720
Everyone will burn to death in
the raging fire of Buster Call!

107
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,480
It'll even erase the utter humiliation of the fact
that pirates shot through our sacred flag!

108
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,490
Just like in Ohara twenty years ago,
when that giant marine attacked us.

109
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,380
Now, walk!

110
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,450
Walk with your own two feet!

111
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,030
Saul...

112
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,200
You bitch!

113
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,630
Chief! Please hurry!

114
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,130
I know! Shut up! I'm a hero!

115
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,090
You probably think that I don't
know anything about it, don't you?

116
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,180
The misconduct by Jaguar D. Saul,
a former Navy Headquarters Vice Admiral!

117
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:47,140
Your mother, Olvia...
What happened in Ohara at that time...

118
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
I know about it all!

119
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,960
Why do you think that is?

120
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,630
That's because I was told.

121
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,950
The one who commanded a raid on
the land of Ohara, where devils lived,

122
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,950
exposed their terrible crime
and issued a Buster Call

123
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,540
was my old man, then-CP9 Chief Spandine!

124
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,980
Well, scholars of Ohara!

125
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,550
Your death sentence has now been decided!

126
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,560
Eliminate him!

127
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,900
Professor!

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,360
Ohara has...

129
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,830
...come to know too much.

130
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,870
I'll initiate a Buster Call!

131
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,920
Take care of the rest.

132
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,930
Now, go, Saul!

133
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,250
Are you sure about this?

134
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:06,960
Yes.

135
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,410
No! I'll stay here, too! Mom!

136
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,080
Mom!

137
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,880
I was happy to hear you call me that.

138
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,940
Thank you!

139
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,540
From now on, for you and me both...

140
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,070
Live, Robin!

141
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,960
They all thought that everyone
in Ohara at that time died, but...

142
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,680
...the Government missed
one brat who escaped then.

143
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,340
How was it?

144
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,010
Who knows how many times this
eight-year-old brat almost got killed

145
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,350
by adults who wanted money...?

146
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,190
You couldn't trust anyone who came near you.

147
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,320
You had nowhere you could sleep safe
and sound. You didn't have food, either.

148
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,870
I don't even wanna imagine how crappy
the last twenty years were for you.

149
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,210
So you were so unhappy it'd make you cry?

150
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,830
The person who put a bounty
on your head twenty years ago...

151
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,640
...was my old man!

152
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,420
He did it for world peace!

153
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,520
Now, after twenty years...
his son hunts down the only survivor,

154
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,430
and the battle of Ohara comes to an end.

155
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,190
Ohara lost!

156
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,740
Robin! Be proud, Robin!

157
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,740
Your mom is honorable! Ohara is honorable!

158
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,430
Someday, pass down this
island's history, Robin!

159
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,060
Ohara fought against the world!

160
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,760
Not while I'm still alive!

161
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,050
But you're gonna die, aren't you?! Right?!

162
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,900
Whoa! What?!

163
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,450
C-Cutty Flam! What is he doing here?!

164
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,780
But that's okay. He fell for it! How stupid!

165
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,930
That idiot got caught in the landmine!

166
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,130
He came to rescue me!

167
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,800
Oops. This isn't good. It was
good that I made doubly sure.

168
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,420
We've gotta hurry. Come!

169
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,390
I can't even put it in words...

170
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,350
Hey! Set sail, marines! I'm gonna jump on!

171
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,400
Y-Yes, sir! Roger!

172
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,820
We're setting sail!

173
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,480
Yes, sir!

174
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,440
I'm so angry that I can't stop my tears!

175
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,540
Just watch carefully!

176
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,790
This is the first step of a hero
that will be engraved in histo...

177
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,340
Just watch carefully!

178
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,700
This is the first step of a hero
that will be engraved in histo...

179
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,790
Wha-cha houie ouchie owow!

180
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,500
Are you okay, Chief?!

181
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,960
What was that?! Who did this?!

182
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,480
There's no one on the bridge!

183
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,210
There must be! They must be
hiding somewhere! Find them!

184
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,270
Where are they?!

185
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,370
Hey! What're you guys doing?!
Why aren't you attacking?!

186
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,230
But, Chief, we can't find the enemy!

187
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,820
Ah! There he is!

188
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,210
Run with all your might!

189
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,920
You'll die if you stay on the island!
Sail out on my raft!

190
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,760
What about you, Saul?

191
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,130
This is it for me. I got caught.

192
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,230
--Go!
--No! There's no one on the sea!

193
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,640
Listen carefully, Robin!

194
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,530
You're alone now, but you'll
meet friends someday for sure!

195
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,200
Friends?

196
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,940
Right. The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...

197
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,170
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!

198
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,490
No one is born into this world to be alone!

199
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,300
Run, Robin! Don't look back!

200
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:40,160
When you're having a hard time,
laugh like this, just like I taught you!

201
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,390
Watch out, Saul!

202
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,060
Ice Time.

203
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,610
Saul!

204
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,930
Go meet the friends
who're surely waiting for you

205
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,030
somewhere at sea, Robin!

206
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,120
Live together with them.

207
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,340
Chief! Please look at that!

208
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,200
Huh?! What?! Where?!

209
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,010
Ahh!

210
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,190
On top of the Tower of Law...!

211
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,030
Tower of Law?! What can
he do from that far away?!

212
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,990
--Snap!
--Who the hell is that?!

213
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,500
--♪ I was born... ♪
--He's aiming at us from that distance
without the slightest error, in this wind?!

214
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,020
--♪ ...on the island of snipers ♪
--Who the hell is that?!

215
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,460
Long-nose!

216
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,910
See that?! Our sniper is amazing, isn't he?!

217
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,720
--♪ Or even your heart... ♪
--Damn well serves them right!

218
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,750
Robin-chan! Run!

219
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,530
♪ ...lock on!! ♪

220
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,310
Does he really have to sing?

221
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,890
How dare you...?!

222
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,690
Chief!

223
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,800
Dammit! What're you guys doing?!
Shoot him dead already!

224
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,700
We're trying, but our bullets won't
reach that far, much less hit him!

225
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,660
That sniper's got really incredible skills!

226
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,040
Nico Robin is getting away!

227
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,280
Don't let her get away!
Idiots! You can shoot her!

228
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,470
--Yes, sir!
--Shoot her dead enough to keep her alive!

229
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,130
Huh?!

230
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,310
Fire!

231
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,660
What?!

232
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,290
What?!

233
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,640
What the hell is he?!

234
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,650
You are...

235
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,570
My body is strong because it's iron.

236
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,110
That landmine wasn't nice, Spanda!

237
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,400
Eek!

238
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,580
Well... Franky-kun, Franky-kun.
This is Sogeking.

239
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,550
Hm? Oh? This transponder
snail is supposed to...

240
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,410
I got it from Nami.

241
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,910
More importantly, you should find a
red cloth bundle on the ground near you.

242
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,380
Red cloth?

243
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,710
Yeah, I see it!

244
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,970
It's got two keys in it.

245
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,680
Together with your keys,
you should have all the keys.

246
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,640
All the keys?!

247
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,350
I delivered them to you without fail.

248
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,770
Mission accomplished.

249
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,020
Let's hurry. This isn't good.

250
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,660
#1...

251
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,110
#3...

252
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,740
#4... Doesn't work!

253
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,630
#5!

254
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,660
They came off!

255
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,500
Not possible! Th-They're the real keys?!

256
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,710
Hey, hey... Pull yourself together!

257
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,100
Oh, no... Does this mean...

258
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:46,140
Ahhh! You guys defeated everyone
in CP9 in the Tower of Law?!

259
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,790
No, that can't be true!

260
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,440
You must've stolen them and run! Dammit!

261
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,030
This is Franky! Hey, Long-nose!

262
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,030
I got the handcuffs off of Nico Robin.

263
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,530
All right!

264
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,080
Thank you, Long-nose!

265
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,670
You can thank those who fought hard
to gather the keys when this is all over.

266
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,770
You are, without a doubt,
one of Luffy-kun's gang!

267
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,510
You can now do as you wish!

268
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,680
Yes.

269
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,350
Seis... Fleurs!

270
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,810
What?! What's going on?!

271
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,430
Slap!

272
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,900
Whoa...

273
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,820
I'll do this to my heart's content.

274
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,360
Chief!

275
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,760
Okay, guys! Hurry up and get over here!

276
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,220
I'll get things ready for our escape!

277
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,970
Roger!

278
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,930
Come down already, Sogeking!

279
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,860
This is bad! The Sea Prism Stone
handcuffs are off of the criminal!

280
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,560
Capture her again!

281
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,020
Everything went according to my plan.

282
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,200
Hm? What's that?

283
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,790
Did I hear something just now?

284
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,500
I don't care if my body falls apart.

285
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,720
I'll do whatever I can do!

286
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,180
That's not really smart.

287
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,810
That technique of yours is
shortening your life, you know that?

288
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,480
You're too ambitious!

289
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

290
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
"Robin Freed! Luffy vs. Lucci,
Showdown Between Leaders"

291
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,010
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
