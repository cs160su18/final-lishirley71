2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,150
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,950
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,870
Inside the bay, Luffy and the Whitebeards
are trying to get to the scaffold

62
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,540
but the Navy stands in their
way. The battle is heating up!

63
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,760
Why did any of them come?!

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,800
I deserve this! They don't have
to risk their lives for me!

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,590
Don't do this!

66
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,100
Everyone! Why are you doing
this for a guy like me?!

67
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,900
I'm your brother!

68
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,820
Kuma! Kuma, that's enough!

69
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,360
It's me! Did you forget my face?!

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,200
If you don't stop, I'm gonna fight
back although I'm a gentle person!

71
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,790
I don't know how you know him
but you may as well give up!

72
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,170
It's no use talking to him, Emporio Ivankov,

73
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,250
commander of the Revolutionaries army!

74
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,010
You...! What do you mean?!
What's wrong with him?!

75
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,010
You're a friend of
Bartholomew Kuma I suppose.

76
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,930
He was once called Tyrant
Kuma and now he is...

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,650
...dead.

78
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,820
Your power is not enough to beat me!

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,990
Damn! Get your jutte off of me!

80
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,030
You! Leave him alone!

81
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,830
She got me although my body is smoke!

82
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,330
Th-That's...! The pirate
empress saved Straw Hat!

83
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,490
Hancock! What are you doing?!

84
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,290
Are you gonna resign from The Warlords, too?!

85
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,670
Shut up! I'm deafened by my own anger!

86
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,050
How could you hit and pin down my beloved?!

87
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:36,850
I won't let you survive! I have
never felt this much anger before!

88
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,150
I'm gonna cut you up and feed you to beasts!

89
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,530
That's the Haki of Kuja!

90
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,800
"Kuma's Transformation!
Ivan-san's Blow of Anger!"

91
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,290
Wh-What's going on here?

92
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,300
Why did the pirate empress save Straw Hat?

93
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,160
No, she didn't save him! She's
gonna turn Straw Hat to stone!

94
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,000
I always believed that
you'd make it here alive.

95
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,210
Take this.

96
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,220
It's your brother's handcuff key.

97
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,050
What?!

98
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,050
That's how diabolical the empress is!

99
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,560
Straw Hat can't move now!

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,930
Has he turned into stone?

101
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,040
Hancock!

102
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,440
You just said my name again!

103
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,530
Luffy's hands... Luffy's hands touched mine!

104
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,950
Hancock!

105
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,790
Yeah!

106
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,420
You're so...! You're so...!

107
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,970
Thank you! I mean it!

108
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,770
N-No... No problem...! Never
mind me, you've got to...

109
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,980
You've got to keep going, Luffy!

110
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,640
You're right!

111
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,190
Thanks!

112
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,620
No way! He beat the pirate empress?!

113
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,330
He must've fought back and thrown
his weight high into her!

114
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,930
See? She looks so tortured!

115
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,600
He beat The Warlord so easily!
How strong, Straw Hat Luffy!

116
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,730
Like that! Like that!

117
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,060
Like that!

118
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,450
I wasn't expect him to hold
me so tight like that!

119
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,560
I can still feel Luffy's body
in my arms and on my chest!

120
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,670
Is this...

121
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,920
Is this...

122
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,380
Is this what they call...

123
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,850
...marriage?!

124
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,310
Snake Princess-sama!

125
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,810
Congratulation, Big Sis!

126
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,070
Snake Princess-sama!

127
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,700
So beautiful!

128
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,290
Best wishes to you!

129
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,270
Luffy!

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,380
Hancock. You look very beautiful.

131
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,840
H-A-P-P-Y!

132
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,470
I'll make you happy for
the rest of your life.

133
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,520
Honey.

134
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,850
Yes!

135
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,730
Honey...

136
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,980
Honey...

137
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,110
Honey...

138
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,610
Honey...

139
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,410
Honey!

140
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,080
Luffy! I see it! I can see it!

141
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,750
A string that links us together!

142
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,170
A string that no one can ever cut!

143
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,680
It's a thick red string
of fate like a big snake!

144
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,790
Luffy!

145
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,890
I won't let you get away, Straw Hat!

146
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,520
Perfume Femur!

147
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,820
You outrageous fool, stand back!

148
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,830
I won't let you pass through here!

149
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,040
Look! She's really looking down on him!

150
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
Looking down too much makes her leaning back!

151
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,090
Do you know what's

152
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,420
gonna happen to you
after messing with the Navy?!

153
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,390
I can do whatever I want!

154
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,760
Because I'm beautiful!

155
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,440
This is great. She helped me out again.

156
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,160
Wait for me, Ace!

157
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,120
What did you say?! Kuma is dead?!

158
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,580
Then, who is this right here?!

159
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,870
He's alive! Stop talking nonsense!

160
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,800
Ivan-chan! Ah?!

161
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,800
That's the bear guy!

162
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,570
Be careful, Ivan-chan! If
you get blown away by him...

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,240
I'm okay. Now, Kuma, move out of my way!

164
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,580
Ivan-chan, do you know him?

165
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, sort of. But he's acting strange.

166
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,460
Seems like you both have memories of Kuma.

167
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,350
But the Kuma that you both knew
and this one are not the same!

168
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,350
N-Not the same? What is he talking about?

169
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,520
That can't be true!

170
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,360
I'm absolutely sure that he's
the Paw-Paw Fruit eater--Kuma!

171
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,020
Say something, Kuma!

172
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,990
He's pissing me off! Although
he has always been quiet.

173
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,450
I told you that it's no use talking to him.

174
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,750
It was just days ago...

175
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,260
The Government scientist--Dr. Vegapunk
modified him for the last time

176
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,050
and he turned into a complete
human weapon at last!

177
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,890
To be precise, he's the
former Bartholomew Kuma!

178
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,690
Modified? Weapon? What
are you talking about?!

179
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,820
In fact, he volunteered to be a guinea pig
for a study to build a human weapon...

180
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,570
...run by the Government.

181
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,070
First, his hands. Second, his legs.

182
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:17,960
While his mind worked, they
modified his body piece by piece.

183
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,460
Stop lying! Kuma hates the Government!

184
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,590
He wouldn't sacrifice his life for them.

185
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,840
I know that he wouldn't do that!

186
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,550
Stop yelling.

187
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,850
I don't know what kind of deal
he had with the Government.

188
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,190
Only a few days ago,

189
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,320
he still had his personality.

190
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,950
But now, he doesn't even remember

191
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,290
that he was born human so
he is no better than dead.

192
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,540
He is a monster who fights
as the Government tells him.

193
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,710
He is Pacifista PX-0!

194
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,670
So you better forget about the past!

195
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,550
Kuma! What's happened to you
over these past several years?!

196
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,530
Now I remember him saying...

197
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,240
We will never meet again.

198
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,530
Farewell...

199
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,450
...At that time.

200
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,750
What's wrong, Kuma?! It's me! Ivankov!

201
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,670
Wh-Where'd he go?!

202
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,800
Watch out, you guys! Heads up!

203
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,390
Pad Cannon.

204
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,070
Kuma, you bastard!

205
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,530
Face...

206
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,280
...Spectrum!

207
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,930
I'm watching you!

208
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,460
Galaxy Wink!

209
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,130
Heehaw!

210
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,350
How could you attack  my sweet candy boys?!

211
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,560
I'm not gonna go easy on you anymore!

212
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,190
Here!

213
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,520
Kick!

214
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,990
That's how strong he is!

215
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,660
Among all people that I've met...

216
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,120
My face!

217
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,580
My face!

218
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,040
My face!

219
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,790
No one has ever forgotten
my face in my entire life!

220
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,550
Oh, uh, hmmm.

221
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,880
But...

222
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,550
...even if you've lost your memory,

223
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,220
if you can't remember how scary I am,

224
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,850
I'm gonna beat it into your body!

225
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,060
Be ready for it!

226
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,770
He's recovered, so quick!

227
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,860
I'll take it from here!

228
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,070
You guys, go ahead and back Straw boy up!

229
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,910
Roger!

230
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Okay, let's go, Straw Hat!

231
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,910
Thanks, Ivan-chan!

232
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,170
Get to the scaffold!

233
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,220
They suddenly disappeared in ice!

234
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,220
It doesn't seem like Admiral
Aokiji used Ice Age again...

235
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,770
Where did they...?

236
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,060
This ice is not cold!

237
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,240
What's wrong?

238
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,900
Alright, guys.

239
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,360
Listen carefully.

240
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,110
Blah-blah-blah... Buggy is great.

241
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,700
Dah-dah-dah... Buggy is genius.

242
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,490
Right? That's how we want it.

243
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,870
That's nice!

244
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,770
And we want the world to be shaken
by the arrival of the new hero.

245
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,590
That's a perfect plan!

246
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,960
Y-You sure?

247
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,800
Let's go, guys!

248
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,520
How annoying, Straw Hat!

249
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,770
Don't fall behind! The plan is called
"Take Captain Buggy to Fame!"

250
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,560
Now is the time to proceed it!

251
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,860
When we succeed, the whole
world will be stunned!

252
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,450
All of you, do as we planned
and watch what you're doing!

253
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,580
Are you sure about that plan?

254
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,550
Crocodile!

255
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,960
There're too many!

256
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,180
I'm too far away from him.

257
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,810
I won't let you get near Pops!

258
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,020
Don't stand in my...

259
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,560
...way!

260
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,900
What a pain in the ass.
He's still messing around.

261
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,410
Brilliant Punk!

262
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,460
He's giant but so fast! How can I avoid him?

263
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,220
The 3rd division commander--Diamond Jozu!

264
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,570
How did you get out of the prison, gator guy?

265
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,360
Did you like the Pool of Blood?

266
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,510
Doflamingo, mind your own business.

267
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,330
Or I'm gonna kill you!

268
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,190
You have a dirty mouth. He-he.

269
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,290
Hey, why don't you team up with me?

270
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,150
Stop here!

271
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,710
Don't get in his way!

272
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,210
Keep going, Straw Hat!

273
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,180
Thanks!

274
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,810
Ace!

275
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm sorry, "Red-Haired."

276
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,870
I will not hold back my power.

277
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,090
That's...

278
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,590
..."Hawk-Eye!"

279
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,630
Now, I wonder if fate...

280
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,900
...will end the life of the child
of the next generation here.

281
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,650
Or, if it will save him
from this Black Sword!

282
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,730
Dracule Mihawk,

283
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,880
one of the Seven Warlords of
the Sea, stands before Luffy.

284
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,550
A single slash by the
world's strongest swordsman

285
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,640
easily splits a massive wall of ice in two.

286
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,600
How will Luffy fight back

287
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,730
against such immense strength?

288
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,520
"The Great Swordsman Mihawk!

290
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,930
Luffy Comes Under the Attack
of the Black Sword!"

291
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
