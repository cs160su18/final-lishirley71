00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,850
We won’t left anyone behind

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,140
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,400
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,070
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,130
On their way to the New World, Luffy and
his crew reached the Fish-Man Island,

74
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,590
where the New Fish-Man Pirates

75
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,590
who are looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom,
are engaging in secret maneuvers.

76
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,050
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

77
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,980
Friends or foes? That's something...

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,770
...you'll have to decide on your own!

79
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,860
"A Big Clash! The Straw Hats vs.
A Hundred Thousand Enemies!"

80
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:55,710
S-So he's the Straw Hat Luffy who
invaded the Navy HQ twice, 2 years ago!

81
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,500
A pirate ship is here, too!

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,880
So are all the Straw Hats!

83
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,330
Silly Straw Hat! I can't believe
he was hiding in the shark's mouth!

84
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,500
I thought that skeleton and the others
were captive in the Ryugu Palace.

85
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,050
--We've been waiting for you, Straw Hat!
--H-He really came!

86
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,550
Madam Sharley! The pirate
with a hat just showed up!

87
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,590
He saved the King and the Princes!

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,560
Straw Hat boy...

89
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,520
Did I do okay, Jimbei?

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,610
It wasn't so disastrous,
considering it was Luffy.

91
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,490
Mm-hm. Although it did not
go exactly as we had planned...

92
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,110
A FEW HOURS AGO--SEA FOREST

93
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,030
Outta my way!

94
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,530
No, I won't let you go!

95
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,450
Luffy-chin... Boss Jimbei...

96
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,040
Hey, that's enough already!

97
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,630
E-Excuse me, but they are
going to kill Father-sama!

98
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,630
I said "Outta my way"!
I'm gonna go kick those guys' asses!

99
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,930
How many times do I have to tell you?
I said "Wait"! Let me finish!

100
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,970
How would you describe our relationship?

101
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,140
We're friends!

102
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,520
That's right.

103
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,190
It's such a simple relationship but the
Fish-Men and humans couldn't establish it

104
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,650
and have been struggling to do so for years.

105
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,820
When I left you the message
"Don't fight against Hordy,"

106
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,360
I meant "Don't fight him recklessly."

107
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
Don't rush!

108
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,490
If you just go and beat Hordy up,

109
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:59,170
people on the island will think that you
are just another violent human bully.

110
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,170
Instead,

111
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,260
I want you to become the hero who
will save the Fish-Man Island!

112
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,840
Hero?

113
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
No!

114
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,680
What?!

115
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,060
We're pirates!

116
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,350
I love heroes but I don't wanna be one!

117
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,150
Do you know what heroes are?

118
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,530
Say there is a chunk of meat.

119
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,190
Pirates will have a banquet and eat it

120
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,200
but heroes will share it with other people.

121
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I want all the meat!

122
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,950
Is that how he defines a hero?

123
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,210
So it all comes back to meat again.

124
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,920
I will let you have your meat
just as long as you do as I tell you!

125
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,630
Okay.

126
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,710
What?! That easy?!

127
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,140
In the simplest terms, I will call for
your help so I want you to respond.

128
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,930
Help you?

129
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,930
Yes, first, Megalo and I will get caught
voluntarily and enter the plaza.

130
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,820
While they are paying attention to us,

131
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,860
one of you sneak out of
Megalo's stomach and...

132
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,740
Out of his stomach?

133
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,960
They will have the letter
from the Celestial Dragons.

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,790
What letter?

135
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,540
Oh yeah.

136
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,210
Luffy was sleeping so he
missed most of Jimbei's story.

137
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,180
It is...

138
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,100
...something Queen Otohime acquired
10 years ago, at the risk of her life

139
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,640
and it will define the future of this island!

140
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,940
And they will also have
the key to free the King.

141
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,060
We need to get our hands on those 2 things.

142
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,440
Who is up to it?

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,150
I'm good at stealing! I can do it with Robin.

144
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,320
Yeah.

145
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,330
All right. Once you free the King,
I will call for Luffy-kun's help.

146
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,670
And once Luffy-kun emerges gallantly,
out of Megalo's body,

147
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,130
people will notice that Luffy-kun
and I are working together.

148
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,640
Princess-sama, you wait somewhere
completely safe outside of the plaza.

149
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,560
And after we pass you the letter,
flee with the freed King and the Princes.

150
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,900
Meanwhile, the rest of you, get to the
Ryugu Place now and save your friends.

151
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,820
And then, hurry to the plaza with them.

152
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,530
Now--about how to rescue your
friends in the Ryugu Palace...

153
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,990
Figure it out yourself!

154
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,950
You don't care about us, do you?!

155
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,250
Okay! Super count on it!

156
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,460
We have the Sunny!

157
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,080
We'll figure it out!

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,630
Mm-hm.

159
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,920
Once this is all set into motion, how do
you think the citizens will respond?

160
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,180
Both the citizens of the Fish-Man Island

161
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,180
and the outlaws of the Fish-Man
District respect Jimbei-san.

162
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,360
Uh-huh. So if they find out that Boss trusts
Luffy-chin with his life, to save the King,

163
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,730
they'll root for you, Luffy-chin!

164
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,030
Straw Hat.

165
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,490
Luffy-sama.

166
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,240
I am only doing this because
you asked me to, Jimbei!

167
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,290
It's uncomfortable having
everybody cheer me on.

168
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,420
Yeah, we're not used to that treatment.

169
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,800
I'd fight the king of the devils himself
if the Mermaids-chan cheered for me!

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,170
Thank you!

171
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,090
That settles it.

172
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,010
Okay, let's do it!

173
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,810
Is there something else?

174
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,730
Should we pick a codename
for this operation?

175
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,650
Who cares!

176
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,610
Alright, let's hurry up!

177
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,950
So you saved your friends at the
Ryugu Palace successfully.

178
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,990
Straw!

179
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,490
Pappagu! I'm happy to see you again!

180
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,370
But, but, I've had quite a few brushes
with death because of them!

181
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,130
Straw Hat Luffy is a human and a pirate

182
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:15,840
THE OUTSKIRTS OF CONCHCORDE PLAZA

183
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,670
but he's on our side, right?

184
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,180
Princess Shirahoshi called for his help!

185
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,720
It looks like he came to save
this country with Boss Jimbei!

186
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,430
Straw Hat!

187
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,230
They love you so much.

188
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,440
But you only saved the King
temporarily so don't push your luck!

189
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,530
You're just a human pirate!

190
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,030
Mermaid Princess-san, you're so beautiful!

191
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,990
Excuse me, could I look at your panties?

192
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,120
Don't ask the Princess that!

193
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,790
Then, show me yours.

194
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,330
Why should I?!

195
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,210
We're all together again finally!

196
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,630
They're ignoring you!

197
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,470
Well, that's because I
said it in a small voice!

198
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,020
Nami-san! I rescued those idiots!

199
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,980
--Do you love me now?
--Yeah, yeah.

200
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,270
You fool! We got to the exit on our own.

201
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,060
Uh-huh.

202
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,240
And you couldn't have
done it without my help!

203
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,990
Pappagu helped them?!

204
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,490
No, before that, Brook became a ghost and...

205
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,870
Ghost?

206
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,160
That's right.

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,790
My newfound ability helped us!

208
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,590
I don't have much time!
I need the key... I mean, the sword!

209
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,420
I don't have time...

210
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,180
Stay away, Ghost!

211
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,390
Pappagu-san!

212
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,520
Huh?

213
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,190
How did the ghost know my name?

214
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,440
It's me!

215
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,910
I don't have any ghost friends!

216
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,120
You're the Bone, aren't you?

217
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,670
The water is here finally!

218
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,260
What are you doing, Brook?! It's too late!

219
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,850
Sorry to keep you waiting.

220
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,270
Oh, welcome back.

221
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,650
Here, your sword!

222
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,280
Good job, Zoro-san!

223
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,870
Alright, Zoro, let's get out of here!

224
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,080
--Three-Sword Style!
--What?!

225
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,010
You cut too much!

226
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,180
Oh yeah?

227
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,650
I can't swim anymore!

228
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,610
I-I need to breathe!

229
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,480
Damn!

230
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,980
I-I'm gonna die!

231
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,780
Zoro! Usopp! Brook!

232
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,240
Super we're here to pick you up!

233
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,790
We made it.

234
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,290
That's how it went.

235
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,960
Brook's new ability sounds awesome! Anyway...

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,090
Those guys got their
captain beaten by Luffy.

237
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,680
How come they don't seem worried?

238
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,970
You're right. That's odd.

239
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,030
Here you go.

240
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,790
It's the letter from the Celestial Dragons.

241
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,420
Thank you all!

242
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,130
This is the hope of the Fish-Man Island,
that Mother-sama left behind.

243
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,300
But I think it's not safe for Yowahoshi.

244
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Mm-hm, her capture was
not a part of our plan.

245
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,850
Neither was asking her to escape on her own.

246
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,600
Luffy-sama, what did you just call me?

247
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,900
You were calling me
"Coward (Yowamushi)" before.

248
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,820
Yeah, it's not like I know everything but
you're not as timid as I thought you were.

249
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,370
So I'll call you Yowahoshi from now on!

250
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,960
It's understandable why someone would
hate those who they think wronged them.

251
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,460
That man who insulted you...

252
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,460
That's exactly what he's doing.

253
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,300
But a coward couldn't have been so strong

254
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,470
and borne such hardship
on her own for this long.

255
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,310
She is right.

256
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,390
Princess Shirahoshi, it must have
been hard for you through the years.

257
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,390
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,980
I caused you trouble
because I kept it secret.

259
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,780
It's okay. I like you
just the way you are now.

260
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,530
No passing on hatred to the next generation.

261
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,490
That's what those brave
heroes were trying to teach us.

262
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,540
Don't tell the people
on the island anything!

263
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,050
Don't let resentment or hatred
get the better of you for my sake.

264
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,180
There is a small "sprout"
that bloomed in your heart.

265
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,220
If all people on the island share it
and think the same way as you do one day,

266
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,140
there will be no more
fighting and the conflict

267
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,770
between Fish-Men
and humans will be over.

268
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,820
I don't think the years you
suffered through were meaningless.

269
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,240
You must have been trying
so hard to protect...

270
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,740
...that small "sprout"
single-handedly, day after day.

271
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,660
But let us protect it for you this time.

272
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,100
Y-Yes!

273
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,150
Thank you very much!

274
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,910
She may not be a coward
but she sure is a crybaby!

275
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,370
Straw Hat! Kick the crap out of them!

276
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,250
Vander Decken was so useless!

277
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,090
I needed him to get rid of Shirahoshi.

278
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,460
Captain Hordy!

279
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,470
The Energy Steroid is
still working as I thought.

280
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,060
No wonder. He took a lot of them.

281
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,180
Captain's back!

282
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,030
She's the legendary Mermaid
Princess with that troublesome power.

283
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,490
So I needed to take out Shirahoshi
as soon as possible, but...

284
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,170
...you people duped me completely.

285
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,880
Jimbei.

286
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,170
I should have noticed when you
gave in without resistance.

287
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,510
You're quite taken with
these humans, aren't you?!

288
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,930
I despise your kind the most!

289
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,980
Fisher Tiger who you grew up together
with in the Fish-Man District

290
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,230
and Arlong who was like a brother to you,
were both beaten or killed by humans!

291
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,900
But instead of seeking revenge for them,
you joined hands with humans!

292
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,410
You are as gutless as Neptune!

293
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,660
When I become king of the island,
I'll change everything!

294
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,710
This year's World Summit
is a perfect opportunity!

295
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,670
I'm gonna kill the human kings from
all over the world at Marie Jois

296
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,430
and the legend of a terrifying
underwater kingdom will begin!

297
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,020
We'll drag all humans in the world
into the water and enslave them!

298
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,650
Eventually, no one will be able
to stand against Fish-Men.

299
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,440
Even in the world of pirates!

300
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,950
All pirates will fall down on their knees
before us--the New Fish-Man Pirates!

301
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,080
Look at these human pirates with
confidence in their ability to fight!

302
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,960
You will all be like them, Straw Hat!

303
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,840
I'll be the one who becomes
King of the Pirates!

304
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,050
The King of the Pirates?

305
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,100
You're just a band of 10 half-assed
pirates. You can't do anything!

306
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,400
We have 100,000 on our side!

307
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,320
Th-There are so many of them.

308
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,530
Straw Hat and Boss Jimbei have only
10 people. Are they gonna be okay?

309
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,240
If they lose, Hordy will take
over the Fish-Man Island!

310
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,790
And we will be kicked out of our home!

311
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,920
Beat them up! Straw Hat! Boss Jimbei!

312
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,340
Straw Hat!

313
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Kill them all, New Fish-Man Pirates!

314
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,100
Here come 100,000 enemies!
How can we fight them?!

315
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,560
It's impossible!

316
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,190
This is why I don't wanna
get involved with you guys!

317
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,520
Before we fight, we could get squashed.

318
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,440
Squash?! No!

319
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,660
100,000 enemies?! I'm so
stunned - my eyes will pop out!

320
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,330
But I don't have eyes to pop out!

321
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,460
100,000 is nothing! Let's do this!

322
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,790
Don't hide behind us while you say that!

323
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,630
Here I go! My time has come!

324
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,090
Super Armored Me!

325
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,930
All right! Bring it on!

326
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,970
There are 10 of us.

327
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,850
So we each have to beat 10,000 of them.

328
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,360
They outnumber us but it
doesn't mean they're stronger.

329
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,820
It's not like they're elite Navy soldiers.
So don't shit yourself.

330
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,240
What did you say, you stupid Moss Head?!

331
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,370
Bring it on, you Bloody-nosed, Two-bit Chef!

332
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,950
Hey, Luffy!

333
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,750
L-Luffy-kun!

334
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,790
Luffy-sama?

335
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,590
That 400 million berry prize is mine!

336
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,010
No, mine!

337
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,760
No way!

338
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,590
Kill him!

339
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,960
What's going on here?!

340
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,820
He didn't do anything but
so many of us got knocked out!

341
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,200
Hey, stand up, guys!

342
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,530
Damn! He beat half of us in a single moment!

343
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,700
That means 50,000 people
in an instant? What did he do?!

344
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,540
What's going on?

345
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,170
Wh-What? What just happened?

346
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,830
He's so strong. That Straw Hat boy...

347
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,960
The Straw Hat pirate did it?!

348
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,800
Cool, Straw Hat!

349
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,590
That was Haki!

350
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,390
He's gotten much stronger in just 2 years.

351
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,430
That was Conqueror's Haki?
So he was capable of that, as I thought.

352
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,640
That's what I needed from my captain.
Otherwise, he needs to step down.

353
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,110
That was amazing! Luffy-sama!

354
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,360
You're Hordy, right?
I guess I have to kick your ass.

355
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,240
You can become king of whatever
you want in any country.

356
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,950
But there can only be
one King of the Pirates!

357
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,300
The Straw Hats have begun their all-out
battle against the New Fish-Man Pirates.

358
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,800
Surrounded by Hordy's superior numbers,

359
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,050
they must protect Shirahoshi
from the relentless assault.

360
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,430
And the new attacks developed over two years

361
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,730
by Zoro and Sanji will erupt!

362
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

363
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,440
"Deadly Attacks One After Another!
Zoro and Sanji Join the Battle!"

364
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
