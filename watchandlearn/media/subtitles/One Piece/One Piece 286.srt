00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,970
My treasure?

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,820
If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,960
Find it!

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,380
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,680
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,650
and set out in search
of something to find

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,440
ONE PIECE!

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,370
Compasses only cause delays

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,860
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,760
If the dusty treasure map

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,810
has been verified,

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,200
it's not a legend!

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,260
When it comes to personal storms,

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn't there!

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,540
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,490
We are, We are on the cruise!

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,800
We are!

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,020
Wealth, fame, power...

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,750
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,130
My treasure?

34
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,380
If you want it, you can have it!

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,740
Find it!

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,830
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,690
Let me go!

40
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,720
Is Lucci that pigeon guy?

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah, that's right.

42
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,600
If he's with Robin-chan,

43
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,390
we should
let at least Luffy go on ahead.

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,280
Luffy.

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,920
At any rate, you just
beat up the pigeon guy.

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,860
Let me go! Let me go!

47
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,940
There are six of us excluding Luffy.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,540
He said there are five CP9 members here.

49
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,840
We'll get the five keys for Robin-chan's
handcuffs from them and go after Luffy.

50
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,420
If Robin-kun goes through
the gates, it'll all be over.

51
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,380
It's all a race against time!

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,760
If we lose against them,
that means we lose time!

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
Everyone! Take them down
even if it costs you your life!

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,690
Yeah!

55
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,560
Good luck!

56
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,370
Help won't come, Nico Robin.

57
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,620
They don't know how to get to the
Gates of Justice in the first place!

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,950
Come out! You pigeon jerk!

59
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,960
Chapapapapa...

60
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm Silent Fukurou! I like rumors!

61
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,820
Do you want the key?

62
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,860
Dammit!

63
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,510
I still haven't refilled my cola yet!

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,430
Chapa...!

65
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,160
Yoyoi!

66
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,000
You damn pirate!

67
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,580
You're doomed now that
I've caught you here!

68
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,320
They must've gotten scared of me...

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,530
Ahhh...!

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Someone's here!

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,460
What about this room?!

72
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,290
Dammit...

73
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,980
No one's here, either.

74
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,520
Please make yourself at home.

75
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,220
"Devil Fruit Powers!
Kaku and Jabra Transform"

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,450
Yooo!

77
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,580
Yoyoi...! Yoyoi!

78
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,090
Now... are you...

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
...prepared?!

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,130
Prepared?!

81
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,370
No matter how I look at it,
I'm at a disadvantage.

82
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,810
Obtaining the key is my
priority here! Okay, then!

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,690
Hey, assassin! Where's the key?!

84
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,280
If you don't know...

85
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,070
...I'll tell you where!

86
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,530
The key is...

87
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,910
Yep, yep. The key is...?

88
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,870
The key is...

89
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,120
Yes, yes. And...?

90
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,590
The key is...

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,130
I'm listening!

92
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,050
...right here!

93
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,900
Oh...?!

94
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,770
Where did my key go?!

95
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,180
He's loud, and a pain to boot.

96
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,480
That's no good.

97
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,400
What?

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,780
Mademoiselle.

99
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,150
That water is too lukewarm
to make good tea.

100
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,610
Here are the golden rules
for making black tea.

101
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,570
First, boil fresh water

102
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,250
and pour it into a teapot
that was warmed beforehand.

103
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,070
When coin-size bubbles start appearing,
that's when you should stop heating it.

104
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,250
By doing so,

105
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,170
the leaves move around
due to the circulation of hot water,

106
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,140
which brings out their scent and color.

107
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,980
Then, cover the teapot
immediately and steam it well.

108
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,350
Once it's done,
pour it into warmed teacups.

109
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,730
Just a little bit of consideration
makes a difference in the taste.

110
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,400
You sure do know your stuff.

111
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm a cook, so...

112
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,990
Thanks for the lesson.

113
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,950
You're so beautiful!

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,610
This is probably the place.

115
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,970
I finally made it.

116
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,890
I had to go
up and down all those stairs.

117
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,940
Robin!

118
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,430
Hey! Robin!

119
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,120
It's me!

120
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,620
Robin!

121
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,530
Where are you?!

122
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,690
Dammit!

123
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,070
So they really did leave already.

124
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,710
That damn pigeon guy!

125
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,550
Oh, yeah...!

126
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,330
I know where they're headed.

127
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,910
So I just have to head to the
Gates of Justice, too, right?!

128
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,760
You have the key
to Robin's handcuffs, right?

129
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,090
Want to give it to me
before I take you down?

130
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,250
That's a foolish question.

131
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,120
I was disappointed that I didn't
get to see your real ability

132
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,110
at the Galley-La mansion.

133
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,440
I never thought that pirates
would come this far, either, so...

134
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,150
Be careful, as I'm far
stronger than that time.

135
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,160
I can imagine,
with all that energy you've got...

136
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,620
Energy like that of a beast.

137
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,470
What a fearsome man you are.

138
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,620
But

139
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,540
my swordsmanship is the best in CP9.

140
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,170
Don't underestimate me.

141
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,500
Two-Sword Style, huh?

142
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,800
Tempest Kick.

143
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,320
So, no... Sorry, but I use four swords.

144
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,890
No problem.

145
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,650
Come to think of it,
your entire body is a weapon.

146
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,270
Seventy-two...

147
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,030
Tempest Kick.

148
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,100
--...Pound Phoenix!
--White Thunder!

149
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,280
Shave!

150
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,900
This is fun!

151
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,390
I don't have time to have fun!

152
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,560
Then you just have to take me down.

153
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,110
Tempest Kick.

154
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,070
Slaughter!

155
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,420
To think that he uses
slashing attacks so freely...

156
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,640
You bastard... Are you mocking me?

157
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,600
Whoa... I'd expect no less from you.

158
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,390
If you're in that much
of a hurry, I'll show you...

159
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,330
...my new powers.

160
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,890
Wh... What the hell?!

161
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,050
At any rate, what the heck is this room?

162
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,240
No matter how you look at it,
someone went nuts on the gardening.

163
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,220
This is practically outside!

164
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,740
No, no...

165
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,240
More importantly, I have to get
the key to Robin's handcuffs right now!

166
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,590
That key...!

167
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,470
Tiptoe...

168
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,190
Tiptoe...

169
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,890
No need to hesitate!

170
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,070
Carefully, tiptoe...

171
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,400
Move step by step
without making noise...

172
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,690
"Wolf"

173
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,930
That was close!

174
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,390
Okay, I'll try again!

175
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,070
If I quietly grab it,

176
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,080
then quietly run away...

177
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,270
I'll accomplish my mission.

178
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,430
It'll be a victory without wounds!

179
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,580
That's right.

180
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,580
I'm a lucky king!

181
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,450
Hey, heart!

182
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,850
You're beating too loud!

183
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,010
Stop!

184
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,990
Ahh! My heart stopped!

185
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,800
H-Hey! What're you doing?!
Start beating!

186
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,280
You can't stop!

187
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,920
Oh, yeah, at a time like this,
I have to perform a heart massage!

188
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,380
Boy, that scared me.

189
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,730
Calm down. Calm down.

190
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,250
Do your best!

191
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm a man who makes
everything he does work out...

192
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,860
...probably...

193
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,380
I can do it...

194
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,640
I can do it...

195
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,890
I can do...

196
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,700
Wh-What?! A bee?!

197
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,720
Stay away! Go away! Huh?

198
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,120
What're you doing?!

199
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,540
The tip of my nose
isn't a flower!

200
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,430
There's no honey there!

201
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,130
Go somewhere else!

202
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,020
I'm saying go somewhere else!

203
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,830
Wh-Why are you looking at me?
What's with that sparkle in your eyes?!

204
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,050
D-Don't tell me... you're going to...
Don't do it! Don't!

205
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,590
Don't! Don't!

206
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,510
My nose! My nose!

207
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,280
It hurts!

208
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,380
Dammit!

209
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,090
I came back to where I was earlier.

210
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,580
At any rate, to think that he
still hasn't woken up yet...

211
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,900
He's quite a sleepyhead.

212
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,140
If I take the time to do it properly,
it'll be fine this time for sure!

213
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,880
Tiptoe...

214
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,160
Tiptoe...

215
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,030
Tiptoe, tiptoe...

216
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,440
Tiptoe...

217
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,960
Tiptoe...

218
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,210
I'm almost there...

219
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm almost there...

220
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,930
I'm almost there...!

221
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,070
A-A chicken this time?!

222
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,790
Oh, no! What is the noisiest
bird of them all doing here?

223
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,830
Oh, no!

224
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,220
If it crows, it's all over!

225
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,990
If it crows, he'll get up,
find me, and kill me!

226
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,980
Hey

227
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,310
What're you looking at?!

228
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,450
Are you trying to crow?

229
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,180
Are you?! Are you?!

230
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,460
Shhh! Shhh!

231
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,130
Chicken-kun! Chicken-san!
Chicken-sama! Please!

232
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,750
Please don't crow!

233
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,160
Don't crow!
Don't! Don't!

234
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,300
No chicken would crow like that!

235
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,520
Oh, you're here, pirate.

236
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,480
Th-That damn chicken!

237
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,940
Well then, why don't
I give you a beatdown?

238
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,830
That damn chicken!

239
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,250
H-He's strong...

240
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,250
So you're the one who came?!

241
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,940
You're the one who shot through
the Government flag, right?

242
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,810
"Liquor"

243
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,170
It seems that you're skilled at sniping.

244
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,230
He delivered a punch like that
right after he woke up?

245
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,170
Sorry for attacking you half-assed.

246
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,070
Forgive me.

247
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,490
It must've hurt.

248
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,710
"Liquor"

249
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,960
Huh?

250
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,820
Don't worry.

251
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,380
I may not look like it,
but I'm not into tormenting my opponent.

252
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,090
A-A devil fruit...!

253
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,050
The Dog-Dog Fruit, Model Wolf!

254
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll just tear up your windpipe
and that'll be it.

255
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,880
You'll die anyway.

256
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,240
You don't have to suffer.

257
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,020
Isn't that right?

258
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,860
W-Wolf...!

259
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,730
D-Dammit!

260
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,670
What?! Are you gonna fight?

261
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,490
You don't look strong, though.

262
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,540
S-Strong or not, I'm gonna fight!

263
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,290
Shut up!

264
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,660
I came to rescue Robin!

265
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,340
Whoa! The ceiling is...

266
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,630
...collapsing!

267
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,110
Oh, shoot!

268
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,720
I was gonna
stop the transformation

269
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,680
when I reached my human-beast form,
but I became a giraffe!

270
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,140
A talking giraffe is falling towards us!

271
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,780
Kaku!

272
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,650
That power of yours is too cool!

273
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,990
A wolf?!

274
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,480
What is this place?! A zoo?!

275
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,370
The Ox-Ox Fruit, Model Giraffe!

276
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,810
You poor guy!

277
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,120
To think that you'll be
a giraffe-man for the rest of your life!

278
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,220
What's wrong with giraffes?!

279
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,050
I said I like it!

280
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,970
That pigeon guy
was a leopard, wasn't he?

281
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,430
To think that there are two more power
holders who transform into animals...

282
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,140
Is CP9 that kind of group?

283
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,680
S-So he is a Zoan-type power holder...

284
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,850
A wolf-man and a giraffe-man?

285
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,490
What crazy guys we're facing!

286
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,120
But it was good that Zoro
fell with that giraffe.

287
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,360
While it appears to be a
two-versus-two fight, I'll just wait for Zoro...

288
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,580
...to pretty much take them both down.

289
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,490
"I said I like it"?!

290
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,540
I'm sure you do!

291
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,660
Giraffes are cool, aren't they?!

292
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,220
Wh-What're you talking that way for?!

293
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,950
At any rate, for comrades,
they sure don't work together.

294
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,550
What's that?

295
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,140
It looks like a safe
with the door left opened.

296
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,140
Whoa!

297
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,600
Could those
weird-looking handcuffs be...?!

298
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,270
I said don't laugh!

299
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,450
Hey, giraffe!

300
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,110
Just how long are you gonna
stand there arguing with him?

301
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,990
I thought I told you
that I don't have much time.

302
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,620
If it's okay for you to stay like that,
I'll just cut you down like that.

303
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,540
How foolish... Don't underestimate a
giraffe's limitless destructive power!

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,450
Transform...

305
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,960
Human-beast form!

306
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,180
I'll show you

307
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,900
the power I gained when I was reborn!

308
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,370
How lame!

309
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,360
Gasp!

310
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
What'd you just...?

311
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,460
What a shallow thing I said!

312
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,410
That was bad!

313
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,050
I was so shocked
that it just came out of my mouth!

314
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,500
Don't lose your composure, Zoro!
Or your techniques will weaken!

315
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,130
Just how long are you gonna
continue to laugh, Jabra?!

316
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,190
S-Sorry.

317
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,180
I can't stop after all!

318
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,410
At any rate, it's interesting.

319
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,110
How in the heck did his square
parts get reflected like this?!

320
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,640
Wh-What're these handcuffs?!

321
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,160
Ahhh!

322
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,560
Shoot! I'm sorry, Zoro-kun!

323
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,500
Hey! What're you doing?!

324
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,570
Th-They're probably Sea Prism
Stone handcuffs just like Robin's!

325
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,430
Since our enemies are both
Devil Fruit power holders,

326
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,090
I thought they'd get weak if
they were handcuffed with them!

327
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,550
So why are they on me, you idiot?!

328
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,460
B-Because...

329
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,980
...the giraffe's face is so
funny that I just lost my grip.

330
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,560
A giraffe with square parts everywhere...

331
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,790
He's right!

332
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,950
How dare you all...?

333
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,530
Experience the fighting
power of a power holder...!

334
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,450
Tempest Kick!

335
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,200
Whoa! What's that?!

336
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,630
He's gonna do something!

337
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,760
Sky Slicer!

338
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,760
This isn't good.

339
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,640
Duck, Usopp!

340
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,920
No! This is no time for having tea!

341
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,430
Oh, that's too bad.
Are you in a hurry?

342
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,610
Robin-chan's life is at stake.

343
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,720
If you're gonna be in my way,

344
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,660
I won't
go easy on you, even if you are a woman!

345
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,350
Then I guess teatime is over?

346
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

347
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,320
"I Won't Kick Even If It Costs
Me My Life! Sanji's Chivalry!"

348
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,210
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
