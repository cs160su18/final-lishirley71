2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,970
I won't go easy on anyone
who tries to harm the lady!

48
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,770
What's going on here?

49
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,370
Isn't that dog-penguin hybrid our enemy?

50
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,440
The fighting style he just used...

51
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,490
He couldn't be...

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,820
Bastard!

53
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,120
Rookie, you're stepping way out of line!

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
That woman is the enemy!

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,240
What is wrong with you?!

56
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,630
I will beat table manners into anyone
uncouth enough to harm a lady...

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,960
...you damn zombies!

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,380
I'm sure of it! That dog-penguin is...

59
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,140
Dang, they're persistent!

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,600
Gum-Gum...

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,050
...Gatling!

62
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,610
One-Sword Style...

63
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,990
...Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,750
That move... Zoro?!

65
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,460
Hey, Zoro! What was that for?!

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,410
That was dangerous!

67
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,850
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame!

68
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,570
That hurt, you bastard! Lemme out, dammit!

69
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,740
--What was that?
--Bastard, lemme out! I mean it!

70
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,950
I'll let you have it if ya don't
let me out! Open the lid!

71
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,200
--A casket?!
--Lemme out, bastard! I want out!

72
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,620
Open the lid right this second!
Lemme out right now! C'mon!

73
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,500
That voice...!

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,420
What's he doing?! Sheesh!

75
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,500
Did that idiot get caught?

76
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,220
Straw Hat!

77
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,210
I won't let you go after him!

78
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey, hey! Monkey, monkey, monkey!

79
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm the spider monkey that you were
talking about back at the harbor!

80
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,850
It's a giant spider!

81
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,070
This ain't an arachnid
anymore! It's a monster!

82
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,700
Lemme out, you jerk! Lemme out, dummy!

83
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,780
Open the--

84
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,410
And there goes another one!

85
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,380
Shit! There goes the casket!

86
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,850
What are you gonna do to him?!

87
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,380
Don't you worry!

88
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,590
You'll get to personally experience
what is about to happen to him.

89
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,510
I'd be more worried about
myself if I were you!

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,010
You're trapped with me in front
and the armored warriors in the rear!

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,560
With this, your crew is finished!

92
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,970
"Chivalry Remains! The Traitorous
Zombie Protects Nami!"

93
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,090
Hey! What's gotten into you, rookie?

94
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,970
I thought it was impossible for a
zombie to defy the master's orders!

95
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,510
Why is he able to pull it off?

96
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,600
He's as strong as a General to boot!

97
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,760
You cannot use logic to measure this power.

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,480
It is the power to make the
impossible become possible!

99
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,570
The hurricane that blasts
everything in its path is known as...

100
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,200
...love.

101
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,330
Sure enough, that "dog penguin"
is spouting out a bunch of nonsense.

102
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,670
He sounds just like Sanji-kun.

103
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,790
You're right!

104
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,920
Hey, Dogguin! Do you know Sanji?

105
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,760
See, we're Sanji's best
buds! Could ya lend us--

106
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,480
Shut the heck up, you stinking pirates!

107
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,640
"Evil Be Gone"

108
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,760
Scary!

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,560
So he really is our enemy after all!

110
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,580
Wh-What's that?

111
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,090
Something is headed this way.

112
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,900
What now?!

113
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,320
Wait, Lola!

114
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,320
Huh? A boar?

115
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,370
Wait, dammit! Lola!

116
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,460
Catch me if you can!

117
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,870
Don't be stupid! You're going to stop!

118
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,130
Nothing in the world could make me stop!

119
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,500
That's what I'll make you think, and then...

120
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,470
What?!

121
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,060
Bride Fu! Princess Carry Vow!

122
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,430
What the heck?!

123
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,730
Wh-What was that?

124
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,860
Ab-sama! Accept my burning love!

125
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,120
H-Hey! Wait, Lola! Knock that off!

126
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,930
--How many times must I
spell it out for you?

127
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,580
I'm marrying that woman!

128
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,680
What was that? I couldn't hear you!

129
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,630
I love you!

130
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,380
Liar! There is no way you couldn't
hear me when we're this close!

131
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,090
Really, you can be so shy!

132
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,930
Listen to me!

133
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,620
Give up already!

134
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,850
I love you! I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!...

135
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,930
You'll never get me!

136
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,770
--I won't let that hit me!
--Uh, are they fighting...?

137
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,790
Beats me...

138
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,610
--You're being pigheaded.
--Stuff it!

139
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,950
Then marry me.

140
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,450
That makes no sense!

141
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,680
Snatch a Kiss with Love!

142
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,750
It's high time you gave it a rest!

143
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,580
Oh, my!

144
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,880
What?!

145
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,470
I found you, wretched Cat Burglar!

146
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,420
Nami!

147
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,430
Crap!

148
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,460
Who?! Me?!

149
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,900
W-W-Wait just one second!
I haven't stolen anything yet.

150
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,020
Save it!

151
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,490
I won't let you take Ab-sama!

152
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,910
--Nami!
--Look out!

153
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,960
Don't lay a hand on this lady!

154
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,760
How dare you get in my way?!

155
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,670
--Look out!
--Dogguin!

156
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,520
Dogguin!

157
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,480
Are you okay?

158
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
"Evil Be Gone"

159
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,440
Why didn't you attack her?

160
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,900
I won't kick a woman...

161
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,140
...even if it kills me!

162
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,610
Impressive!

163
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,910
You're willing to consider this beast
a woman? You're brilliant, man!

164
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,090
Excuse me?!

165
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,850
No! Usopp! Chopper!

166
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,710
I'll be taking my bride.

167
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,670
Eh?! Nami's flying? That's awesome!

168
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,920
No, you morons! I'm being kidnapped!

169
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,430
What? By whom?

170
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,390
H-Hey, wait!

171
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,560
Now then, we'll hold the
wedding ceremony right away.

172
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,390
I've already dealt with the preparations.

173
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,730
Put me down! It was you, wasn't it?

174
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,350
You're the invisible man
who was in the bathroom!

175
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,020
So there really was an invisible man?

176
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,060
Nami!

177
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,570
I knew it! It was you back there!

178
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,580
I had to appraise your wares.

179
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,370
You are worthy to become my bride!

180
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,750
My name is Absalom.

181
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,590
It is the name of your future husband.

182
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,950
You'd best remember it!

183
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,680
Don't try to sound so macho
after you looked me up and down!

184
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:52,520
I haven't been babying my skin
every day for a perverted beast!

185
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,270
Thunder Charge!

186
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,530
Nami!

187
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,380
Thank goodness! Now start running!

188
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,290
We're getting out of this forest.

189
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,090
What gives? He isn't blacking out!

190
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,630
Going by the looks of it,
he clearly isn't a small fry!

191
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,260
Hurry!

192
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,390
Wh-What could the shock
coursing through my body mean?

193
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,690
It feels as though I was
suddenly struck by lightning...

194
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,740
Could this be...

195
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,160
...love?!

196
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,580
I won't let you escape!

197
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,500
H-Hey, this is no time to be spacing out!

198
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,330
Our job was to catch those three!

199
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,170
That's right! If we fumble this,
Perona-sama will punish us!

200
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,550
Right, she sure will!

201
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,020
We shouldn't be standing here!

202
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,040
Crap! That lady is in trouble!

203
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,480
But why do I want to protect her anyway?

204
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,360
And my body won't move...!

205
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,030
This body is too weak!

206
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,940
Hurry and catch all three of them!

207
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,700
Wait, Wild Zombies!

208
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,870
Don't touch that woman!

209
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,870
Shut up, Erosalom!

210
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,580
The master ordered us to serve
as Perona-sama's subordinates!

211
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,740
We don't fall under your jurisdiction!

212
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,500
--Beat it!
--Yeah, you heard him!

213
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,550
Shut up! Keep your nose outta this.

214
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,890
I told you to wait!

215
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,640
I am fully aware that you
fall under Perona's domain.

216
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,530
However, you should also know
better than to incur my wrath!

217
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,990
I will only take so many snide remarks!

218
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,370
Do you understand?!

219
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,680
Who are you?

220
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,590
I won't let you go after that lady.

221
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,240
What was that?

222
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
H-Hey, rookie! Bite your tongue.

223
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,010
Don't make Absalom angry!

224
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,220
C-Crap!

225
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,510
H-Here it comes!

226
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,460
I warned you not to make me angry!

227
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,750
Wait, Cat Burglar!

228
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,790
Hey, Nami! Doesn't it seem
like everyone's after you?

229
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,590
Seriously! What's up with that?

230
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,750
Sheesh!

231
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,130
So, like, I've got an idea.

232
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,680
Wh-Why don't we split up?

233
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,230
I'm not a decoy, you heartless brute!

234
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,850
No!

235
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,690
Wait up, dammit!

236
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,480
Boars are scary!

237
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,440
Like anyone is gonna wait for you!

238
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,750
N-Nami?!

239
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,660
Wait! Don't abandon me!

240
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,280
Wait!

241
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,530
Here she comes!

242
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,090
No!

243
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,200
Wha--?!

244
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,170
Gah! I'm finished!

245
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,570
It's game over. Farewell, everyone.

246
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,170
Please scatter my ashes in the East Blue...

247
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,350
I won't forgive you!

248
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,230
Huh? What just happened?

249
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,270
We survived?

250
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,790
She doesn't care about
anyone other than Nami?

251
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,310
Phew! That's a load off...

252
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,410
Shoot! Nami!

253
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,550
We've gotta stop her, Chopper!

254
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,970
--Yeah!
--Hi-yo!

255
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,970
Give Absalom back!

256
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
What is your problem?!

257
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,230
Nami!

258
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,860
Man, you're one nasty...!

259
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,360
Get away from her!

260
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,950
Run for it, Nami!

261
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,950
Wait, fiend!

262
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,290
Damn it! Stop!

263
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,940
By any chance, did they also...

264
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,070
Lemme out, bastard! I want out, dammit!

265
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,570
Lemme out!

266
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,070
...get sucked into that wall like
what just happened to Straw Hat?

267
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,640
Monkey, monkey!

268
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,250
Yep! You guessed right.

269
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,790
And you will share their
fate in just a moment.

270
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,670
Immortal zombies are blocking the
paths in front of you and behind you.

271
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,630
Now say your prayers!

272
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,840
I'm not sure if you're a stupid
spider or a stupid monkey,

273
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,350
but aren't you responsible
for the massive web

274
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,350
that got all over Sunny at
the entrance to the island?

275
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,310
You’ve been keeping tabs on us;
you were out to get us from the beginning.

276
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,450
Yep! Don't underestimate the
power of our information network!

277
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:09,250
We knew exactly what you were up to
thanks to Perona-sama's Ghost Network!

278
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,920
Do your large ears also play a
part in collecting information?

279
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,880
They look like they have exceptional hearing.

280
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,640
Eh? What was that? What did you just say?

281
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,300
They're for show!

282
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,890
Franky...

283
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,330
Yeah, I know.

284
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,770
This situation bites. This is what
it means to be "up against a wall."

285
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,820
This calls for quick thinking...

286
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,740
Want me to handle it?

287
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,530
Be my guest.

288
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,450
I'll try to keep up.

289
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,210
That's mighty reassuring!

290
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,000
What's up?

291
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,460
Well, here I go!

292
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,100
Hey, wait! What're you doing?!

293
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,670
Coup de...

294
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,420
...Vent!

295
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,510
What?!

296
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,770
You've demolished the breezeway!

297
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,980
And there you have it.

298
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,710
You're rather violent.

299
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,170
Cien Fleurs!

300
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,330
Wing!

301
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,930
What?!

302
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,270
Dude, you can fly?!

303
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,640
Yes...

304
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,860
For about five seconds.

305
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,810
That's not long!

306
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,270
But it's long enough.

307
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,740
Strong Right!

308
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,320
Sweet! I latched on.

309
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,210
If we can make it to that entrance,
we'll be able to go after Straw Hat!

310
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,410
I'm sorry. I can't keep this up...

311
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,420
Reel back in, arm!

312
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,880
I hope we make it in time!

313
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,380
What?!

314
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,170
All of them fell into the courtyard.

315
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,540
I doubt that finished them off...

316
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,970
...but we won't have to
worry about them for a while.

317
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,120
That worked out nicely.

318
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,000
Man, you're horrible!
How dare you step on me?!

319
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,860
Who do you think you are?!

320
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,130
We can't go back this way.

321
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,800
Hey, you! I know you can hear me!

322
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,850
Don't blow me off! Hey!

323
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,430
What is it?

324
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,200
Tch! They sure are tough.

325
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,240
Curse you! I'll get you scumballs for this!

326
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,450
I'm a spider! I can climb
right back up there!

327
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,800
You'd better prepare yourselves!

328
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,880
Huh?

329
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,810
Something's falling?

330
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,310
No, someone's raining down on us!

331
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,150
What is that?

332
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,490
This bag of bones goes...

333
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,370
Ka-bone!

334
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,510
Hey, hey, hey! Who just flew in from the sky?

335
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,050
Wait. Look at his outfit.

336
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,550
Oh, I see! That cane!

337
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,100
Right! And that hair...!

338
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,140
Well, I have a good idea who it is now.

339
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,310
And from the sky! In-cane-ceivable!

340
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

341
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,650
"Appearing from the Sky!
That Man Is the Humming Swordsman!"

342
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,810
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
