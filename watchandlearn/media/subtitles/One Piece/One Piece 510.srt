2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,240
Luffy lost his brother Ace in the
War of the Best against the Navy

60
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,660
and has come face to face
with Dark King Rayleigh.

61
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,080
What are you gonna do, Luffy-kun?

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,790
Meanwhile, the rest of the Straw Hats...

63
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,310
...have all gotten underway

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,840
in order to keep their promise
to each other and Luffy.

65
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,920
Okay.

66
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
I made up my mind.

67
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,900
I'm gonna go back.

68
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,130
To Marineford!

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,720
"A Disaster for Sanji!
The Queen's Return to the Kingdom!"

70
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,960
Th-This is a Navy ship #204.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,860
We demand permission to enter.

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,770
You're right on time.

73
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,360
Okay, may I have your code number?

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,200
The code number is 5963.

75
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,730
Code number, confirmed.
Open the Gate of Justice.

76
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,580
Yes, sir!

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,220
Crank.

78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,050
Alright, well done.

79
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,960
Luffy-kun, how are you feeling?

80
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,710
I feel fine now. Not bad at all.

81
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,290
The former Warlord - "First
Son of the Sea" Jimbei!

82
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,890
The former first mate of
the King of the Pirates -

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,930
Dark King Silvers Rayleigh!

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,900
And Straw Hat Luffy! What do they want?!

85
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,730
Meanwhile, in the Birdie Kingdom...

86
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,750
BIRDIE KINGDOM

87
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,750
...where the birds and the
humans have stopped fighting.

88
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,110
Are you really leaving now,
Racoon? We just became friends.

89
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,330
Uh-huh, I read in the newspaper
about my friend's ordeal

90
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,760
so I wanna get back as soon as possible.

91
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,140
I can't believe what happened to...

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,480
...Luffy's brother, who I met in Alabasta!

93
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,560
I wanna see Luffy soon and
give him medical attention.

94
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,280
He must've pushed himself as always.

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,430
Racoon!

96
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm glad that you and the
birds cleared the air!

97
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,830
That's because you risked
your life and talked to them.

98
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,120
Well...

99
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,920
You guys, live in peace with these humans!

100
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,670
All they want are the various
plants that grow on that tree!

101
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,690
That's right! We don't want your
eggs and we won't hurt you!

102
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,680
We're different from those who chased
you away from your home island!

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,210
Now that you mention it,

104
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,020
the medicine that you make out of the
plants on that tree really works!

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,780
My wound healed already.

106
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,280
Of course it did! This medicine
is passed on from father to son.

107
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,620
To be honest, I wanna stay on
this island and study the plants!

108
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,710
I'm sure there are ingredients unfamiliar
to me. But I don't have time.

109
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,130
Come see us again!

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,130
That's right! You're always welcome, Racoon!

111
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,590
Yeah? I'm happy to hear that!

112
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,680
When I see my friends, I'll
tell them about this country!

113
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,150
And I'll come to see you all again!

114
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,570
Take this. It's a long journey
and you'll get hungry.

115
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,030
Thanks.

116
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,120
Come see us, Racoon!

117
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,620
Oh, cotton candy!

118
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,160
Alright, guys, be nice to each other!

119
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,120
Goodbye, Racoon!

120
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,590
Okay, I got a box lunch
and some cotton candy!

121
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,820
I'm gonna head for the meeting spot now!

122
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,220
I don't have a pirate ship!

123
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,640
Even if I had one, I don't have a navigator!

124
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,350
So I don't know how to get to Sabaody!

125
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,100
Well, I'll just get on any ship...
No, then I'm gonna get lost!

126
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,580
Oh, what am I gonna do?!

127
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,610
R-Racoon...

128
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,570
Damn! I gotta fulfill my role as
the doctor of the pirates! Luffy!

129
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,060
Huh? What did you say?

130
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,130
Your father will give me a ride?

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,830
Yeah, see you!

132
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,460
It's really high and fast!

133
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,920
I'll make it there in a matter of seconds!

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,170
Huh? You can do better?

135
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,600
Cool!

136
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,020
It's like a roller-coaster!

137
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,610
I feel sick... I got carried away...

138
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,830
Hey, News Coo! Give me the newspaper!

139
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,370
I'll read it as I eat my lunch.

140
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,250
The information about the war
should be updated by now.

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,460
Yum!

142
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,630
You've got to be kidding me!

143
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,000
Why?! What's going on?!

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,570
What made Luffy do this...?!

145
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,950
Meanwhile, in the East Blue,

146
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,030
EAST BLUE - ON THE GIANT BRIDGE--

147
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,030
Robin has been freed by the
Revolutionaries army and...

148
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,260
--You saved me!
--Revolutionaries army, thanks for coming!

149
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm glad!

150
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,240
Robin!

151
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,510
Soran!

152
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,680
It's great. Can everybody
be free from now on?

153
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,310
Yes.

154
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,390
At least, you're not gonna be
forced to build the bridge.

155
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,360
Hey...

156
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,990
Will you accept this?

157
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,460
Thank you, Soran.

158
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,960
You're leaving, aren't you, Robin?

159
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,960
Yes.

160
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,340
Robin!

161
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,720
Can I see you again?

162
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,280
Robin-san.

163
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,870
Are you gonna head for Sabaody?

164
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,080
Yes.

165
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,210
"The light of revolution."

166
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,920
We've called you that and searched
for you for more than 10 years.

167
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,100
You're the only survivor from Ohara,

168
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,560
the country that fought against the world.

169
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,140
When we find you,

170
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,690
we have to protect you from
the Government at any cost!

171
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,230
That's what the boss told us.

172
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,480
Boss?

173
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,110
The leader of the Revolutionaries
army - Dragon.

174
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,160
Luffy's father...

175
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,330
What a curious turn of fate!

176
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,830
I beg you again.

177
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,630
Please meet our boss! I'll take you to him.

178
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,090
I can't. I have to return somewhere.

179
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,480
Besides that, you don't need to protect me.

180
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,600
Because I have friends.

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,520
You mean the members of
the Straw Hat Pirates.

182
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes.

183
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Then, let us give you a lift
part of the way at least.

184
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,690
You can't see the end of this bridge
even if you walk for several days.

185
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,410
Let us take you wherever you're going.

186
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,290
We'll be able to unlock the
3rd and 4th prisons soon!

187
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,440
Roger that.

188
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,210
Tell the others to get ready for
the release of the prisoners.

189
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,440
Yes, sir!

190
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,390
Can I ask you something?

191
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,800
Anything.

192
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,880
Why does the Revolutionaries army need me?

193
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,920
Th-That's because...

194
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,680
You'll see several ghost towns before
we get to the end of the bridge.

195
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,110
That's because the whole country
moved as the construction progressed.

196
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,190
For your information, the site
you see is from 300 years ago.

197
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,360
Why are they building this bridge?

198
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,990
It's an order from the World
Nobles - Celestial Dragons.

199
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,280
Celestial Dragons?

200
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,370
I don't care if there is a reason or not!

201
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,040
It wouldn't bring down the death
toll of those they call slaves!

202
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,550
Did you see Straw Hat Luffy -
Dragon-san's son in today's newspaper?

203
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes. He went missing after the war,

204
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,400
but he showed up again and did such a thing.

205
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,560
We have to show this
article to Nico Robin now.

206
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,520
She's worrying about him.

207
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,900
I don't think they got to the end yet.

208
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,720
Oh, thank you!

209
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,860
For you, Robin-san.

210
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,040
Luffy! I'm glad he's okay!

211
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,750
What is it? Is there something funny?

212
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,210
Yes.

213
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,960
Meanwhile, on Peachy Island---

214
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,750
Kamabakka
Kingdom, the island for New Kamas...

215
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,930
GRAND LINE PEACHY ISLAND - KAMABAKKA KINGDOM

216
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:34,640
I said "Give me a ship!" I
have a promise to fulfill!

217
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,430
I've wasted so much time fooling
around with you people!

218
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,130
With that excuse, candy-chan,

219
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,910
you're just trying to
escape from this island!

220
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,570
We won't let you do that!

221
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,440
Yeah, that's absolutely right!

222
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,130
Of course, I wanna get out of this country

223
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,440
that's completely devoid of women!

224
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,640
What is that ship there?

225
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,210
I-It's Ivan-sama! Ivan-sama is on it!

226
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,760
Huh? Who is it?

227
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,350
Hey, what's wrong? Is that person that great?

228
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,960
She's the queen of Kamabakka Kingdom...

229
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,450
...Emporio Ivankov-sama!

230
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,100
What?! That name was in...

231
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
She's the queer queen in
the newspaper?

232
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,580
How timely!

233
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,450
She was with Luffy so I bet she knows a lot.

234
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,360
It's been awhile.

235
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,380
Can't believe it!

236
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,760
Sh-She's my type!

237
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,120
No, wait, wait!

238
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,850
She's here because she's a queer, too.

239
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,060
I almost fell for it!

240
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,230
Who are you?

241
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,480
I-I am...

242
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,030
Her breasts are sticking out!

243
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,320
Her ass looks so tight!

244
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,280
No, I won't be fooled!

245
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,330
Do you want something from me, candy boy?

246
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,460
Yeah, I have a lot of
questions for you! First...

247
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,550
...what's your favorite type of man?

248
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,460
No, I mean, about Luffy!

249
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,470
Luffy? You mean Straw boy?

250
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,890
Bingo!

251
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,720
So you were at the Navy
Headquarters with him!

252
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,140
Luffy, you're so lucky!

253
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,480
I mean, you guys must've been through a lot.

254
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,780
Tell me everything.

255
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,690
My lady...

256
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,930
And who are you?

257
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,750
Dammit! I knew it was coming! Screw you!

258
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,130
And how do you know Straw boy?!

259
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,170
I'm one of his crew.

260
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,500
His crew?!

261
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,010
--So this is a wanted poster of Straw boy.
--Yes, it is.

262
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,850
And this is "Pirate Hunter" Zoro.

263
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,720
Don't know him!

264
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,480
This is "Cat Burglar" Nami.

265
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,770
This is "The King of Snipers" Sogeking.

266
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,150
Uh-huh.

267
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,320
And this is you.

268
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,200
No!

269
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,410
See?! You're not in these posters!

270
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,080
Then there's no proof that
you're one of Straw boy's!

271
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,450
I told you that I am!

272
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,250
Tell me how is Luffy doing
now, you queer king!

273
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,420
I know that you were with
him from the newspaper!

274
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,130
Then, is this you?

275
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,080
I said that it's not...

276
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,890
It's not but it is...

277
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,720
The name is mine.

278
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,190
Why are you struggling so much?!

279
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,150
That's... me! That is me!

280
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,200
That weird guy on that poster
is definitely me so...

281
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,540
No, it looks nothing like you!

282
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,630
Then, don't make me say it!

283
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,460
I threw up blood, you fool!

284
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,340
It's no use.

285
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,410
Even if it's only 0.1 %, as
long as there is a chance

286
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,090
that you're a puppet from
the Navy or Government

287
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,220
I won't tell you any of the
information concerning Straw boy!

288
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,520
I understand. Then let me borrow a ship.

289
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,350
I'm gonna go to the meeting spot.

290
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,810
I won't give you a ship.

291
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,230
Then, I'll swim!

292
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,720
What did you just say?!

293
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,990
So you're not just saying
that you're his crew!

294
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,990
I have no choice. You've touched my heart.

295
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,080
For the sake of your passion, I'll
tell you what happened to Straw boy...

296
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,000
...Or not! Heehaw!

297
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,800
--So you won't tell him?
--You fooled us there!

298
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,340
Ivan-sama!

299
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,000
Shut up, you fools!

300
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,890
Damn...

301
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,270
Looks like his defenses are down!

302
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,270
Now is the chance! Dress him
up with the sweets dress!

303
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,360
I'll never wear it again! Back off!

304
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,510
I'm a true manly man who loves ladies!

305
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,980
Stay away from me, fools!

306
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,490
Boo! Boo!

307
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,640
Hey, so your name is Ivan, right?

308
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,120
I decided to steal a ship
because I'm a pirate!

309
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,710
You gotta fight me one-on-one!

310
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,660
Alright!

311
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,420
Now, Ivan-sama,

312
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,040
the grand master of Kamabakka
style - New Kama Kempo...

313
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,430
...vs. "Black Foot" Sanji!
A 3 minute one-game match!

314
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,190
Even her stand-in was very
strong. She must be formidable!

315
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,440
I'll go all out from the start!

316
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,730
Fight!

317
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,710
Diable Jambe!

318
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,320
Premier Hachis!

319
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,580
Wh-What a powerful kick!

320
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,410
I-I should be strong but I'm gonna fall...

321
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,210
...gonna fall...

322
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,750
...fall...

323
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,600
...Or not!

324
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,640
Heehaw!

325
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,600
You're not gonna fall?! You got me there!

326
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,640
Seems like you're a staunch boy.

327
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,230
But I think you need to be disciplined.

328
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,520
What?

329
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,530
New Kama Kempo: 44 - Aesthetic Technique!

330
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,870
Hair Removal Fist!

331
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,570
Death Wink!

332
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,210
Hell Wink!

333
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,620
Galaxy Wink!

334
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,220
I'll tell you how Straw
boy is doing, Spiral boy!

335
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,350
Why did you change your mind?

336
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,060
Because the whole world knows about it now.

337
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,880
I wonder what he is thinking.

338
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,190
It's in today's newspaper?

339
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,820
Luffy!

340
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,740
Ivan-san, there is a call
for you from Baltigo.

341
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,780
Oh yeah?

342
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,910
Go to the transmission facility.

343
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,920
GRAND LINE LAND OF WHITE SOIL - BALTIGO

344
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,960
Because of the recent war,

345
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,250
people know so much about you now, Dragon!

346
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,050
Didn't it make your men upset?

347
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,120
Looks like they're relieved to
know that their enigmatic boss

348
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,100
was a human after all.

349
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,060
It doesn't matter now.
Luffy is not a kid anymore.

350
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,060
But I can't believe that you were with him.

351
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,530
It must be a trick of fortune, huh?

352
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,820
Anyway, it was an unexpected
prison break for me and Inazuma.

353
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,570
I have a lot of things I want to discuss
with you and even more questions.

354
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,300
Yeah, I bet.

355
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,640
We need to quickly summon our
commanders from all over the world.

356
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,200
The death of Whitebeard

357
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,390
will change the world situation
and the Government regime.

358
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,180
On top of that, I have to tell
you what happened to Kuma.

359
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,350
Yes, I want the details.

360
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,350
What made him obey the Government?

361
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,690
The Kuma that I knew is gone now.

362
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,560
He tried to kill me!

363
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,190
Oh, by the way, Dragon, have
you read the newspaper today?

364
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,700
Straw boy has surprised me once again!

365
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,320
He's as wild as his father.

366
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,990
I can't believe he did such
a thing in Marineford!

367
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,630
The Navy HQ was heavily damaged
in the War of the Best.

368
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,950
Luffy returns to the place where he lost Ace,

369
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,350
this time with Rayleigh
and Jimbei at his side.

370
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,360
The miraculous news would bring great shock

371
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,350
to his friends, as well
as to the whole world!

372
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

373
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,030
"Unexpected Relanding! Luffy, to Marineford!"

374
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,510
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
