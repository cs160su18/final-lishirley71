2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,920
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,190
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,440
Chopper, were you able
to find any medicinal herbs?

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,400
Yep. I've collected most of them,

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,110
but there may be even rarer ones on this island.

26
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,240
More importantly, something's
been bugging me for a while.

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,700
I wonder what this weird groove
is that runs down this path...

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,500
Come to think of it, yeah, I wonder what it is.

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,670
It looks as if a bicycle passed by.

30
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,790
We're suddenly out in a large open space.

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,350
Ahh... Hmm?

32
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,850
A raccoon dog?

33
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,640
I'm a reindeer! See? I've got antlers!

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,430
Are you okay, Chopper?!

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,020
Who the heck is this?!

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,610
Luffy, what happened?!

37
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,020
What's with you guys?

38
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,980
What's with you?!

39
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,030
Wh-Who's that huge guy?

40
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,530
Who's that guy?!

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Robin...

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:17,210
"Navy Headquarters Admiral Aokiji!
The Ferocity of an Ultimate Powerhouse"

43
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,940
To think that he got Robin this shaken up...

44
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,530
Who is he?

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,120
He's a marine.

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,630
Navy Headquarters Admiral... Aokiji.

47
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,790
Admiral?!

48
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,960
A... Admiral? He's that high up?

49
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,100
There're only three officers in the Navy
who hold the position of Admiral.

50
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,850
Akainu...

51
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,600
Aokiji...

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,770
Kizaru...

53
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,110
The only one above them

54
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,280
is Fleet Admiral Sengoku, who reigns
as the top official in the Navy.

55
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,780
That man is one of the three men

56
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,450
called the World Government's
ultimate powerhouses.

57
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,950
Wh-Why is someone like that here?!

58
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,710
Why don't you go deal with big-time pirates
with several-hundred-million-Berry bounties?!

59
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,670
G... Go someplace else!

60
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,210
Hm?

61
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,250
Oh, my, my...

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,800
Wh-What?

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,010
Here's another sexy lady with super
big bazongas! Are you free tonight?

64
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,220
What's the big idea, you tall, lanky jerk?!

65
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,760
Pay attention, you jerk!

66
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,100
Hold on a sec, you guys, geez...

67
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Did you hear what I said?

68
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,020
I said I just took a stroll, didn't I?
Don't get so worked up.

69
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,860
To start with, you guys are...
whatchamacallit... you know...

70
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,860
"Wh-Whatchamacallit"?

71
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,610
"You know..."?

72
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,120
Err...

73
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,040
I forgot. Oh, well.

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,000
You don't make much sense!

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,870
What the heck's with this guy?!

76
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,370
Hey, Robin, aren't you
mistaking him for someone else?

77
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,540
There's no way someone
like him is a Navy Admiral!

78
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,800
Hey, hey... Don't judge
others by their appearance.

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,510
My motto as a marine is "total slovenly justice."

80
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,180
That totally matches your appearance!

81
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,600
In any case, well...

82
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,480
Oh, excuse me for a sec...

83
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,400
Standing made me tired. Umph.

84
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,150
Then why were you sleeping standing up?

85
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,280
Anyway, to make a long story short,

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,240
I have no intention of capturing
you guys, so don't worry.

87
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,120
I came to check the whereabouts

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,910
of Nico Robin, who disappeared
after the Alabasta incident, that's all.

89
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,290
Just as I thought, she's been with you guys.

90
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,000
This guy sure is apathetic, isn't he?

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,250
His audacity shows he's a leader,
in a manner of speaking.

92
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,380
I'm going to at least report
this to Headquarters, though,

93
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,720
as with another wanted person, the total
bounty for you guys has now changed.

94
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,850
100 million... plus 60 million...
plus 79 million equals...

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
I don't know exactly, but I'm
sure it's not too shabby.

96
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,150
Why don't you calculate it?

97
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,280
Gum-Gum...

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,570
Hold on a sec! Hold on, Luffy!

99
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,620
Stop it! Stop it!

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,410
Let me go! What're you guys doing?!

101
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,200
What's the point in us picking a fight?!

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,040
He's one of the strongest marines!

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,630
So what?! Then are you saying we're
gonna hand over Robin without a fight?!

104
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,630
You jerk!

105
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,090
Well, you guys... I'm saying I'm
not gonna do anything, aren't I?

106
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,630
I'm gonna beat him up!

107
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,800
Stop it, Luffy!

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,840
Hold on!

109
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,980
S-So you're a marine...
I wish you had told us sooner.

110
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
--Hm?
--Who are these people?

111
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,770
Hey, get hold of yourselves.

112
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,610
Then this isn't an uninhabited island?

113
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,070
Well, they're probably the passengers
who drifted here from a wrecked ship.

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,490
About a month ago,

115
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,670
there was a report that a passenger
liner went missing in this area.

116
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,840
How are they, Chopper?

117
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,510
There're some injured people,
but their wounds aren't serious.

118
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,340
They'll be fine once I apply the medicine I have.

119
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,260
More importantly, it seems that
they haven't been eating well.

120
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,310
They're weakened.

121
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,310
Sanji-kun and Usopp went to get some food.

122
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,270
Hey! We're back!

123
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,780
You must've been really hungry.

124
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,700
You don't have to wolf down the food.

125
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,160
There's plenty more where that came from.

126
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,330
That's right! There's plenty more!

127
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,120
Hey, why are you eating?!

128
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,370
At any rate, even if this is an uninhabited island,

129
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,460
if you are so inclined,
you can find food, you know.

130
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,540
This is the problem with amateurs.

131
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,670
I'm surprised that you survived
after a shipwreck in the Grand Line.

132
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,640
We're the only ones who made it to this island.

133
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,100
What happened?

134
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:23,480
On our way back from a gourmet
tour to the gourmet town, Pucci...

135
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,150
...our ship collided with a huge frog
that was doing the front crawl

136
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,570
and shattered into pieces.

137
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,110
Doing the front crawl?! A frog was?!

138
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,780
Frogs normally do the breaststroke, though.

139
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,660
Interesting! I wanna see it, too!

140
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,450
--Are you out of your mind?
--It's true!

141
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,500
That's Yokozuna.

142
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,540
--Huh?
--Yokozuna?

143
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,590
Then, after a great struggle,
we were able to make it to this island,

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,630
yet we lived on the verge
of starvation for a month.

145
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,220
We rejoiced when we saw someone was coming,

146
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220
but when we looked carefully,
he was riding a bicycle on the sea.

147
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,430
Hey, now... Under no
circumstances can one ride a...

148
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,310
Oh... that was me.

149
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,900
--Huh?
--And then, the next one
that came was a pirate ship.

150
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,690
Us, huh?

151
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,150
Then you guys are... whatchamacallit...

152
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,620
...you know... um... well...

153
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,700
Say it clearly! Clearly!

154
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,450
Oh, shoot! I totally forgot!

155
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,910
Hey, you! Don't mess with us!

156
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,250
--L-Luffy! Hold on! Hold on!
--Calm down!

157
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,210
Well, like I said...

158
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,630
Like I said several times already, I took a stroll.

159
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,430
Oh, it was a stroll? Then don't go
passing a place like this! Leave!

160
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,260
You don't make sense.

161
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,180
Luffy kinda has the upper hand here.

162
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,770
Well, then... Okay.
I'm going back, but before that...

163
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,980
You guys, get ready to depart right away.

164
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,570
Fortunately, there's an inhabited
island not so far from here.

165
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,280
You should go there to get
the treatment you need.

166
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,000
Hey, you guys! You don't have to
listen to this guy! He's a marine!

167
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,500
Is there a problem?

168
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,260
Oh... That's right. It's fine,
it's fine. That's right. It's fine.

169
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,640
Normally, marines are your friends
and we are the bad guys, huh?

170
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,770
It's no time for laughing!

171
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,680
He said he'd help those guys.

172
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,520
But does he have a ship?

173
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,770
Besides ours, I didn't see
any other ships anywhere.

174
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,400
There's no ship. They don't
have a Log Pose, either.

175
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,160
How are they supposed to
go to that nearby island?

176
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,120
Oh, they'll be fine.

177
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,990
Nothing you say sounds convincing, you know.

178
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,120
It's true that...

179
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,120
Hm?

180
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,750
...that man can make it happen.

181
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,010
All right, done!

182
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,640
We loaded up food and water.
With this much, you'll be fine for a while.

183
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,440
It's nice to work once in a while.

184
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,480
Yeah, it feels good! You're quite a sensible guy!

185
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
He hit it off with him after all.

186
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,070
So what're you gonna do?

187
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,410
Are you gonna swim while
pulling these guys and this stuff?

188
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,280
No way.

189
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,240
Step back a bit.

190
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,060
Wh-What the heck?!

191
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,980
A sea animal! I bet that's the
guardian of this area of the sea!

192
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,780
What?! Hey, you! Run!

193
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,240
Watch out! Gum-Gum...

194
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,290
Ice Age...

195
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,350
Devil Fruit...!

196
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,440
Th-The sea... froze!

197
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,070
This is the power of a
Navy Headquarters' Admiral.

198
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,770
This will probably last at least a week.

199
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,530
Take your time and head in that direction.

200
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,450
You'll get to an inhabited island in four days.

201
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,380
It's a little cold, so dress warmly while walking.

202
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,460
Is this... a dream?

203
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,590
The sea has become ground!

204
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,850
We can now cross the sea!
We can get off of this island!

205
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,810
Mr. Marine! Thank you!

206
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,270
This is a miracle! A miracle without doubt!

207
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,250
Well then, we'll get going now.

208
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,660
Yeah. I'm happy for you guys.

209
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,830
Be careful.

210
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,710
I guess there're different kinds of pirates, huh?

211
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,880
We can't thank you enough.

212
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,050
Not only did you treat our injured,

213
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,260
but you also shared your
food and water with us.

214
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,300
Don't worry about it.

215
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,720
They say that even a chance meeting is
due to karma from a previous life, so...

216
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,180
Take good care of the children
so that they don't catch a cold.

217
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,110
In this state, the food will
probably stay fresh for a while.

218
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,270
--Bye-bye!
--Thank you very much.

219
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,400
--Thank you!
--We'll never forget your kindness,
Straw Hat Pirates!

220
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,410
See ya! Take care!

221
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,370
Be careful on your trip!

222
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,330
Good, good.

223
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,000
Whoa, it's cold. It's cold.

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,170
This is completely like winter.

225
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,790
I can ice skate!

226
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,760
Whoa! That's amazing, Chopper!

227
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,630
Just as you'd expect from
someone born on a winter island!

228
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,760
How about this?

229
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,010
Whoa! That's amazing!

230
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,140
Why don't you try?

231
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,430
Boy, it's cold, it's cold!

232
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,310
I'm gonna freeze!

233
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,770
Hm?

234
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,690
Hmm...

235
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,030
What?

236
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,490
How should I put it... You're just
like your gramps, Monkey D. Luffy...

237
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,570
Wh-What?

238
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,040
You're free-spirited, or should
I say you're hard to figure out?

239
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,420
G-Gramps...

240
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,170
Gramps...?! Luffy's?!

241
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,510
Hey, what's the matter, Luffy?
You're drenched in sweat.

242
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,180
Well... N-N-Nothing. Um... well...

243
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,390
Your gramps really helped me out a while back.

244
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,690
The reason I came here was to
have a look at Nico Robin and you.

245
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,860
On second thought...
maybe you should die now, huh?

246
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,870
The government is still taking you guys lightly,

247
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,830
but if I delve into your history, I can
tell that your group has a backbone.

248
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,080
Although your group is small,
since it's gathering shrewd members,

249
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,710
it'll probably become a problem later on.

250
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,340
The circumstances that initially
led to your search orders...

251
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,180
All the actions you took up until now...

252
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,300
The speed of your group's progress...

253
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,520
I've been dealing with outlaws for a long time,

254
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,270
but it worries me to think how you'll turn out.

255
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,020
Th-That's too sudden!

256
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,110
You said earlier that you just
came to check things out!

257
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,860
The reason I especially regard
you guys as dangerous is...

258
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,570
...you, Nico Robin.

259
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,620
So you're after Robin after all!
I'm gonna beat the crap out of you!

260
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,830
Her bounty amount isn't just
an indication of her strength.

261
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,580
It also indicates the level of danger
she poses to the government.

262
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:15,050
That's why you got a 79-million-Berry
bounty on your head at the age of eight.

263
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,850
I'm impressed that you survived as a child.

264
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,270
You betrayed people and ran away.
You gained people's favor and used them.

265
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,850
You've survived in the underworld
by being quick to switch sides.

266
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,270
So this is the group that you
chose as your next hideout, huh?

267
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,820
Hey, you jerk! How insulting you are!

268
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,490
What grudge do you hold against Robin-chan?!

269
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,330
Stop it, Sanji!

270
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,240
I don't have any grudge against her.

271
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,000
If we are somehow connected...

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,500
...it's that I let her get
away once, that's about it.

273
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,790
It was a long time ago.

274
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,340
You guys will eventually realize it, too.

275
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,260
In the not-so-distant future, you'll regret
that you took in a troublesome woman.

276
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,770
As proof, the organizations Nico Robin
had something to do with up until today

277
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,980
all got annihilated... except for her.

278
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,020
I wonder why... Nico Robin?

279
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,950
Stop it, you jerk! Her past doesn't matter!

280
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,780
He's right! If you're worried about others' pasts,

281
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,120
you can't be friends with ruffians like
a pirate hunter or a former thief girl!

282
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,160
"Ruffians" was unnecessary!

283
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,160
What's more important is
the present, rather than the past!

284
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,130
Robin is our precious friend now!
Don't badmouth our friend!

285
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,010
I see... You really did a
good job befriending this lot.

286
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,470
Just get to the point already! If you
want to capture me, go ahead and do it!

287
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,930
Treinta Fleurs!

288
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,980
Robin! Stop it!

289
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,900
Oh, my, my... Maybe I talked too much.

290
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,810
How disappointing!

291
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,480
I had too high an opinion of you,
thinking you were a little smarter than that.

292
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,030
Clutch!

293
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,900
Ahhh! He shattered into pieces and died!

294
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,370
N-No... We're screwed...

295
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,500
H-Hey! Guys! Run! Let's get out of here!

296
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,300
That wasn't nice.

297
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,740
Ice Saber!

298
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,490
I wasn't going to kill you, but...

299
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,090
Slice Shoot!

300
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,340
All right!

301
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,390
Hmph! How dare you butt in, you damn cook?

302
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,310
The same to you, you natural monument!

303
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,310
Gum-Gum...

304
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,940
...Pistol!

305
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,610
It's cold!

306
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,000
He froze them!

307
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,290
Those three... all at once...

308
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,810
O-Oh, no! They have to be treated right away!

309
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,940
If they get frostbite, their limbs
will become gangrenous!

310
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,360
What're you doing, Usopp?!
We have to go help those three now!

311
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,860
I-I really would like to,
but my body can't move.

312
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,400
Did I get frozen, too?

313
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,200
No! You're just too scared to move!

314
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,330
--Luffy!
--Sanji! Zoro!

315
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,490
Robin! Run!

316
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,580
You've come across some good friends.

317
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,840
But you're still you, Nico Robin!

318
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,960
No...! I'm no longer...

319
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,720
Robin! Watch out! Run!

320
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm...

321
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,770
Robin-chan!

322
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,150
Robin!

323
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

324
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

325
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

326
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

327
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

328
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

329
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

330
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,090
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

331
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

332
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

333
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

334
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

335
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

336
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

337
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

338
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

339
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,540
Eternally... Eternally...

340
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,960
Ahh! Robin got...!

341
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,170
...frozen!

342
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,050
Don't yell! Her death will benefit the world.

343
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,090
--What'd you say?!
--You bastard!

344
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,760
--Wait, you guys!
--Luffy!

345
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,930
Don't interfere in this fight!
I'll fight him in a duel!

346
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,640
That's fine by me, but...
err... whatchamacallit...?

347
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

348
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,440
"Duel between Rubber and Ice! Luffy vs. Aokiji"

349
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
