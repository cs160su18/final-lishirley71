2
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,910
When the Thousand Sunny
drifted into unknown waters,

3
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,900
the crew landed on Hungry-la Island,
an island brimming with strange foods,

4
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,690
to restock their exhausted food supplies.

5
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,960
There they met the Gourmet Hunter
Toriko and the chef Komatsu,

6
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,240
and they teamed up to capture
the legendary Hungry-la Bird.

7
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Gum-Gum Gatling!

8
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,960
Fork!

9
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,290
Knife!

10
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,420
Thank you for this excellent meal.

11
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,560
And so, the time passed
on their lively feast...

12
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,930
Now this goes in...

13
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,310
Hey, could I get some more soup?

14
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,980
Just a moment, please.

15
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,780
Here we go...

16
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,710
What's that?

17
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,730
They're spice seeds.

18
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,490
When I put these in, the spices take
effect and change the soup's flavor.

19
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,780
"The Strongest Tag-Team!
Luffy and Toriko's Hard Struggle!"

20
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,090
Whew, I'm stuffed!

21
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
That Hungry-la Bird was delicious!

22
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,050
You're really not going to include this
Hungry-la Bird in your Full Course Meal?

23
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,380
Yeah, that's the thing...

24
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,480
What's wrong?

25
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,560
He says Komatsu and Nami are gone!

26
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,030
What left these tracks?

27
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,320
Something smells good.

28
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,680
It's the aroma of fine cocoa.

29
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,370
These tracks were definitely
left by Cocoalas.

30
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,790
Cocoalas?

31
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,460
I've never seen one myself,
but they're Capture Level 3.

32
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,340
Their meat doesn't taste good enough to eat,

33
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,050
but sweet cocoa beans of the highest
quality grow on their backs.

34
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,340
Something that fancy took
Nami-san and the chef?

35
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,430
No, they probably carried
them back to their nest.

36
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,430
Cocoalas are omnivorous.

37
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,010
They'll take anything and store it as food.

38
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,730
And they make their nests
in Multi-fruit Trees.

39
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,570
Multi-fruit?

40
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,030
A fruit that combines the
sweet and savory flavors

41
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,820
of wintermelons, watermelons,
apples, mangos, and other fruits.

42
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,680
It's also known as the
Fruit Parlor of the Earth!

43
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,250
I'd love to eat one!

44
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,230
You're more worried about
food than about your friend?!

45
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,860
So where can we find these things?

46
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,350
In order to grow the sweetest fruit,

47
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,510
Multi-fruit Trees are said to grow
where the sunlight is most abundant.

48
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,940
Found it!

49
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,960
So that's it?

50
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,730
There's no doubt. That's Multi-fruit!

51
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,120
Nami-san! I'm coming!

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,990
Just you wait, Multi-fruit!

53
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,610
I feel so sorry for Komatsu right now...

54
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,870
Luffy... What happened to our food?

55
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,220
Luffy...

56
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,340
Usopp...

57
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,540
You've aged a lot.

58
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,500
At this rate, you're gonna
end up all bones, like Brook.

59
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,980
Nice skull joke...

60
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,990
Still...

61
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,980
What's this vapor?

62
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,860
A geyser?

63
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,860
Yow!

64
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,200
Look out!

65
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,730
You don't know where they'll burst up from!

66
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,640
That's really hot!

67
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,920
But it's sweet! It's chocolate!

68
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,590
What?! Really?!

69
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,460
Quit making your eyes sparkle and just run!

70
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,550
While we're doing this, Nami-san is...

71
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,470
What's that?

72
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,470
A big one's coming!

73
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,040
Hot!

74
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,290
Crap! A river!

75
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,070
What's wrong?

76
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,970
People with Devil Fruit powers can't swim!

77
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,780
What?!

78
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,460
Huh? This isn't water.

79
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,600
Cream?

80
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,710
It's a river of whipped cream!

81
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,000
Tasty!

82
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,160
All right, not much longer now!

83
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,900
Once we're through this forest,
we'll be at the Multi-Fruit Tree.

84
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,400
What was that?!

85
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,260
I knew it. A Caste Leo.

86
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,870
Caste Leo?

87
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,450
Caste Leo (Mammal Beast) Capture Level 4

88
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,610
Capture Level 4.

89
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,000
Their manes are exquisite,
fluffy castella cake!

90
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,260
Growling in that super deep voice...
Is this supposed to be a joke?

91
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,580
We're going to where Nami and Komatsu are!

92
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,640
I won't let anyone get in our
way, no matter who it is!

93
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,270
Luffy!

94
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,570
What is that?

95
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,820
Sound shock waves!

96
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,990
His castella sponge cake emits sound.

97
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,360
It's like a giant speaker.

98
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,500
Isn't there any way to beat it?

99
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,300
Well, can you draw his
attacks straight ahead?

100
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,960
Right!

101
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,500
Okay, now!

102
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,420
Toriko!

103
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,470
His sound attack only works
directly in front of him!

104
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,590
We can get him from the sides!

105
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,720
Threefold

106
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,170
Nail Punch!

107
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,260
Amazing!

108
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,650
What was that?!

109
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,080
I drive multiple punches into one
spot, like hammering in nails.

110
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
It's my Nail Punch.

111
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,750
There were this many of them?

112
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,560
And they're huge.

113
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,650
These guys roam in prides.

114
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,390
Five Caste Leos and one small Caste Leo...

115
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,990
Looks like we're surrounded.

116
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,210
What?!

117
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,840
Spatula!

118
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,940
Such a beautiful way to make an entrance.

119
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,210
Sunny!

120
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,740
Poison Rifle!

121
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,950
Endorphin Smoke!

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,670
What now?!

123
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,790
It suddenly got quiet.

124
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,340
Hey, Toriko.

125
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,960
Coco! Rin!

126
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,710
Toriko! I'm so glad you're safe!

127
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,160
An angel has come down!

128
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,300
Wow! They're your friends, Toriko?

129
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,990
Well, yeah...

130
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,600
But what are you doing here?

131
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,740
We heard that you had set out
to capture a Hungry-la Bird,

132
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,530
so we came to tell you the
secret of Hungry-la Island...

133
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,440
Anyway! I can't believe you left
me behind! You're awful, Toriko!

134
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,640
It was so hard to find this island!

135
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,820
I'm so mad!

136
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,490
By the way...

137
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,730
Where's Komatsu-kun?

138
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,410
Actually, he was taken by Cocoalas.

139
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,690
What?!

140
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,080
Yeah! Our friend is with him, too!

141
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,050
That creature is unreal! It talked!

142
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,430
They've recovered, huh?

143
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,890
We don't have time to deal with these guys!

144
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,950
Quick! We've gotta go save Nami!

145
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,970
These guys are gonna be a pain, though.

146
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,600
Beautiful...

147
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,540
A heart that cares for its friends...

148
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,270
That is more beautiful than anything.

149
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,010
Toriko, leave this to us,
and go save Komatsu.

150
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,550
We'll be fine on our own!

151
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,450
You guys...

152
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,920
All of you, hurry!

153
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,740
Thanks!

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,540
I'm counting on you!

155
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,790
I'll get that Multi-fruit, no matter what!

156
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,110
Multi-fruit?

157
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,660
What about Komatsu-kun?

158
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,920
Does it seem like Toriko's goal
is different from everyone else's?

159
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
Well, in any case...

160
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,060
We will take you on!

161
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,140
What is it, Toriko?

162
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,700
Oh, I was just wondering why the Caste
Leos didn't attack the Cocoalas,

163
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,400
since their Capture Level is lower.

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
Huh?

165
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,680
To get to the top of the mountain,

166
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,240
the Cocoalas must have passed
through the Caste Leos' area.

167
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,170
Carrying Komatsu and your friend
would've slowed the Cocoalas down.

168
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,490
They should've been prime
prey for the Caste Leos.

169
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,170
And they were obviously hungry.

170
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,830
There must be some reason why
they didn't eat the Cocoalas.

171
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,250
I've got a bad feeling about this.

172
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,980
Put me down, you monster koalas!

173
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,930
This is...

174
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,520
Multi-fruit!

175
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,090
It's my first time seeing them! I'm so moved!

176
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,820
Huh?!

177
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,080
I wonder what they taste like...

178
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,700
I wonder how they should be cooked
to bring out their flavors...

179
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,510
Forget about that!

180
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,370
Think about what's happening
to you right now!

181
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,010
That's Nami-san's voice!

182
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,640
Sanji!

183
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,800
Nami-san!

184
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,020
Koalas... Huh?

185
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,940
Luffy! Sanji-kun!

186
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,690
Toriko-san!

187
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,130
Nami!

188
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,610
That's...

189
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,440
A Knock-out Koala!

190
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,410
So he's their boss?

191
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,190
Knock-out Koala (Marsupial Beast) Capture Level 5

192
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,910
They say that when Cocoalas reach
adulthood, they become Knock-out Koalas,

193
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,540
but I've never heard of one getting that big.

194
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,780
Now I know why the Caste Leos
didn't attack the Cocoalas.

195
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,870
They were afraid of the Cocoalas'
boss, the Knock-out Koala!

196
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,140
So now he's shown his true colors.

197
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,560
Oh, boy... So if we don't beat these
guys, we can't save Nami-san anyway?

198
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,070
How are they so fast?!

199
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,410
So the Capture Level of Cocoalas
in battle mode exceeds 3, eh?

200
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,120
Hey, Toriko!

201
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,810
Luffy! Toriko!

202
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,820
Hey!

203
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,440
You guys can handle things here!

204
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,550
What?!

205
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,800
Got it!

206
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,130
Luffy, Toriko! Take care of Nami-san!

207
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,910
Right!

208
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,260
We'll save Nami!

209
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,970
What?!

210
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,970
Um, what about me?!

211
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,270
I won't let you get in
Luffy and Toriko's way!

212
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,780
Something's making a lot of noise.

213
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,860
There's no helping it.

214
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,060
Nothing's gonna happen if
we just wait around here.

215
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,370
Let's take the ship around to
the other side of the island.

216
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,670
I'm too hungry to move...

217
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,990
So this is what they call
"bones broken for nothing"...

218
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,320
And I'm nothing but bones...

219
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,300
Quit your whining! Unfurl the sails!

220
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,370
Luffy!

221
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,270
Toriko-san!

222
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,280
Luffy! You okay?

223
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,140
Yeah!

224
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,320
Damn that thing... It can't
really only be Level 5!

225
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,040
Not bad!

226
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,330
Hey, you! Give back Nami!

227
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,340
Yeah! Give me the Multi-fruit!

228
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,010
What?! You didn't come to save me?!

229
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,430
Luffy!

230
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,980
Toriko!

231
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,530
It's incredibly strong!

232
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,830
Okay, now it's my turn!

233
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,830
Gum-Gum—

234
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,710
Knife!

235
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,630
Using Nami and Komatsu to shield
yourself is playing dirty!

236
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,440
Toriko!

237
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,290
Nami! Komatsu!

238
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,660
That's a Multi-fruit Tree for you.

239
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,250
Huh?

240
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,960
It can support that Knock-out Koala's
intense movements without even budging.

241
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,590
What's more, the recoil gives
its attack power a huge boost!

242
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,090
Sounds like a pain.

243
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,090
But...

244
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:21,140
Those huge stems must be sending
tons of nutrients to the fruit.

245
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,980
Multi-fruit...

246
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,360
I swear I will eat you!

247
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,940
He's still talking about that?!

248
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,450
Yeah!

249
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,070
Luffy! You, too?!

250
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,950
What are you thinking?!

251
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,120
I give thanks...

252
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,080
...for all this world's bounty.

253
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,040
Now let's eat!

254
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,590
H-Hey!

255
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,190
Gum-Gum...

256
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,600
...Nail Punch!

257
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,900
Thank you for this excellent meal.

258
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,970
Now, I'll just help myself
to that Multi-fruit...

259
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,810
Huh?

260
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,940
What's going on? It's waving around.

261
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,280
Wh-What's happening?

262
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,820
You guys...

263
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,090
Hey, this is unreal!

264
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,080
Huh?

265
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,250
Everyone get down the mountain!

266
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,000
What?!

267
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,520
The island is about to show its true form.

268
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,150
Its true form?

269
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,010
I told you that we came to tell you
the secret of Hungry-la Island, right?

270
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,740
Yeah.

271
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,010
You okay?

272
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,420
It's sweet.

273
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,430
Yum! This is caramel!

274
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,410
What?

275
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,680
It's true!

276
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,620
What's going on?

277
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,780
The legend of Hungry-la
Island has been recorded

278
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,730
in many texts since ancient times.

279
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,430
Our predecessors have transcribed
those texts and handed

280
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,980
them down throughout history to the present.

281
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,390
That's why we relied on the legends
in those texts to find this island

282
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,490
and capture the phantom
ingredient, the Hungry-la Bird.

283
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,410
But it turns out the phantom ingredient
is not the Hungry-la Bird.

284
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,390
Huh?

285
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,500
You know, the characters for
"bird" and "island" look similar.

286
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,670
Hungry-la Bird
Hungry-la Island

287
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,740
Apparently, whoever transcribed
it read the name wrong.

288
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,340
Then, the phantom ingredient is...

289
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,690
Not the Hungry-la Bird,
but Hungry-la Island?!

290
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,010
No wonder the Hungry-la Bird
was such an easy opponent!

291
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,610
This island itself is the
legendary ingredient...

292
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,280
A natural pudding à la mode!

293
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,540
Amazing!

294
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
What the heck is this?!

295
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,090
I wonder if Luffy and the others are okay...

296
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,890
Delicious!

297
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,760
This luxurious sweetness achieved
by condensing a multitude of fruits!

298
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,010
So this is the Multi-fruit!

299
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,480
It is indeed the Fruit Parlor of the Earth!

300
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,040
Hey, Toriko, you think this whole
mountain is made of pudding?!

301
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,480
You're right! It's delicious!

302
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,110
Hey! I was gonna eat that part!

303
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,840
What's the problem?! There's plenty!

304
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,620
Oh, and apparently the next
mountain is all ice cream!

305
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,860
What?! You should've said so sooner!

306
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,540
Wow! This castella is tasty, too!

307
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,690
Isn't that the mane of
one of those Caste Leos?

308
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,180
What?!

309
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,180
So after you ate all that, you're not
using any of it in your Full Course Meal?

310
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,140
Well, it's a big world.

311
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,560
I'm sure there's still lots
more delicious food out there.

312
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,560
You really are a big eater!

313
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,870
We're stocked up on food now.

314
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,710
We can set sail anytime.

315
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,540
Okay!

316
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,360
Well, we're gonna get going.

317
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,530
Right. Let's meet again somewhere.

318
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,200
Next time, I'll treat you to
my life's Full Course Meal.

319
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,230
Sure! I look forward to it, Toriko!

320
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,420
See ya, Luffy!

321
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,760
Bye!

322
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,540
So long!

323
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,480
A cheerful goodbye is a nice thing, but...

324
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,630
Who the heck are they?

325
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,560
Okay, now that we've got food supplies,
we're leaving these waters!

326
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,450
That's all pudding!

327
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,600
No, no! Pudding is a very
variable good that tastes like

328
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,480
sea urchin if you put soy sauce on it...

329
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,730
If you want sea urchin, get it from the sea!

330
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,030
