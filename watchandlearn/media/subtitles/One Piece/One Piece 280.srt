2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,530
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,320
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,330
attained everything this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,040
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,830
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,370
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,680
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,670
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,130
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,940
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,400
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,710
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,460
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,600
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,230
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,610
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,030
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,830
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,340
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,950
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,870
We are!

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,440
The drawbridge is coming down!

25
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,520
Looks like they pulled through. Good timing.

26
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,360
I-I'm trembling with anticipation!

27
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,870
Robin!

28
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,320
We're gonna rescue you for sure!

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,370
Lower that bridge already.

30
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,760
He looks evil.

31
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,510
I hear you're a bad guy.

32
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,180
Are you still here?

33
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,180
Being stuck out here for all to see...
Are you really strong at all?!

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,930
Mind your own business!

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,730
Seriously... just because I teamed
up with Luffy, I've come this far.

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,230
"The Ways of Men!
Zoro's Techniques, Usopp's Dream"

37
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,600
You're still as weak as ever, Zoro!

38
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,980
I promised her...

39
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,940
I can't afford to die in a place like this!

40
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
You again? You sure have lots of free time.

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,750
I'll untie you, so join my crew!

42
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,920
Say what?!

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,530
I'm looking for people to join my pirate crew.

44
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,140
Forget it! Me, stooping to a
criminal's level?! Screw that!

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,720
What's wrong with being a pirate?!

46
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,100
Pirates are despicable! As if I'd wanna be one!

47
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,110
Oh, come on! You're already
known as an evil bounty hunter!

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,560
People can say whatever they want,
but I ain't done anything I regret.

49
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,530
I will live through this
and accomplish what I want!

50
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,660
Yeah?

51
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,830
But I've decided you're gonna join me!

52
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,500
Quit deciding on your own!

53
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,960
I hear you use swords.

54
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,580
Yeah. But that stupid son took my stuff...

55
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,180
--I'll go get it back for you!
--What?!

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,890
So if you want your sword, join my crew!

57
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,130
You're really getting on my nerves!

58
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,010
Is he planning to bust into the base by himself?!

59
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,600
After him! Don't let him escape!

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,140
Captain! There's someone
in the crucifixion yard!

61
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,340
What?!

62
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,940
It's one traitor after the other...

63
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,030
Please escape, Zoro-san!

64
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,120
You'll be killed for doing that, you know!

65
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,830
I can't stand to watch
the Navy like this anymore.

66
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,460
I want to be an honorable marine!

67
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,880
Stop! I can't escape! I only got ten days until--

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
You're going to be executed tomorrow!

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
What?!

70
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,800
Helmeppo never once intended
to honor your agreement!

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,600
So Luffy-san got angry and punched him!

72
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,520
He did?

73
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,730
The Navy is after Luffy-san now.

74
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,020
I won't ask you to be a pirate.

75
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,030
But please, help Luffy-san!

76
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,580
Luffy-san is the only one who can save you.

77
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,930
And I think you're also the only
one who can save Luffy-san now.

78
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,000
End of the line!

79
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,930
This is some interesting
stuff you guys've pulled!

80
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,400
Were you two and that straw hat kid
plannin' a coup or something?!

81
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,650
I've always fought alone.

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,100
Unlike arrogant bastards like you
who use soldiers as cronies!

83
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,740
Roronoa Zoro...

84
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,580
Don't you dare underestimate me!

85
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,090
You may be strong, but before my
authority, you're as good as scum!

86
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,080
Aim!

87
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,460
I...

88
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,340
...can't afford to die here!

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,590
You're still as weak as ever, Zoro!

90
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,310
Gum-Gum...

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
...Rocket!

92
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Fire!

93
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,110
--What are you--?!
--Luffy-san!

94
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,080
Straw Hat?!

95
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,450
That doesn't work!

96
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,460
I told you I was strong!

97
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,630
W-Who the hell are you?!

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,440
I'm Monkey D. Luffy!

99
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,180
The man who's gonna be King of the Pirates!

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
The King of the Pirates?!

101
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,640
Do you even know what that means?!

102
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,810
King of the Pirates is King of the Pirates!

103
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,720
Are there any other meanings?

104
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,440
I was shocked, too! But Luffy-san
is serious! That's how he is!

105
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
He intends to become the King of the Pirates

106
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,040
and obtain this world's
ultimate treasure... the One Piece!

107
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,460
Here's your treasure!

108
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,300
Which is yours? I couldn't tell,
so I brought three of 'em.

109
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,890
All three are mine. I use the Three-Sword Style.

110
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,510
You'll take 'em, right?

111
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,930
If we fight together now, you'll be
a government-defying villain!

112
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,020
Would you prefer that, or being
killed by the Navy like this?

113
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,930
What are you, the devil's son?!

114
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,780
Well, whatever. I'll be your pirate,
if I'm just gonna die here instead!

115
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,200
Hurray! So you'll join my crew?!

116
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,280
Alright! Woo-hoo! This is great! Alright!

117
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,040
Okay! Now untie these stupid ropes already!

118
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,120
What... is he?

119
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,800
He flung the bullets back!

120
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,040
He's no ordinary human, that Straw Hat...

121
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,670
Must've eaten one of
those rumored Devil Fruits!

122
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,680
A Devil Fruit?!

123
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,380
Hurry! Hurry!

124
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,760
Damn! These knots are tight!

125
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,090
Hey! Quit wastin' time!

126
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,060
No matter who they are, everyone
who opposes me gets executed!

127
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
If guns won't work, then chop them to death!

128
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,360
Huh, that's weird! It got tighter instead!

129
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,650
Give me a damn sword!

130
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,910
Luffy-san!

131
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,910
Roronoa Zoro!

132
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,500
So cool!

133
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,930
Move and you're dead.

134
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,670
Too scary!

135
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,930
I'll be a pirate. I promise you that.

136
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,730
I'm officially a criminal,
now that I've fought the Navy.

137
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,830
But I'll tell you this right now.
I'm only going to fulfill my ambition!

138
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,610
Ambition?

139
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,440
To be the world's greatest swordsman!

140
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,490
If I wind up having to give that up,

141
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,580
you'd better accept responsibility
and apologize to me!

142
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,620
The world's greatest swordsman?
That sounds great!

143
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,090
The King of the Pirates would
need no less than that on his crew!

144
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,540
You sure talk big.

145
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,300
At this point, whether it's
as a criminal or whatever else,

146
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,710
I will spread my name throughout the world!

147
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,300
What're you standing around for?!
Slaughter them this instant!

148
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,240
Duck, Zoro!

149
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,340
Gum-Gum Whip!

150
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,820
Y-You did it! Incredible!

151
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,280
What the hell are you?

152
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,240
I ate the Gum-Gum Fruit.

153
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,990
Gum-Gum Fruit?

154
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,030
A rubber person!

155
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,500
So he does have Devil Fruit powers!

156
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,870
Captain! We don't stand a chance against them!

157
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,330
These guys are crazy!

158
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,370
We can't even handle Zoro by himself!

159
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,010
This is a direct order!

160
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,880
Everyone who spouted weakness just now

161
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,840
must now shoot themselves in the head!

162
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,890
I have no need for weakling soldiers!

163
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,150
These troops are mental!

164
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,020
Luffy-san!

165
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,610
Crush this navy!

166
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,370
Rankless, low-status bums have
no right whatsoever to defy me!

167
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,380
I am Navy Captain "Axe-Hand" Morgan!

168
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm Luffy! Nice to meetcha!

169
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,990
Die!

170
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,930
T-The captain!

171
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,550
R-Runt...

172
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,690
Die!

173
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,070
No thanks!

174
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,940
C-Captain Morgan is...

175
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,410
...being trounced completely...

176
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,250
And you call yourself a navy?!
You've destroyed Coby's dream!

177
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,930
Hold it, Straw Hat! Check this out!

178
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,590
I said hold it! Are you stupid?!

179
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,310
Pay attention! I have a hostage here!

180
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,150
Helmeppo-sama!

181
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,360
Hey.

182
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,230
If you value this guy's life, don't move!
One move and I'll shoot!

183
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,700
Luffy-san! I don't want to get in
your way! Even if it means dying!

184
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,470
Yeah, I know!

185
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,660
Give it up, stupid son!
Coby really is ready to die!

186
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,640
Don't move! I told you not to move! I-I'll shoot!

187
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,300
Behind you!

188
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,630
Gum-Gum...

189
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,100
I am Navy Captain "Axe-Hand" Morgan!

190
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,760
Dad! Kill him, quick!

191
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,470
...Pistol!

192
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,440
Nice!

193
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,370
Zoro.

194
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,750
My pleasure, Captain.

195
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,730
The drawbridge stopped coming down?!

196
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,490
How dare they get in our way?! Damn bastards!

197
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,070
Who's doing this?!

198
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,100
Do not worry, Robin-kun.

199
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,120
I'm just trembling with anticipation!

200
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,080
We will... rescue you for sure!

201
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,080
There's a whole bunch of bad guys, right?

202
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,550
"Scared" is written all over your face.

203
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,220
M-Me, scared?! I'm perfectly okay
with lots of bad guys or whatever!

204
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,760
Because I'm Captain Usopp,
brave warrior of the sea!

205
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,190
Dammit! Dammit! This isn't a show!

206
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,400
These are Klahadore's
pirates we're dealing with!

207
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,480
Of course I'm scared! What's wrong with that?!

208
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,360
I don't want your sympathy!
You guys can leave! Leave!

209
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,320
We ain't laughing! We're helping
'cause we think you're honorable!

210
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,370
As if we'd risk our lives because of sympathy!

211
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,640
Oh... You guys...!

212
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,050
Usopp!

213
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,250
D-Dammit...

214
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,020
I... can't... move...

215
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,770
Though, even if you did catch up with Jango,

216
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,560
you'd be no match for him anyway.

217
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,100
This way is probably safest for you!

218
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,990
Even if I am no match...

219
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,250
Even if I am no match for him...
I will protect them!

220
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,330
I'm captain of the Usopp Pirates...

221
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,420
...and a brave warrior of the sea!

222
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:53,380
I won't let you lay a finger on the village!

223
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,470
--What's with him?
--He's yellin' somethin'!

224
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,740
Check it out, he's cryin'!

225
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,480
What's so funny?!

226
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,350
Luffy!

227
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,170
Me and Usopp are gonna chase
that hypno-freak! That a problem?!

228
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,790
Nope! Hurry!

229
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,420
Looks like you're one step too late, Haramaki!

230
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,990
I wouldn't say so!

231
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,560
Yes! That branch was in the way!

232
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,060
What?!

233
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,890
Usopp-san...

234
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,980
Special Attack: Exploding Star!

235
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,730
So you are taking to the ocean, Usopp-san?

236
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,350
Yeah. I've decided to get going
before I start to change my mind.

237
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,750
Don't stop me, now.

238
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,310
I won't. I could just tell somehow.

239
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,540
That's kind of sad, too!

240
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,880
The next time I come to this village,

241
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,220
I'll tell you adventure stories that
seem even more lie-like than lies!

242
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,970
Okay! I look forward to it!

243
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,710
You guys take care, too!
Let's meet again sometime!

244
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,840
--How come?
--Huh? How come?

245
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,350
Man, you're antisocial...

246
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm gonna be a pirate too, so we'll
meet on the high seas eventually!

247
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,240
What're you talkin' about? Get on already.

248
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,610
--Eh?!
--We're friends now, aren't we?

249
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,210
I...

250
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,380
I get to be captain, right?!

251
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,070
Don't be dumb! I'm the captain!

252
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,240
Hey, pirates! What're you
guys wasting time for?!

253
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,710
Wasting time? But the
bridge is only halfway down.

254
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,550
Halfway is good enough!

255
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,620
We'll be there in four seconds.

256
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,020
Jump with all your might towards the falls!

257
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,250
Is that Granny? What does she mean?

258
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,920
I don't know. But she said
jump towards the falls.

259
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,050
The sound of the sea train?

260
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,640
Huh? What's the meaning of that smile?

261
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,690
Here we go!

262
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
I knew it!

263
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,080
Nooo!

264
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,540
"Straw Hat Theater"

265
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,910
"Part 2"

266
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,530
"A report on Luffy's eating habits
before Sanji joined the gang."

267
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,510
This is "On-Location Tsubaki," a crooked
reporter who'll help us on this report.

268
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,180
"His favorite words:

269
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,670
His favorite words are:
"I'm so happy that words fail me."

270
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,020
"His favorite words:
'I'm so happy that words fail me'"

271
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,140
Err... This is On-Location Tsubaki.

272
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,450
Luffy, you set sail all by yourself, right?

273
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,610
Tell everyone how an idiot like you survived.

274
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,240
Sure!

275
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,710
I took lots of meat and water that I got
in the village with me when I set sail.

276
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,750
But I ate them all right away.

277
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,540
I'm so dumbfounded that words fail me.

278
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,710
Well, after that I was starving
and thirsty. It was really tough.

279
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,310
But I was saved by eating mushrooms
and stuff that someone left in the boat.

280
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,840
Hey, the mushrooms just grew
because of the ample humidity.

281
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:08,730
But then, big fish would sometimes
jump out of the sea, trying to eat me.

282
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,310
So I beat them up and...

283
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,730
Ate them?! You could've died.

284
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,940
It sounds like you were living hand to mouth.

285
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,980
But it was okay! I had confidence in myself!

286
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,160
H-Hey, hey... That's so
powerful that words fail me.

287
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,880
Err... And then, that stupid
Zoro became a crew member.

288
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,390
I guess I can't expect much from you, either.

289
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,080
You both are idiots. How were
you able to make it this far?

290
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,640
I set sail before he did,
so I was more experienced.

291
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,840
I was used to sailing.

292
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,890
Our captain is like this, so I had
to be the one who got it together.

293
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,510
Big fish would sometimes jump out of the sea,
trying to eat us. So I beat them up and...

294
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,680
I've been caught in the chains of
disappointment and can't move.

295
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,720
In other words, you could've
starved to death then,

296
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,150
which could've led to the
end of your adventures, huh?

297
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,440
Yeah. But if we had died, that would mean
we weren't man enough to make it.

298
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,520
H-Hey, hey... That's so manly that words fail me.

299
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,230
Okay, then. Come on,
Nami the gangster woman.

300
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,870
Really, I was surprised by their lack
of planning or any sense of danger.

301
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,130
That's why I managed the food
after we set sail together...

302
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,660
...while being careful about properly preserving

303
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,880
cheese, bread, dried meat, etc. and water.

304
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,500
They might've died if it wasn't for me.

305
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,680
So...

306
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,430
...they owe me.

307
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,280
H-Hey, hey... That smile is so
scheming that words fail me.

308
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,470
Now, we have Usopp the scaredy-cat
who was next to join the gang.

309
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,270
The Straw Hats finally got a bigger ship

310
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,270
by obtaining the Going Merry when
you left your village, didn't you,

311
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,480
even though you're all idiots?

312
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,320
That's right. I want them to
appreciate me for that first.

313
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,620
It wasn't you who gave it to us.

314
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,870
He's right. It was Kaya.

315
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,080
That was because I was good
friends with Kaya, wasn't it?!

316
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,990
If you wanna fight, do it later.
Did something change in your life?

317
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,550
Oh, yeah! Usopp is good at fishing,
so we ate quite a bit of fish.

318
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,480
But the fish you catch,
like sauries and sardines, are small.

319
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,050
You dummy! I like seasonal fish
better than the meat of sea monsters!

320
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,600
We had a kitchen, so I
cooked for you guys, didn't I?

321
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,010
Usopp's got lots of seasonings for some reason.

322
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,750
To tell you the truth, Nami's homemade
food was quite good, but it wasn't free.

323
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,070
So we never asked her to cook again.

324
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,020
I'm an expensive woman.

325
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,560
There are devils everywhere in the world.

326
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,650
And now, we finally have a damn filthy
man who always says "damn, damn."

327
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,500
To be honest, I wanna cook just
for Nami-san. My hobby is Nami-san!

328
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,870
Since Sanji joined us,

329
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,060
meals have become something
we really look forward to.

330
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,510
If we catch things like birds or fish,
he'll turn them into really yummy food!

331
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,130
Since he's a pro, he considers
nutritional balance, too, so that's helpful!

332
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,350
--Mellorine! Mellorine! Love hurricane!
--I was finally able to focus
on my job as a navigator.

333
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,770
That's the only redeeming trait
you have, so you can do your best.

334
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,770
What'd you say, you bastard?!

335
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,480
Well then, at any rate,
why don't I try telling everyone

336
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,990
how the food you eat
during your journey tastes?

337
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,040
Words fail me...

338
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,790
What a useless reporter!

339
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,140
Robin... It must've been really hard.

340
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,590
But you're not alone anymore.

341
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,380
Just wait, Robin. You've got us.

342
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,470
So have faith in us... in Luffy!

343
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,470
He'll respond to your feelings without fail.

344
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

345
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,810
"A Bond of Friendship Woven
by Tears! Nami's World Map"

346
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
