2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,620
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,480
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,--

11
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,690
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

12
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,110
They landed on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen.

13
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,820
After forming an alliance with Trafalgar Law,

14
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,660
Luffy finally encountered Caesar Clown

15
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,210
but was beaten by his mysterious power.

16
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,880
Meanwhile, Law, too, got taken down by
the Navy G-5 base commander - Vergo.

17
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,130
So what I'm going to do is give Smiley,

18
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,890
the weapon from four
years ago, a big "boost."

19
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,820
It will add a new effect to the poison gas

20
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,530
and the weapon of mass destruction
will reach completion.

21
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,860
The new weapon that will make
its debut today is called...

22
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,780
...Shinokuni!

23
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,940
Hey, guys! I see a ball!

24
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,630
Let's go!

25
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,330
Smiley! I missed you!

26
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,840
It's been three years!

27
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,180
Oh yes, Smiley?

28
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,110
This brings back memories!

29
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,730
I have something good for you!

30
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,070
That's a big candy!

31
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,530
What is that?

32
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,150
Good boy, Smiley.

33
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,790
Nobody can stop him now!

34
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,060
"The Deadliest Weapon of Mass
Destruction in History! Shinokuni!"

35
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,320
--What is that creature?!
--Doesn't it look like those creepy jellies?!

36
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,530
What is going on?!

37
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,880
He ate it!

38
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,660
He ate the candy!

39
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,300
You ate it!

40
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,280
Smiley!

41
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,130
Be reborn!

42
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,230
What can he be reborn as?

43
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,740
The perfect weapon of mass destruction.

44
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,030
That's such a big frog!

45
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,830
Now...

46
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,300
...be reborn!

47
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,490
Smiley!

48
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,910
Look out! Something's going on!

49
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,660
What is "something"?!

50
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,290
How do I know?! But I'm
sure it's something bad!

51
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,750
Just do as the Master
says and run to the lab!

52
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,420
Damn! I can't believe the
sled broke! Why now?!

53
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,300
Master!

54
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,090
He's acting strange since he ate the candy!

55
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,970
I wonder if the candy was that good!

56
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,870
Let's just run!

57
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,650
Even soldiers from this island
are running desperately!

58
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,310
I have a bad feeling about this!

59
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,020
Couldn't agree more!

60
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,900
Good work, Smiley!

61
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,990
See you again!

62
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
Now, come to life!

63
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,460
The weapon of mass destruction - Shinokuni!

64
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,590
What is that?!

65
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,490
Change the face of the island completely!

66
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,900
Hey, don't tell me...

67
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,810
Run!

68
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,350
Wait for me!

69
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,180
Oh! Hey, wait!

70
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,230
Oh, my legs!

71
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,900
What happened?!

72
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,950
Help me...

73
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,710
--What's happening?!
--I don't know! Just run!

74
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,590
My body...

75
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,760
I can't move it!

76
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,380
Run! Just run!

77
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,980
Master!!

78
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,820
Yes! It worked!

79
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,380
Nobody can get away this time!

80
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,070
This is it!

81
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,220
The problem with the last experiment
was there were survivors.

82
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,320
They could still move even after being
poisoned so they were able to escape.

83
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,830
Which means...

84
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,090
...I should've petrified them!

85
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,420
The gas clings to people's bodies like ash.

86
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,510
It enters through their skin and
paralyzes their whole body at once!

87
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,320
Now, the perfect weapon of
mass destruction, Shinokuni!

88
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,690
Give us a good glimpse of hell!

89
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,960
What the hell is going on?!

90
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,040
People are...

91
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,460
Help me...

92
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,140
...solidifying!

93
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,910
Master!

94
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,700
Hey, what is that?

95
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,070
This is something out of a horror movie!

96
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,080
Those who just died looked
like Caesar's men...

97
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,580
What was that purple smoke?

98
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,140
By the way, where are they filming this?

99
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,740
If you don't know yet, you
better not turn around!

100
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,260
Don't tell me that was...

101
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,840
No! That was happening on this island?!

102
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,860
Master!

103
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,700
Oh no! We have to run! Or
we'll end up like them...

104
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,740
It's impossible!

105
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,580
There's nowhere to run on
the island from such gas!

106
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,790
Oh, I see! That's why
they sealed off the lab!

107
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,530
They didn't want the gas to enter!

108
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,250
Open up, Caesar!

109
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,480
Damn! I don't wanna die here!

110
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,610
Damn! Damn! This is not joke! Open up!

111
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,500
Hey! I found him!

112
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,420
Brownbeard, you okay?!

113
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,020
He's still breathing but...

114
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,610
He's badly wounded...

115
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,430
We're okay thanks to you...

116
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,760
Caesar!

117
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,680
Gastanet!

118
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,440
Brownbeard...

119
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,770
Anyway, let's pull him out from
under this iron pipe, Sanji!

120
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,490
I am Nami!

121
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,560
Hey! Don't be so disappointed again!

122
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,490
Well, it's just...

123
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,210
It's gonna be pretty heavy physical work!

124
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,050
We have no choice!

125
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,210
Uh-huh!

126
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,300
Damn! It won't budge an inch!

127
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,390
Come on!

128
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,270
We'll pull you out soon!
Hang in there, Brownbeard!

129
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,820
He's right! You can do it!

130
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,490
You two...

131
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,420
Don't die, Brownbeard!

132
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,710
I'm not gonna...

133
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,470
…kick the bucket yet!

134
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,630
That asshole - Caesar is...

135
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,770
...unforgivable!

136
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,900
Brownbeard...

137
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,320
But I have to save my crew first!

138
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,400
Otherwise, I can't die in peace!

139
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,070
Hey, you...

140
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,580
I gotta get to the lab where my
crew are as soon as possible!

141
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,290
But you're hurt all over...

142
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,370
So we all wanna go to the same place!

143
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,260
We have to save those
kids from that jerk, too!

144
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,300
So why don't you join forces with
us and beat that gas bastard...

145
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,770
What's that smoke?

146
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,930
Huh? What's that? It's
a huge amount of smoke!

147
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,560
That doesn't look like just smoke to me.

148
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,730
It could be poison gas.

149
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,740
What? Poison gas?!

150
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,170
It's coming this way!

151
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,330
Hey hey hey! What should do?!

152
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,730
Don't ask me!

153
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,080
Do something about it!

154
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,230
Oh no no! What do you want
me to do about that smoke?!

155
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,990
--Let's just go to the...
--You two, get on my back!

156
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

157
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,160
R...

158
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,140
Run!!

159
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,220
It's gonna reach us soon!

160
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,670
Guys, run at full speed!

161
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,980
If anybody gets caught,
we'll have to leave you!

162
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,160
Zoro-san, it's gonna catch
us if we don't do something!

163
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,800
We're dead! It's catching up to us!

164
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,470
Run faster than the wind!

165
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,480
Did we outrun it even a little bit?!

166
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,900
Don't turn around! Just focus
on running at full speed!

167
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,570
We can't run like this for very long!

168
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,290
I see a mysterious animal up ahead!

169
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,170
What is that?!

170
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,500
That's...

171
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,220
--A dragon!
--A dragon?!

172
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,510
A dragon?!

173
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,370
No way! A dragon is a mythical creature!

174
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,970
They exist on this island!

175
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,310
But that one is way smaller
than the one I saw!

176
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,640
Oh yeah! If we can catch
it, we can fly on it!

177
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,290
That's a great idea!

178
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,380
Alright! I can't run like this any longer!

179
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,900
Let's catch it!

180
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,820
Wait, dragon!

181
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,160
Oh, that's Zoro and the others!

182
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,450
They're being chased by the smoke!

183
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,370
Dragon!--

184
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,480
What are they doing there?

185
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,230
I mean, why are they running like that?

186
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,860
Samurai-san got his whole body back.

187
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,720
Oh yeah! He's not gonna let
me have those legs, then.

188
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,350
Hey, Robin! That's not important now!

189
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,050
Hey, guys! That smoke is
deadly! You have to run...

190
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,300
Oh no... I can't even raise my voice.

191
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,150
Damn Sea Prism Stone!

192
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,320
Are they your friends, "Straw Hat Luffy"?

193
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,050
That's just what I'd expect from
your friends - they're tough!

194
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,080
But soon they're going to be running
out of breath and poisoned by the gas.

195
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,970
And eventually, there'll be only an
uninhabitable "Land of Death (Shinokuni)"!

196
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:11,810
No one outside of this
laboratory will survive.

197
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,690
Neither will any of you!

198
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,030
What's happening?!

199
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,660
Now prove it to the world!

200
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,130
Before this weapon of mass
destruction - Shinokuni,

201
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,740
a pirate with a 400 million berry bounty,

202
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,540
a Navy vice admiral,

203
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,000
and even a Warlord...

204
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,770
...are totally helpless...

205
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,550
...against the tide of death!

206
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,470
Oh no! Oh no!

207
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,100
He's gonna do something
to Luffy and the others!

208
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,750
What should I do?!

209
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,670
I want to help but I'd be easily
caught with these wounds!

210
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,950
And then the formula for
the drug that I found

211
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,760
and the sedatives I got will be wasted!

212
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,040
Oh no! What should I do?!

213
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,130
Ouch! Oh!

214
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,880
Boy! That was close!

215
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,550
Huh? A paper?

216
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,320
"Don't do anything"?

217
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,510
Who wrote this?!

218
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,790
What's that?! A cage?!

219
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,460
Could it be...

220
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,100
--Smo-yan!
--Tashigi-chan!

221
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,300
What a relief! They're fine!

222
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,510
Oh no!

223
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,660
--But they're still held captive!
--Damn! So we're all gonna die!

224
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,540
Smo-yan! Tashigi-chan!

225
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,660
Everybody!

226
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,430
By the way,

227
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,250
that laboratory is really well-built!

228
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,570
Yes, it is.

229
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,070
You can easily carry big
equipment with this thing.

230
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,590
H-How can you two be so relaxed?!

231
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,990
Hmmm... Okay, what should we do?

232
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,420
It was unexpected to see Vergo
here but Straw Hat-ya...

233
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,070
We can't miss a beat here.

234
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,300
The plan is still on.

235
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,690
Don't mess it up this time.

236
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,370
Let's fight back.

237
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,350
Okay!

238
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,300
As it garners attention all across the New World...

239
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,180
...the Straw Hats finally come face to face with Shinokuni.

240
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,760
Just when the crew's annihilation is all but guaranteed...

241
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,770
Law's life-or-death plan is set in motion!

242
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

243
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,230
"Launching the Counter Attack!
Luffy and Law's Great Escape!"

244
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,830
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
