Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,550
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,460
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,570
the future that I'm
aiming at hasn't changed

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

74
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,570
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,720
The Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,880
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

79
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,550
and landed on Punk Hazard;

80
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,650
an island with two parts, one burning, the other frozen.

81
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,150
They learned about the ruler
of the island and the

82
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,950
puppet master of Shinokuni
- Caesar Clown's motive

83
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,170
and along with their pirate
ally - the Warlord - Law,

84
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,640
were drawn into a climactic battle

85
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,200
which ended with Caesar's
defeat and capture.

86
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,410
Pirate brothers and sisters!

87
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,350
Thank you for helping us!

88
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,760
When we grow up, we will become...

89
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,660
...Pirates!

90
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,080
Don't!

91
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,310
Let's sail out!

92
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,610
Let's negotiate.

93
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,370
Your most important business partner is
one of the Four Emperors.

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,180
The big-time pirate - Kaido,
the King of the Beasts.

95
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,180
What would happen if he finds out
you can't produce SMILE anymore?

96
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,700
He'll destroy you.

97
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,980
What do you want in exchange for Caesar?

98
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,630
Name your price.

99
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,500
Resign from the Seven Warlords.

100
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,350
Damn squirt!

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,850
"The G-5 Wiped Out!
Doflamingo's Sudden Attack!"

102
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,530
How were you doing, Sunny?

103
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,370
I can't see the island anymore.

104
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,430
The fire, the ice, and the deadly gas.

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,500
The centaurs, the G-5, and the Warlord.

106
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,140
It was like hell.

107
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,560
Well, we're in the New World.

108
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,190
I'm sure it's not gonna get any easier.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,170
Ow, ow, ow... Easy!

110
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,110
Be quiet!

111
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,280
To be honest, I wanna kick your ass!

112
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,530
Ouch!

113
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,260
But I'm a doctor.

114
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,030
So I won't!

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,650
Please don't hurt me!

116
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,200
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow!

117
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,940
No, Brook! It's not a "little lamb"!

118
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,210
It's the Mini-Merry!

119
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,840
MINI-MERRY

120
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,330
I see.

121
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,830
You're the eighth person to ask me that.

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,660
Like I told the rest,

123
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,600
after I broke out the cage
parting ways with Luffy and the others...

124
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,730
There you are, Sunny!

125
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,030
So they hid you here, huh?

126
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,720
Let's go, Sunny!

127
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,160
I got out to the sea through
a channel in the lab

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,890
and retrieved the Mini-Merry...

129
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,610
...which had been docked
at the entrance to the island.

130
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,830
And then, in order to join you guys,

131
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,630
I used the General Franky
which is impervious to toxic gas

132
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,610
and went back to the lab.

133
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,070
Super!

134
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,250
I see, I see.

135
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,660
So that little lamb
was okay. That's good!

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,490
Can we have a cup of tea?

137
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,470
Sure.

138
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,570
Here you go.

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,740
It was very delicious!

140
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,390
I'm glad that you liked it.

141
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,680
By the way, why are
you two on this ship?

142
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,850
Oh yeah, I haven't thought about that

143
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,520
but the kids had gone with the Navy.

144
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,640
We're in the midst of
our important trip.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,790
So we didn't want to get

146
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,990
involved with the Navy
and waste our time.

147
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,430
You can drop us off on
some island with a harbor.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,620
Until then, please let us stay on board.

149
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,500
Please!

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,420
Okay, no problem!

151
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,350
Yeah!

152
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,340
You can pay us later.

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,420
Are you gonna charge us?!

154
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,380
Nami, where are we going next?

155
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,400
Hold on.

156
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,850
The next destination is already set.

157
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,830
It's Dressrosa.

158
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,290
The gas didn't work at all?!

159
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,450
This protective suit is made by Vegapunk
and in fact...

160
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,430
...it's way beyond Caesar's ability.

161
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,120
Caesar knew that, so that's why he said

162
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,240
that to my colleagues who
were his test subjects.

163
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,460
You all, just run!

164
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,750
The protective suit won't help!

165
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,250
Take it off and run to the lab now!

166
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,520
What? O-Okay!

167
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,820
Master!

168
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,180
And that's how they all got petrified.

169
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,000
--Let's get going!
--Yeah!

170
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,540
Those who got petrified are still alive!

171
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,420
If Caesar is telling the truth,

172
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,630
they're just in a state of apparent death
paralyzed in the shell.

173
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,300
Yeah, but the poison will damage

174
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,240
their body and kill
them in twelve hours!

175
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,610
We have to find them
and break the shell before that!

176
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,990
Let's save them all at any cost!

177
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,930
Yeah!

178
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,170
Thank you...

179
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,320
...for allowing us to enter the island.

180
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,990
I'll never forget your name.

181
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,780
I can save my people's lives!

182
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,300
I promise I'll come
back to turn myself in!

183
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,310
This is the only exit anyway.

184
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,200
Just go!

185
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,400
Okay!

186
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,660
What should we do with these?

187
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,880
Are they pirates?

188
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,830
I don't know. It's just creepy.

189
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,200
Something's flying toward us.

190
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,300
What?!

191
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,150
Isn't that somebody's head?!

192
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,140
Huh? Don't be ridiculous!

193
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,830
Y-You were right!

194
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,680
Heads are...

195
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,210
...Flying toward us!

196
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,750
What?!

197
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,060
That guy is...

198
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,010
N-No way!

199
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,050
Y-You're...

200
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,690
D-Doflamingo!

201
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,010
The Warlord?!

202
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,960
W-Why is he here?!

203
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,990
Conqueror's Haki!

204
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,820
Why did you do that?!

205
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
They're not here.

206
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,670
The ship is gone.

207
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,440
You're a Warlord!
Why are you attacking the Navy?!

208
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,310
I know some pirates were
here a little while ago.

209
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,620
Where did they go?

210
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,350
How dare you do that to our colleagues!

211
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,750
Don't do it!

212
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,050
I can't move my fingers.

213
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,200
What happened?!

214
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,620
Wh-What are you doing?!

215
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,800
W-What about you?!

216
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,540
No, I can't... control my body!

217
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,700
Law is different

218
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,110
but Straw Hat is just an ordinary pirate.

219
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,350
Don't!

220
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,890
Where did they go, you bastards?!

221
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,530
Wh-What are you gonna do to me?!

222
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,290
Answer my question.

223
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,370
Ouch!

224
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,730
Which direction did those shitheads go?!

225
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,290
I don't know what you're talking about!

226
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,300
Then go to hell.

227
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,070
Stop messing with my soldiers!

228
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,270
S-Smo-yan...

229
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,410
Smoker.

230
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,810
Tell me where those shitheads went.

231
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,500
I'm thinking about going to Green Bit.

232
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,420
Well, I don't know,

233
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,690
"Joker."

234
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,280
We could've caught them
but we let them get away.

235
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,070
I don't know what to say
to our base commander - Vergo.

236
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,480
He died, didn't he?!

237
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,000
I think you know too much.

238
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,490
Smoker!

239
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,600
Take this!

240
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,510
It's no use!

241
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,860
It's no good!

242
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,540
He keeps suffering that guy's strange attacks!

243
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,680
He has to defend himself!

244
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,120
Why doesn't he use his jitte
with the Sea Prism Stone tip?!

245
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,120
It'll cancel out Devil Fruit powers!

246
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,090
Demon Bamboo!

247
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,200
You're no match for me.

248
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,650
Stop resisting and just
accept your death.

249
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,420
--Smo-yan!
--We'll fight, too!

250
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,550
Do you guys wanna die first?

251
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,630
Stay away!

252
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,610
Smo-yan!

253
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,610
Vice Admiral Smo!!

254
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,660
Dressrosa?!

255
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,370
Yes, there is something
we have to do there.

256
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,270
D-Dressrosa?!

257
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,440
What? Do you know the place?

258
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,330
Th-That's exactly where we...
I mean, I want to go!

259
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,580
You need to go there, too?!

260
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,050
Uh-huh, I think so!

261
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,520
You have no idea what's
going on, do you?

262
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,420
Nope!

263
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,620
The current is shifting?!

264
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,990
What's going on here?!

265
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,400
A slope?!

266
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,300
Yee-ha!

267
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,940
It's fast! The ship's going fast!

268
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,770
Look out for rock reefs!

269
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,230
What's going on around here?!

270
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,290
It's a sea slope. It's not uncommon.

271
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,290
It is uncommon!

272
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,780
We don't have to go against the current.

273
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,840
The needle in the middle

274
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,950
on your Log Pose must be
pointing toward Dressrosa.

275
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,760
But don't try to go straight.
Take a detour.

276
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,990
Why?

277
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,780
Because it'll work out better for us.

278
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,480
He's being such a know-it-all smart-ass.

279
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,440
Come to think of it,

280
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,350
you were talking on the Transponder Snail earlier.

281
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,920
Who were you talking to?

282
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,470
That was Doflamingo.

283
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,720
Doflamingo?! The Warlord?!

284
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,360
I've heard he's the most evil one!

285
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,010
The plan is already in action.

286
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,780
What plan?

287
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,950
Yeah, tell us about the plan!
Get together, everybody!

288
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,720
We formed an alliance
to kill one of the Four Emperors?!

289
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,060
The Four Emperors, huh?
It's great!

290
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
No, it's not!

291
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,530
That's a super big deal!

292
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,130
Wait, wait! Let's calm down, everybody!

293
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,170
Luffy, tell them about the alliance.

294
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,750
Okay! We and Tra-guy's pirate group
formed an alliance!

295
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,080
Let's be nice to each other!

296
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,440
Does anybody wanna oppose this?!

297
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,660
--I do!
--I do!

298
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,310
I do!

299
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,150
Does it make any difference?

300
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,430
Luffy's mind is already set, isn't it?

301
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,580
Thank you.

302
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,240
But I have to warn you.

303
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,440
There may be a slight difference between

304
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,480
how you define "alliance" and how Luffy defines it.

305
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,550
Be careful.

306
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,460
That's why Luffy kept saying "kidnap"

307
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,400
which was so out of character for him.

308
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,290
If he had just come to me
with that strange sheep

309
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,340
and ask me to cook it, I
wouldn't know what to do.

310
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,470
You bastards.
You're not gonna get away with this.

311
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,170
Extraordinarily big names
will hunt you down!

312
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,420
Idiots!

313
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,820
Realize how stupid you are! Go to hell!

314
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,330
Hey, Sanji! I was in the
middle of his treatment!

315
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,820
Wait until I finish it.

316
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,470
Really?!

317
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,840
I asked you guys to kidnap
Caesar at Punk Hazard.

318
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,220
Meanwhile, I destroyed
the machine which was

319
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,910
manufacturing a substance called SAD.

320
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,280
The great pirates in the New World
often have their own territory.

321
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,990
They lead countless numbers of people
and reign like a syndicate.

322
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,860
It's nothing like what
you've seen before.

323
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,340
One pirate group is never strong enough
even to see their captain's face.

324
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,770
But since it's an underground community,

325
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,580
they have to do their businesses secretly
to avoid the Navy.

326
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:48,150
And Doflamingo is the most trusted
and powerful man among them.

327
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,830
His underground alias is Joker.

328
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:57,460
And Joker's most important
business partner now is...

329
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,000
...one of the Four Emperor -
Kaido, the King of the Beasts.

330
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,670
Our target.

331
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,680
--Stop!
--Smo-yan's gonna die!

332
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,480
If you kill him,

333
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,250
who would lead misfits like us!?

334
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,150
Don't worry.

335
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,380
There is no way to find
out who knows what.

336
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,990
That's why, Law, Straw
Hat, and you soldiers,

337
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,010
I'm gonna kill you all!

338
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,280
No!

339
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,410
Whoa-whoa.

340
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,220
Excuse me, young man.

341
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Could you step aside?

342
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,900
What?!

343
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,640
He is my...

344
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,120
...friend.
