The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Freedom is our only compass,
We are best friends

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,130

Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,280
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,380
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,870
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,920
When Luffy found out that the prize for a
fighting event was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,140
he decided to enter and face
the fierce competition!

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,810
Please don't die, Soldier-san!

79
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,630
I won't...

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,830
...give up, either!

81
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,220
"The Last - and Bloodiest - Block!
Block D Battle Begins!"

82
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,830
Drop dead, Rebecca!

83
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,250
You foul-blooded wench!

84
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,600
Go to hell, Rebecca!

85
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,900
Today's your execution day!

86
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,910
The shame of Dressrosa!

87
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,150
Set her on fire!

88
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,370
That'll make her pyromaniac
grandfather happy!

89
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,850
The battle royal in the
Corrida Colosseum - Block D!

90
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:16,180
As the "Phantom Princess" Rebecca enters,
the crowd is really heating up!

91
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,370
Even if she's the former king's granddaughter,
it had nothing to do with her!

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,680
Whatever her grandfather did!

93
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
Yeah, you're right.

94
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,080
I wouldn't expect that to come from you.

95
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,810
Even if her grandfather is the former king
who the whole country despises,

96
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,790
Rebecca is our hope!

97
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,000
Your hope?

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,300
Yes, Rebecca and all of
us have been fighting

99
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,040
desperately to claw our way
up from this dark abyss…

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,350
...with no way out.

101
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,660
We were not strong enough
so we ended up like this

102
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,180
but Rebecca isn't hurt.

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,300
I mean, hurt or not,
only Rebecca can keep our hope alive.

104
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,240
If she can win this thing
and get the Flare-Flare Fruit,

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,060
things may get a little better here.

106
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,510
Go to hell!

107
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,210
You're hated by the whole
country, Rebecca-chan!

108
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,480
Despite that pretty face,

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,540
people think you're a bigger villain
than Bartolomeo from Block B!

110
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,220
That's right!

111
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,760
--Screw you, Rebecca!
--The corrupted King Riku's family!

112
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,780
That's enough!

113
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,720
Oh! The man that's coming into the ring is...

114
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,150
What an ill-behaved crowd! I can't stand it!

115
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,290
Shame on you!

116
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:35,050
Here comes the captain of the Beautiful Pirates -
Cavendish of the White Horse!

117
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,590
CAVENDISH OF THE WHITE HORSE

118
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,880
Cavendish-sama!

119
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,660
Oh, how beautiful!

120
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,320
Get ahold of yourself!

121
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,240
Some women in the audience are collapsing!

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,230
He still has the look that everybody
was talking about three years ago!

123
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,200
Cavendish-sama!
Kick that little tramp's ass!

124
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,820
Teach Rebecca a lesson!

125
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,870
Shut up, you bastards!

126
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,260
I don't know why you hate her so much,

127
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,580
but she's a young girl who stands in the ring,
putting her life on the line!

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,450
You guys are not risking your lives
so you have no right to jeer at her!

129
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,700
If you really want to kill her,

130
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,990
take a weapon and come
down to the ring yourself!

131
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,130
The voices of people who have no guts
are nothing but irritating noise!

132
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,850
I have my reasons for entering this event,
but even so I can't stomach it!

133
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,190
The lives and deaths of
warriors are not a show!

134
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,160
Thank you, Farul.

135
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,740
What are the horse and the bullhorn for?

136
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh, Cabbage spoke up and
said the right thing.

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,060
I'm impressed.

138
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,410
I still don't like him though.

139
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,970
--Cavendish-sama!
--What a great man!

140
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,460
I don't care about Rebecca anymore!

141
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm gonna support you!

142
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,780
Cavendish!

143
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,540
I can't believe it! He's so charismatic!

144
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,760
He turned the tumultuous booing
to a shower of applause!

145
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,240
Hey, I understand how you feel.
This is not what you wanted, right?

146
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I think it bothers you
how easily they change their mind

147
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,060
but people are often like that.
They don't listen to you...

148
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,750
They love me so much! I'm so happy!

149
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,630
--You like it?!
--It's been three years...

150
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,040
Excuse me.

151
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,710
Thank you for standing up for me earlier.

152
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,880
Don't mention it.
It's true that it aggravated me.

153
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,200
It must be hard for you.

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,950
But forget it.
We have to fight each other.

155
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,240
Right.

156
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,250
By the way, there must be one
or two news reporters here.

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,620
What should I do
if this gets in the newspaper?

158
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,790
After the match, they'd interview me and go,
"Hey there, big star!"

159
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,860
And I'd go, "What did you call me?"

160
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,160
Maybe!

161
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,190
While all of that was going on,
we have all the competitors in the ring!

162
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,530
With one abstention,
there are 137 contenders for Block D!

163
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:30,270
A tough warriors' battle royal!
Now, let's start...

164
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,470
...the match!

165
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,460
Alright!

166
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,710
Cavendish-sama!

167
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,020
Decapitate somebody, Suleiman!

168
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,000
Kick their asses, Orlumbus!

169
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,130
Go to hell, Rebecca!

170
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,190
Watch me, Soldier-san!

171
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,470
GREEN BIT

172
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,960
I have no interest in your past but...

173
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,970
...only people who can use the World
Government just to deceive us are...

174
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,040
...the Celestial Dragons!

175
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,410
So what?

176
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,680
You can't buy any more time, Law.

177
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,890
You said "It's more complicated" earlier.
What did you mean by that?

178
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,630
If you wanna chat with me,
hand Caesar over first.

179
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,860
And his heart.

180
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,900
Caesar is...

181
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,500
I mean, those SMILEs are
that important to you?!

182
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,910
I guess they are.

183
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,390
Without the SMILEs, Kaido's gonna
kill you and it's all over for you.

184
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,860
Room!

185
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,910
Shambles!

186
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,280
You damn pip-squeak!

187
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,150
Fujitora?

188
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,510
Excuse me.

189
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,440
Why did you help him?

190
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,100
I have to stop you right there,
Heavenly Demon.

191
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,490
I'm here to...

192
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,430
...arrest him, not to kill him.

193
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,700
Alright.

194
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,080
But I need Caesar's heart back, Law.

195
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,210
By the way, you seem quite curious about
that "complication" that I mentioned.

196
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,360
Do you wanna hear about it?

197
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,650
DRESSROSA - THE FLOWER FIELD

198
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,750
AN ANTI-DOFLAMINGO COALITION -
"THE KING RIKU ARMY" HEADQUARTERS

199
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,030
Hey!

200
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,740
We brought the legendary heroes -
Usoland and Robiland!

201
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,480
Usopp! Robin!

202
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,210
Yellow Cub and Pink Bee Squad!

203
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,560
Arrived from Green Bit!

204
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,660
Thank you, Leo!

205
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,470
The time has come, Commander!

206
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,890
This battle is to restore
the honor of King Riku

207
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,330
who was dethroned in
disappointment ten years ago

208
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,580
and to take back our freedom!

209
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,650
That day, Doflamingo came to this country
and took away everything with violence!

210
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,790
I'll never forget that!

211
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,400
We spent one whole year...

212
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,090
...preparing our plan!

213
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,510
Even though they're the Warlord's pirate group,
we have a chance to win!

214
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,760
I should listen to their plan carefully
and look for the best timing to get away!

215
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,820
DRESSROSA - ACACIA

216
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,060
Zoroland, we're gonna turn left soon.

217
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,280
Left is the side that you
don't have your swords.

218
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,230
--You don't even trust me with "right" and "left"?
--Not at all!

219
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,690
The one who's attacking your ship is...

220
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,180
...one of the executives of the Don Quixote Family -
Giolla!

221
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,490
She can disarm her opponent
in an artistic way!

222
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,860
She's quite strong!

223
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,450
You know that much?!

224
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,130
I memorized the names and
faces and abilities of those

225
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,130
at the executive rank and
up as much as I could!

226
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,030
Especially those three top executives...

227
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,130
...who destroyed the entire Dressrosa army
ten years ago.

228
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,490
Trébol!

229
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,850
Diamante!

230
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,240
Pica! I'll never forget those three faces!

231
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,730
Ten years ago? How old are you?

232
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,250
I'm 27!

233
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,400
Y-You're 27?!

234
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,520
He's...

235
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,940
This way!

236
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,260
Zoro-dono! Zoro-dono!

237
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,490
We're here! Hey!

238
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,800
Don't shout, you fool!

239
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,120
Who are they?!

240
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,500
They're fooling around with each other.

241
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,100
Spiral-eyebrows-land and Topknot-land.

242
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,140
What?! Are you gonna go save Nami-san?!

243
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,870
So she was in trouble!
That's why she didn't pick up the Snail!

244
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,870
Okay, I'm coming with you!

245
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,670
Wait, Sanji-dono!

246
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,660
.We're here to tell
Luffy-dono what's going on!

247
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,790
Black Foot!

248
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,760
My sweet Violet-chan!

249
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,480
I wish that dumb passion
would kill you already.

250
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,920
My colleague, Giolla, hijacked your ship!

251
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,090
What?

252
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,040
And they're on their way to Green Bit!

253
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,780
Alright!

254
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,850
Who's going to win the battle royal for Block D?!

255
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,570
I can't get eliminated here!

256
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,670
No matter what it takes, I'll win this

257
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,760
and get the Flare-Flare Fruit

258
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,930
so I can take down Doflamingo!

259
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,650
Let's start with Rebecca!

260
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,330
Good idea!

261
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,760
And I will protect Soldier-san this time!

262
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,850
Everybody hates you, Rebecca-chan!

263
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,490
If I defeat you, I'm gonna
become the hero of the country!

264
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,700
It's not fair!

265
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
Those five men are going for Rebecca at once!

266
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,760
You're right. But it's always like that
when Rebecca enters a competition.

267
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,440
Most of the time, Rebecca is the only woman
competing among tough guys!

268
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,380
In addition, everybody in the Colosseum
wants to see Rebecca beaten!

269
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,790
So it's only natural that
they're going for Rebecca first!

270
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,610
Go get them, Rebecca! Don't lose!

271
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,230
Go go, Rebecca!

272
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,400
Let's have fun, Rebecca-chan!

273
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,440
You do realize you can attack, too, right?

274
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,480
You think you're better than me?!

275
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,060
What?!

276
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,040
--Screw you!
--Dammit!

277
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,080
--You bitch!
--Go to hell!

278
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,660
Damn!

279
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,950
You're such a coward, Rebecca!

280
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,890
Show us blood!

281
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,370
Kill each other!

282
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,310
Let me teach you how to fight.

283
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,510
My mother said I shouldn't hurt anyone!

284
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,940
You...

285
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,890
All you can do is deflect attacks?!

286
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,800
Take this!

287
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm gonna teach you how to not get hurt!

288
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,400
Drop dead!

289
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,610
What?!

290
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,260
Stand up, Rebecca!

291
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,800
You have to become stronger!

292
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,700
You bitch! Stop moving around!

293
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,090
Screw you!

294
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,170
Way to go, Rebecca!

295
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,030
Stay at it!

296
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,970
I won't give up!
