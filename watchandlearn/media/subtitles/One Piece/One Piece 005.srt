2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,810
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,760
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,660
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,620
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,630
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,820
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,540
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,840
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,400
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,200
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,280
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,500
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,710
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,210
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,370
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,320
Get back here!

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,440
Give that chart back,
you damn woman thief!

26
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,700
W-What?!

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,250
A person fell from the sky!

28
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,540
Now I'm safe!

29
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,550
That was a pretty neat experience I had!

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,140
"A Terrifying, Mysterious Power!
Captain Buggy, the Clown Pirate!"

31
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
I'm starving...

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,990
B-Boss!
You came to save me!

33
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,480
Wha--?

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,690
Who're you?

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,920
Sorry, but they're all yours now!

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,860
Hey! The girl got away!

37
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,580
That's okay!
Her boss is still here!

38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,500
Ah! Tryin' to cover
for your crony, huh?!

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,960
Say, is there any place to eat around here?

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,920
Quit screwin' around, kid!

41
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,890
Don't touch my treasure!

42
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,640
--Bastard!
--Bastard!

43
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,770
Wonder if they killed that guy...

44
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,100
Gum-Gum Pistol!

45
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,560
Wow!

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,240
You're really strong!

47
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,200
You beat people with sabers barehanded!

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,120
Hey! You're that... who?

49
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,260
I'm a thief who steals from pirates!

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,300
The name's Nami!
Hey, wanna team up with me?!

51
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,720
No. I don't feel like
teaming up with you.

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,500
H-Hold on!

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,220
Wait, I said!

54
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,180
Oh. I just remembered!

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,030
I'm starving...

56
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,320
Shall I treat you to some food?

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,740
Really?!

58
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,150
Y-Yeah...

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,590
They still haven't caught the thief?!

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,950
T-They should be pursuing her
as we speak, Captain Buggy! Yes!

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,750
How did the map get stolen
so easily in the first place?! Huh?!

62
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,240
Just when we're about to enter
the Grand Line and go on a rampage!

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,970
A-Actually, the shack was unlocked,
so it was easy to take for foes...

64
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,850
What did you say?!

65
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,430
As I said, it was easy to take for foes...

66
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,270
Who has a fake nose?!

67
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,710
Do you find this nose funny?!
Just like a fake nose?!

68
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,610
You have it all wrong!

69
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,030
It's huge and all red?!

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,550
Help!

71
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,670
--H-Here it comes...
--T-The Devil Fruit power...

72
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,590
Who am I?

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,890
C-Captain Buggy...

74
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,560
What happens if someone defies me?

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,860
A flashy death awaits them...

76
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,130
Please forgive me!

77
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,260
I'll never say it again!

78
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,900
Please forgive me!

79
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,660
I'll overlook your verbal slip-up
and forgive you just this once.

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,260
Now get that map back! Screw up...
and you know what happens.

81
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,420
Yes, Captain Buggy!

82
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,270
Yum!

83
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,600
Do you live alone in this house?

84
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,640
I don't live in this town.

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,180
Everyone here ran away because of Buggy.

86
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,110
--Then you're a sneak thief.
--How rude!

87
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,110
I'm a thief who only
steals from pirates!

88
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,880
Don't compare me
to scumbag sneak thieves!

89
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,820
But a thief's a thief.

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,790
My goal is to earn 100 million Berries,
no matter what it takes.

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,570
What do you need that much for?

92
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,480
It's a secret!

93
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,050
But with a map of the Grand Line,
100 million is a real possibility!

94
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,630
A map? Are you a navigator?!

95
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,300
Much more skilled than
your average navigator!

96
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,230
Oh, that's perfect!
Do you wanna be our navigator?!

97
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,330
Really?

98
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,690
Yeah! Our new pirate crew member!

99
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,150
No!

100
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,320
So you're a pirate?

101
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,840
Yeah. I swore to the person
who gave me this straw hat...

102
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,990
that I'd gather a crew
and become a pirate!

103
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,120
There's nothing I hate more
in this world than pirates!

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,040
I only like money and tangerines!

105
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,590
Hey. Be our navigator.

106
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,880
I said no.

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,020
No?

108
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,180
--Hey! You find her?!
--Can't find her anywhere!

109
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,450
Where'd that girl thief go?!

110
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,090
We're in trouble if
we don't get that chart back!

111
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,940
I gotta do something about them...

112
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,180
Well, I might consider it
if you agree to certain conditions!

113
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,190
Really?! I'll do anything!

114
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,580
I want you to come with
me to see Buggy the pirate.

115
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,200
But!

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,840
Why am I tied up?

117
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,880
It's just rope.
Is there a problem?

118
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,720
Oh well! I was hoping to
meet other pirates! Let's go!

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,130
Hold on, now!

120
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,920
What?!

121
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,970
The thief got away?!

122
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Please forgive us, Captain!

123
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,060
All three of you are pathetic!
Die flashily!

124
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,710
Captain Buggy!

125
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,720
What is it?!

126
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,740
That thief from earlier
came back on her own!

127
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,570
What?!

128
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,570
That's them!

129
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,840
She's the one who stole the chart!

130
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,410
Ow!

131
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,850
I've captured the thief,
Captain Buggy the Clown!

132
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,170
Here's your chart back!

133
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,720
I appreciate it.

134
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,090
But why the change of heart?

135
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,840
My boss and I had a fight!
I'm fed up with him!

136
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,140
Please let me join your crew!

137
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,320
C-Captain Buggy is angry!

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,400
He's gonna use his Devil Fruit power!

139
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Devil?

140
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,360
Fed up, huh?

141
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,010
You're a flashily amusing girl!

142
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,130
I like you!
You can join my crew!

143
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,650
Infiltration successful!

144
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,280
Pirates are so dumb
and easy to manipulate!

145
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,130
Why am I in a cage?

146
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,720
I feel great today!

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,180
Girl! What name do you go by?

148
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,120
Nami!

149
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,250
Alright! Let's hold a
welcome party for Nami here!

150
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,350
Celebrate flashily!

151
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,240
What's wrong?!
This party's in your honor!

152
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,770
Eat up!

153
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,210
Yes! Thank you!

154
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,180
I'll just keep my eyes peeled for
a chance to take the chart back.

155
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,740
And maybe I'll swipe all of
Buggy's treasure too, while I'm at it!

156
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,980
I... wanna eat, too!

157
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,240
Dammit!

158
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,870
This is flashily great!

159
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,840
Men! Prepare
a Special Buggy Ball!

160
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,020
All set, sir!

161
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,160
W-What's about to happen?

162
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,260
Observe the might of the Buggy Ball!

163
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,910
Light it.

164
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,360
What's that explosion?

165
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,400
One of Buggy-sama's
beloved Buggy Balls!

166
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,500
Buggy Balls?!

167
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,350
Truly flashy!

168
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,790
With Buggy Balls and Devil Fruit powers,

169
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,310
I can conquer the Grand Line!

170
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,930
Right, Nami?!

171
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,900
Y-Yes! Of course!

172
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,390
Eh?!

173
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,110
I'm the one who's
gonna rule the Grand Line!

174
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,980
What?

175
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

176
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,400
You idiot!

177
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,970
I see why you're sick of him, Nami!

178
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,270
Yeah! He takes the world too lightly...

179
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,840
and misunderstands everything!

180
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,400
I couldn't put up with it anymore...

181
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,450
Naturally!

182
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,170
In that case, I'll give you a
Buggy Ball to blow away your old boss!

183
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,350
It'll also serve to prove
your loyalty to me. Do it!

184
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,100
No, that's okay!

185
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,190
C'mon, this is a welcoming party!
Let's have fun!

186
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,240
Do it.
This is my style of welcoming party.

187
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:42,650
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

188
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,740
If I don't shoot, I'll be killed!

189
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,520
But if I do shoot, I'll wind
up no better than pirates!

190
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,240
Alright! Light it flashily!

191
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:21,290
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

192
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,170
Nami! Don't wimp out on me now!

193
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,010
What's the matter?

194
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,800
Your hands are shaking!

195
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,720
That's what happens when you take
on pirates with half-assed resolve.

196
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,170
Resolve to do what?!

197
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,390
To kill people like it's nothing?!

198
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,110
Is that a pirate's resolve?!

199
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,000
No!

200
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,700
The resolve to put your own life on the line!

201
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:55,450
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

202
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,140
Hey, new chick!
Quit bein' a tease!

203
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,870
This is how you light it!

204
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,230
What the--?! What the--?!

205
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,770
Crap! I didn't mean to--

206
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,070
Nami! What is the meaning of this?!

207
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,560
I'm sorry!

208
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,280
What?! Apologizing won't fix things!

209
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,040
Huh? Now you're saving me?

210
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,240
Don't be stupid!

211
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,160
I only did it because of the situation!

212
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,680
I just didn't want to wind up
like these inhuman pirates!

213
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,250
Oh, the situation!

214
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,840
Pirates took the life
of a person dear to me!

215
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,820
As if I'd ever be one!

216
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,630
Oh, so that's why... Huh?

217
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,600
It's lit!

218
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,030
Keep your ridicule to a minimum, girl!

219
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,310
Kill her flashily!

220
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,850
Yahoo!

221
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,780
Water! Water! Water! Water!

222
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Not good!

223
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,380
You're...

224
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,270
Behind you!

225
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,350
Die flashily!

226
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,070
Hey, now...

227
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,540
How many of you are
taking on one girl at once?

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,790
Zoro!

229
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,020
You hurt?

230
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,630
Are you hurt?

231
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,350
N-No, I'm fine...

232
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,460
Whew, what a relief!

233
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,030
How'd you find us?
Hurry and get me outta here!

234
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,820
What do you keep playing around for?

235
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,920
First some bird runs off with you,
and now you're inside a cage?

236
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,190
It's pretty interesting, actually.

237
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,880
"Zoro"?

238
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,610
T-That's what he just called him, right?

239
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,530
The crew member he mentioned...
was Pirate Hunter Zoro?

240
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,670
What's going on?!

241
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,920
So you're Zoro?

242
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,160
What do you want? Are you here
to take my head or something?

243
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,000
Nope. Not interested.
I gave up pirate-hunting.

244
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,940
I'm interested, though!
Killing you will increase my name.

245
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,010
I wouldn't try it. You'll die.

246
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,730
Oh? That so?

247
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,270
Guess words aren't enough for you...

248
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,740
--Get 'im, Captain!
--Captain Buggy!

249
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:27,620
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

250
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,400
Die flashily!

251
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,200
He had no resistance to him at all...

252
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,700
Whoa! He's weak!

253
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,280
No way...

254
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,920
What's with them?

255
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,790
H-Huh? Their captain's been killed...

256
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,840
But they're laughing!

257
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,170
Hey! What's so damn funny?!

258
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,580
Zoro!

259
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,430
What's that arm?!

260
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,760
What... the hell?!

261
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,200
The Chop-Chop Fruit...

262
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,750
That's the name of
the Devil Fruit I ate!

263
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,500
I'm a chop-chop person who can't be cut!

264
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,720
His body reattached itself!

265
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,100
I thought the
Devil Fruits were only a rumor!

266
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,350
A chop-chop guy?!
You mean he's a monster?!

267
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,560
"Rubber Person"

268
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,660
I didn't hit any vital spots,

269
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,020
but that's a pretty
serious wound! I win!

270
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,480
You're too much, Captain!

271
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,970
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

272
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,460
Crap! The tables have turned!

273
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,330
If we don't do something quick,
me and these two guys are dead!

274
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,540
That one hurt a bit...

275
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:45,470
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

276
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,000
Stabbing him from behind is unfair,

277
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,390
Big Nose!

278
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,360
Y-You idiot!
Don't call him that!

279
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,820
Who's... got a big nose?!

280
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,820
Luffy!

281
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,830
Buggy!

282
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,360
I will kick your ass!

283
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,930
Kick my ass?
You're a real riot!

284
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,930
All three of you are
gonna die here, you know!

285
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,290
How should I have my ass
kicked in this situation?!

286
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,200
It's no use...
It's all over...

287
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,230
I refuse to die!

288
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Run! Zoro!

289
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,400
What?!

290
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,520
Wait! He came here to save you!

291
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,080
What're you gonna do?!

292
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Understood.

293
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,750
Nothing makes sense anymore!
This is why I hate pirates!

294
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,880
Impudent fool!
As if I'd let you escape!

295
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,600
Fool!
Your Three-Sword Style has no effect on--

296
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,440
Hey! Listen when
people are talking!

297
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,460
Oh, crap!
The cannon's pointed this way!

298
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,930
--Hey! Light it!
--Eh?!

299
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,550
--Hurry!
--R-right!

300
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:52,120
Wait, wait, wait! There's still
a Special Buggy Ball in there!

301
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,160
You lit it!

302
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,690
Wait! No! Stop! Stop!

303
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,320
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

304
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,260
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

305
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,350
before someone else could
beat me to it

306
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:52,450
If the world is going to change

307
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:59,570
before I can even attain my dream

308
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,690
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

309
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:19,680
so that my memories won't fade

310
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,690
Hey, Zoro! Are you okay?!

311
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,640
Yeah, don't worry. I'm better now.

312
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,240
Great!

313
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,670
What're you talking about?!
You can't possibly be better!

314
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,340
Really?

315
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,860
Oh no! What's that?!

316
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,520
--What an unfriendly dog!
--I'm not referring to that!

317
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,030
Oh!
There's a polar bear on top of a lion!

318
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,060
They followed you guys here!

319
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,540
On the next episode of One Piece!

320
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,750
"Desperate Situation!
Beast Tamer Mohji vs. Luffy!"

321
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,220
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
