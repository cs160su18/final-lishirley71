2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,970
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,670
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,240
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,410
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,360
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,440
They were merciless.

48
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,320
Wha--? M-M-Marriage?!

49
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,530
Don't be stupid! I won't let that happen!

50
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,110
He's got guts to marry Nami...

51
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,560
And there is a giant version of me?

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,500
That's how you make a zombie?

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,680
So we need to find a zombie in sandals,
Luffy's giant, and the cook's dogguin.

54
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,380
Our shadows will come back if we
throw salt in their mouths, right?

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,090
But honestly, I'm amazed you
discovered that weakness.

56
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,300
All of our info came from that bag of bones,

57
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,140
from how to defeat the zombies
to how to rescue you guys.

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,060
He...

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,450
He's a real man!

60
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,820
Didn't you say, "I got so
lonely that I wanted to die"?

61
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,900
If I were you, I would have
taken my own life ages ago.

62
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,400
You're doing all of this because
you want to keep a promise...

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,790
What exactly did you promise your crewmates?

64
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,070
It's quite simple.

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,350
Long ago, we left a member of my
crew behind at a certain location.

66
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,970
It was unavoidable, yet sad.

67
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,930
When we set sail, we vehemently
swore that we would return.

68
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,710
But then we were annihilated on these seas,

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,770
preventing us from keeping our promise.

70
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:03,820
I believe it has been... fifty years
now since the day we died.

71
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,750
Fifty years?! Hey, that was ages ago!

72
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,240
I wasn't even born yet!

73
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,200
Sorry, but I doubt he's been waiting that long!

74
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,420
What right do I have to decide
whether or not he's still waiting?

75
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,510
We swore to reunite with my crewmate
off some capes. His name is...

76
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,800
...Laboon!

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,220
I doubt he will forgive us for
irresponsibly dying on him...

78
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,310
We made a selfish promise

79
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,980
and died under a distant sky
where our voices couldn't reach him.

80
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,190
"I'm sorry we died" could never cut it!

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,990
We gave our word as men that we would return!

82
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,660
And that's why he's still alive...

83
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,150
Laboon...

84
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,550
Seriously?

85
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,430
It's him...

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,310
Yeah.

87
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,520
Oh, yeah. Chopper wasn't there for this, huh?

88
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,860
We know him.

89
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,200
We know that whale.

90
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,750
"I Swear to Go See Him!!
Brook and the Cape of Promise!"

91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,920
You know him?!

92
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,000
Why? How'd you meet?

93
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,460
Twin Capes is at the
entrance to the Grand Line.

94
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,220
A freakishly huge whale was there...

95
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,760
Nami-san! I see a mountain up ahead!

96
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,940
A mountain?! That can't be!

97
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
But it's really there!

98
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,020
Who cares?! Go!!

99
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,540
Hm?

100
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,220
Oh, crap!!

101
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,030
It's not a mountain!!

102
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,320
It's a black wall!!

103
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,470
No, it's not!!

104
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,940
Then what is it?!

105
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,800
I-I-It's a whale!!

106
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,000
Wh-Wh-What're we gonna do?!

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,990
--Shall we fight?
--Idiot! There's no way we can fight that!

108
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,560
B-B-But our path is blocked!
What're we gonna do?!

109
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,220
Oh, yeah! I've got an idea!

110
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,770
Luffy...? Hey, what're you doing?!

111
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,310
It doesn't work! The ship doesn't turn!

112
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,950
--Dammit!
--Don't give up!

113
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,550
Is this it...?!

114
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,770
Cannon?!

115
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,730
All right! Did it stop?

116
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,230
Ah... We're screwed...

117
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,660
This might be it...

118
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,410
My special seat...!

119
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,400
Let's get out of here before it's too late!!

120
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,540
What the heck is going on?!

121
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,200
Did he not notice the cannon attack
because his body's too big?!

122
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,550
Or is he just slow?!

123
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,130
Who knows?! Anyway,
let's get out of here now!

124
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,360
Ahhh! My ears hurt!

125
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,050
Paddle! Just paddle!!

126
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,510
We have to get away from him!

127
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,900
Luffy...?

128
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,730
You...! What the hell did
you do to my special seat?!

129
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,160
Dumbass!!

130
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,420
Wh-What?

131
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,150
--Luffy!
--Luffy!

132
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,360
I'm not gonna die!!

133
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,500
Thanks to Luffy's silliness,
we got swallowed whole.

134
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,510
Th... The whale ate you?!

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,970
And that was Laboon, right?

136
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,200
Right. There was an ancient lighthouse
keeper who lived inside the whale.

137
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,430
What?!

138
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,980
Flower pops!

139
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,820
He had been treating Laboon from the inside.

140
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,120
The lighthouse keeper was treating him?

141
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,170
Supposedly he used to be
the medic on a pirate ship.

142
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,630
Yeah? But why did he
need treatment? Was he sick?

143
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,040
He was continually bashing his head

144
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,580
against the Red Line, which is
like a wall dividing our world.

145
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,680
He's been waiting fifty years for some
pirates who promised to come for him

146
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
after they traveled around the world.

147
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,000
But fifty years...? Those pirates sure
are making him wait a long time...

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,070
Idiot! This is the Grand Line.

149
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,930
They're dead.

150
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,690
No matter how long he waits,
they won't come back.

151
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,280
Yeah, it's true that fifty years ago
the Grand Line was an uncharted sea

152
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,550
more terrible and chaotic than it is now.

153
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,920
Why are you talking so hopeless?!
You don't know that for sure yet!

154
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,400
They might come back!
It's a very touching story!

155
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,920
A whale continues to believe in the
promise with his friends... Right, pops?!

156
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,940
Yeah... But reality is cruel.

157
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:03,270
I confirmed it using reliable information.
They ran away... from the Grand Line.

158
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,790
Can't be... Don't tell me...
they left without him?!

159
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,490
Even if they are alive,
they'll probably never come back here.

160
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,940
Seasons. Weather. Current. Wind direction.

161
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,360
They are all random. Common sense
is useless in the Grand Line.

162
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,140
The terror of the Grand Line takes
over weak minds in an instant.

163
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,610
They abandoned this whale?!
When he's been waiting for fifty years...?!

164
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,560
That's cruel!

165
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,740
If you know that, why haven't you told him?

166
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,440
That whale can understand
what people say, right?

167
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,880
I did tell him... everything.

168
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,890
Listen to me, Laboon! They're not gonna...

169
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,730
I understand you don't wanna accept it.

170
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,830
But you somehow have to accept it...

171
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,200
Laboon!

172
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,250
Laboon!

173
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:51,380
It's since then that he started
howling at Reverse Mountain

174
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,870
and that he started slamming
his body against the Red Line...

175
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,750
It's as if he's insisting that they'll come back
from the other side of that wall any time now...

176
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,150
What a whale...

177
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,960
When there's no point in waiting...

178
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,660
He refuses my words because if he accepts them,
it means that there is no point in waiting.

179
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,220
He's afraid of that more than anything.

180
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,020
He's from the West Blue.
There's no way of going back there now.

181
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,840
That's why those pirates he came here
with are his only buddies and hope.

182
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,430
Look at the scars on his forehead!

183
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,820
If he continues to hit his head hard
like that, he'll die without doubt.

184
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,050
It's a strange relationship, but
I've been with him for 50 long years.

185
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,910
I can't just stand by and watch him die now.

186
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,360
Hmph!

187
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,610
--Huh?
--What's that idiot doing?

188
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,120
When we looked away for a second...

189
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,610
Is he pretending he's mountain
climbing or something?

190
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,990
Gum-Gum...

191
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,590
...Flower Arrangement!

192
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,960
Isn't that a mast?

193
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,910
Yep. It's from our ship.

194
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,640
It's the main mast... Hey! Don't break the ship!

195
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,900
What the hell are you doing?!

196
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,220
Wha...?! Hey, kid!

197
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,210
Don't worry. He doesn't die
even when he's crushed!

198
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,840
Ha! Dummy!

199
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,050
What does he think he's doing?!

200
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,270
Luffy! What the hell are you trying to do?!

201
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,290
It's a draw!

202
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,280
I'm strong, aren't I?

203
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,830
You wanna defeat me, don't you?!

204
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,790
Our fight isn't over yet!
So we have to fight again.

205
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,500
Your buddies're dead,
but I'm your rival forever.

206
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,590
We definitely have to fight again
in order to decide who is stronger.

207
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,380
After going around the Grand Line,
we'll come back to see you again.

208
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,680
When I come back, let's fight again!

209
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
Hmmm. This is good.

210
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,430
This is the symbol of our
promise to fight again.

211
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,100
Until we come back, don't remove that
mark by hitting your head. Got that?!

212
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,250
All right!

213
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,130
See ya, flower pops! Thanks for the log pose!

214
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,110
Yeah. Have a safe trip!

215
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,860
See ya, whale! I'm leaving now!

216
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,560
To Whisky Peak...

217
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,980
...full speed ahead!!

218
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,430
Yeah!!

219
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:54,580
Luffy got him to stop killing himself
by hitting his head on the wall,

220
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,970
so he's still alive...

221
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,430
Even now, he's waiting for his
crewmates back at those capes.

222
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,830
It's an unbelievable story.

223
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,310
Both sides have been keeping
their promise for fifty years!

224
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,820
I had no idea one of the people
Laboon has been waiting for...

225
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,030
...was that skeleton!

226
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,970
I, too, have grown stronger
during these past five years!

227
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,310
We share the same thought patterns!

228
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,870
I see you still hold your afro dear.

229
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,700
You cannot possibly hope to
defend such a large weakness.

230
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,380
Silence!

231
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:24,230
Laboon, do you still remember us?

232
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,590
My heart grows tight
whenever I think about you.

233
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,570
Although I don't have a heart anymore!

234
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,530
We were not strong enough to face
the harsh cruelty of the Grand Line!

235
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,120
All of our friends have died!

236
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,140
As for me, I lost everything along with
my crewmates, including my face and body...

237
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,230
Even if we were to meet again,
you probably wouldn't recognize me

238
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,840
now that I've been reduced to a skeleton!

239
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,630
Don't! Don't!

240
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,110
Don't hurt my afro!

241
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,900
I have nothing left...

242
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,530
But I want to protect this hair,
which everyone said resembled you!

243
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,310
Seeing them like this, they look just alike!

244
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,050
Brook's hair really resembles Laboon!

245
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,800
Hey, Brother!

246
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,430
I will protect the last remnant of who I was!

247
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,270
I swear I will go see you!

248
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,090
So I'd like you to keep waiting...

249
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,820
...at the capes...

250
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,700
...where we made our promise.

251
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,960
I love that bag of bones
and that whale, dammit!

252
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,050
Shuddup!

253
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,450
Now I'm getting excited!

254
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:19,980
He's a musician, a talking skeleton,
has an afro, goes "Yo-ho ho!"

255
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,250
and was Laboon's pal!

256
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,110
He's coming aboard our ship,
even if I have to drag him.

257
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,950
He's joining our crew! Any objections, guys?

258
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,660
If there were, would you change your mind?

259
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,290
I wanna help him see Laboon again!

260
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,980
You've got my vote, dammit!

261
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,920
Same here, dummy!
I'm not afraid of that skeleton!

262
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,970
That's a given. I'm more concerned
about stopping Nami-san's marriage!

263
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,270
Hey, Zoro! Where are you going?

264
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,930
I'm going to raid the place. Don't we
have one more shadow to recover now?

265
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,100
Sweet! Guys, get ready for our counterattack!

266
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,170
We're gonna knock
Thriller Bark outta the water!

267
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,960
Yeah!

268
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,960
--Go!
--You're coming, stupid!

269
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,800
Unforgiveable! Who's trying
to marry Nami-san?!

270
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,090
Oh, I forgot to mention this,

271
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,100
but when Nami was in the bath,
that invisible man--

272
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,860
What did you just say?! Wh-Wh-What did
he do when she was in the bath?!

273
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,010
He looked her up and down.

274
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,980
The bastard!

275
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,640
On the next episode of One Piece!

276
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,010
"Food, Nami, and Shadows!!
Luffy's Enraged Counterattack!"

277
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
