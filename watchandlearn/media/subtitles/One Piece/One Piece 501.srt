2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,330
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,860
Luffy was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,530
There is, however, an untold
story of the brothers...

62
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,620
...10 years ago in the East
Blue - Luffy and Ace as boys.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,170
Sabo who became brother to Luffy and Ace...

64
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,600
...has been brought home by
his father, a member of the nobility.

65
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,970
I'll do as you say. I'll
live as you want so...

66
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,680
...please don't hurt these two!

67
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm begging you. They're very important
to me, they're my brothers.

68
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,030
We all have to keep quiet about the plan!

69
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,860
What if someone outside the
town finds out about it?

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,370
We're special! If you're
from a noble family...

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,230
Run! Ace! Luffy!

72
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,680
"The Fire Has Been Set! The
Gray Terminal in Crisis!"

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,270
Wait! Stop!

74
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,270
Of course, I know. What about it?

75
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,570
They're setting boxes of oil and
explosives all over the Gray Terminal.

76
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,300
A-Are you alright?

77
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,580
Outta my way!

78
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,380
I-I have to tell them!

79
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,800
Hey you! Watch out! You have to be careful.

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
Ouch!

81
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,010
--We got him!
--Hey, relax!

82
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,060
Ace! Luffy!

83
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,150
Huh? Burn down the Gray Terminal?!
Why are you doing that?!

84
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,490
You fool! Don't scream! We can't
let anyone else know about this!

85
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,330
This is serious! I gotta tell everybody!

86
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,200
He's a bad guy just as I thought!

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,910
I told you to not to scream.
Hey, hold them down.

88
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,710
I'm not the mastermind.

89
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,050
There was oil and explosives in the boxes

90
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,220
that you guys carried yesterday and today.

91
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,930
And there's gonna be a massive
fire that no one can escape from.

92
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,300
--No...
--Are you out of your mind?

93
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,650
Even punk kids like you two are freaking out?

94
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,900
But now you know about the plan.

95
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,900
We can't let you go.

96
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,960
I want to ask you something before the fire.

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,250
Say, you two, do you have a
treasure hidden away somewhere?

98
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,110
Get in here!

99
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,300
You've given me nothing but
trouble! You're such a bad son!

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,230
I was right to adopt another
child just as I thought.

101
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,890
Open up, dad! I gotta go!

102
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,630
There are people that I have
to help! Dad! Dad! Open Up!

103
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,590
I...!

104
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,400
EDGE TOWN

105
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,990
Shut up!

106
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,370
H-Hey! Look at that!

107
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,120
Something's wrong with the Gray Terminal.

108
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,620
Isn't it burning?

109
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,340
This is the best game I've ever played!

110
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,180
B-B-Boss! Boss! You gotta see this!

111
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,100
What are you screaming about?

112
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,350
--The sky in the north, look!
--Is it the town?!

113
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,810
No, closer than that! Must be
the Gray Terminal! It's on fire!

114
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,150
DOWNTOWN

115
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,150
What's going on? It's like a wildfire!

116
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,690
It's never happened before!

117
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,990
It's dangerous - evacuate Edge Town!

118
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,620
EDGE TOWN--GREAT GATE

119
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,620
All residents must head to Downtown!

120
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,460
Leave the lifesaving and fire
extinguishing to us military!

121
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,420
--We made it to the Great Gate!
--We're safe now!

122
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,550
Wh-What are you doing?!

123
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,390
We only protect the residents here!

124
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,020
--No way!
--How can you do this?!

125
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,820
--Let us get in!
--Help us, please!

126
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,250
--Everybody, wake up!
--You gotta run!

127
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,340
--The fire is spreading all around!
--We can't stay here!

128
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,590
It's no use, give it up!
You gotta flee your home!

129
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Oh! The fire has gotten to the shore already!

130
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,060
The entrance to the forest is ablaze, too!

131
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,770
Damn! Where should we go?! We're stuck!

132
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,900
Burn everything, guys!

133
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,030
When we complete this task,

134
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,260
my long-cherished dream will come true!

135
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,940
You're right.

136
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,040
We don't give a damn
about the other people living here.

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,130
But even if this place is so crappy,

138
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,880
it's good enough for us to hide in, King.

139
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,040
I'm aware of that, Bluejam.

140
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,300
But when this is over, you
no longer need to hide.

141
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,230
I will make you and your friends
nobles by my authority.

142
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,980
Will you really?!

143
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,150
The king will give us titles

144
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,150
and we'll live in the High
Town as privileged nobles!

145
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,710
We better get moving.

146
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,340
Let's get to the Great Gate!
The military is waiting.

147
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,050
Captain, we left the brats in the hideout...

148
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,010
Forget 'em. They could've joined my crew
if they told me where the treasure was.

149
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,310
Fools can't live long anyway.

150
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,980
But it's closed, Captain!

151
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,650
Don't panic. They just don't
want other people to get away.

152
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,860
The plan is for me to give them a sign,
then they'll open the gate.

153
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,520
It's me, Bluejam. Open up.

154
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,870
Hey! Don't you hear me?!

155
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,610
Is this...

156
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,200
Captain, could it be...

157
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,620
Hey, you guys, what are
you doing?! Open the gate!

158
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,920
The plan was you let us
evacuate from here, right?!

159
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,480
This is not what we agreed to! You bastards!

160
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,190
What happened to your promise, King?!

161
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,400
You said that you'd make us nobles...

162
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,820
You set us up? King!

163
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,360
Dammit!

164
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
Did you hear?

165
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,000
Bluejam, a pirate in the Gray
Terminal, started the fire.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,920
That's what I thought!
No one else would do that.

167
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,640
He did it to try to keep the observers
from the World Government away.

168
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,380
How terrible he is!

169
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,470
It's hot! It's hot!

170
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,720
Yes!

171
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,180
Damn! We didn't wanna be involved in this!

172
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,770
We can't get away! I don't wanna die!

173
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,190
I'll leave you behind if
you don't stop complaining!

174
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,360
It's not hot.

175
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,360
Whoa, it's hot! No, it's not.

176
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
The fire is everywhere outside!

177
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,530
I can't breathe.

178
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,370
Yes, I can!

179
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,500
The air is hot!

180
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,870
No, it's not.

181
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,880
It's gonna be alright! I'm here with you!

182
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,550
Call the police! Sabo did it again!

183
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,400
Hello? Hello?!

184
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,140
What are you doing?! You have to evacuate!

185
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,720
Open the gate!

186
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,160
What are you talking about?!

187
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,480
You brat!

188
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,940
Take him away!

189
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,440
Ace! Luffy!

190
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
Run!

191
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,910
Stay away! Stay away from the lock!

192
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,120
No!

193
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,450
Ace!

194
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,040
Luffy!

195
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,840
--Be a good kid and evacuate!
--Don't give us any trouble!

196
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,640
A-Ace... Luffy...

197
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,460
What happened to you, boy?

198
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,630
O-Old man...

199
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,400
The royalty and nobles
are... behind the fire...

200
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,620
Believe me...

201
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,940
This town smells worse than Gray Terminal.

202
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,360
It smells like rotten people!

203
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,910
If I stay here... I'll never be free!

204
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,420
I'm...

205
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,210
...ashamed of being born a noble!

206
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,010
They finally made a kid
say this! Goa Kingdom!

207
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,890
I know how you feel. I was
born in this country, too.

208
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,850
But I still don't have enough
power to change the country.

209
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,190
Old man, you really are
listening to me, aren't you?

210
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,870
Yes, and I'll never forget.

211
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,920
Run, Luffy!

212
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,650
No... No way!

213
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,320
I can't believe it!

214
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,250
Captain, there's no chance!

215
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,000
There's no way to put out the fire!

216
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,670
We gotta give up the ship!
We can't flee to the sea!

217
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,460
Damn the King! How could he do this to us?!

218
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll show that bastard!

219
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,370
Honestly!

220
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,100
It's so annoying that the sky
in the south is bright even in the night.

221
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,840
We are sorry, your Majesty.
Let us close the curtain.

222
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,160
Say, daddy, why are the people
in the Gray Terminal not humans?

223
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,200
Why do they have to get burned?

224
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,750
As the phrase goes, "As a
man sows, so shall he reap."

225
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,200
Think about it.

226
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,380
They could have avoided their
fate just by being born nobles.

227
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,510
Born nobles?

228
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,810
You're right! They should have
chosen to be born nobles!

229
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,770
They're stupid!

230
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,560
Now, enough about those people,
you have to study for tomorrow.

231
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
You better go to bed.

232
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Okay!

233
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,320
Good night.

234
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,380
--There's no way on this side!
--We keep losing ground.

235
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,260
I don't wanna die here!

236
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,300
I wonder if those old men escaped safely.

237
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,810
This is no time to be concerned
about other people!

238
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,600
Damn! I don't even know where I am!

239
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,520
Who said that you could get away, you brats?!

240
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,900
Bluejam!

241
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,400
Why are you still here
after setting the fire?!

242
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,570
You were supposed to have escaped by now!

243
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,890
Shut up, you little shit!

244
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,500
We're hopeless, you know.

245
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,910
We have an unforeseen dilemma.

246
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,080
Humans are strange creatures, aren't they?

247
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,220
When you hit rock bottom,
you can't stop laughing.

248
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,190
They are acting weird.

249
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,390
Luffy, let's go!

250
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,560
Don't let them!

251
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,680
We worked together - we're friends!

252
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,870
We have to die together!

253
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,820
We don't wanna die with you!
Not in a million years!

254
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,480
You're so cold.

255
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,090
Come to think of it, you haven't told
me where you keep your treasure.

256
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,930
I'll save it for you before the fire
gets it. So tell me where it is.

257
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,060
Your life is in danger and all
you care about is treasure?

258
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,510
If you don't care, then tell me where it is.

259
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,270
You've gone mad.

260
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,210
If you're not gonna go
get it, it'd be a waste.

261
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,450
If nothing is done, it's gonna be
reduced to charcoal like my ship.

262
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,550
What a waste.

263
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,580
Don't be ridiculous! That treasure is...

264
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,710
Alright, I tell you!

265
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,470
Ace! You and Sabo spent a lot of time...

266
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,670
Sabo would understand!

267
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,420
What matters the most now is your...

268
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,470
What matters the most now is our lives!

269
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,860
Ace...

270
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,160
We keep our treasure from
last 6 years in this tree.

271
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,700
I see.

272
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,620
Don't cry!

273
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,040
It's alright. This is not the end.

274
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,590
What are you doing?! I told you where it is!

275
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,360
You're right. This is not the end.

276
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,310
Which means you could be lying.
You gotta come with us.

277
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,830
No way! Then it's gonna
be too late to escape!

278
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,310
Why don't you guys go on your own?!

279
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
You don't wanna mess with me now.

280
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,730
I'm determined to make a come back,

281
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,960
even if it means stealing from kids

282
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,210
so I can take my revenge on nobles.

283
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,170
And your brother is one of them.

284
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,000
They think they're so special

285
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,260
and look down on others as if we're trash!

286
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,930
Sabo doesn't think like that!

287
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,560
He's the same as them, fool!

288
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,520
He was with you both just to feel superior!

289
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,190
That's not true!

290
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,070
His parents are loaded.

291
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,610
He doesn't
have to worry about anything!

292
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,900
It was just a pastime for him.

293
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,960
He was looking down on you guys

294
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,700
and laughing to himself holding his nose!

295
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,330
Stop talking bad about Sabo!

296
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,250
Yeah, Sabo just wants to be free!

297
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,420
You little shit!

298
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,290
Luffy!

299
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,090
I'm gonna kill you!

300
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,420
Let go of me!

301
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,890
Don't touch Luffy!!

302
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,300
Luffy! You okay?!

303
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,140
What did you do?!

304
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,560
Dammit...

305
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,800
You creepy brat!

306
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,340
Do you wanna make a fool out of me, too?!

307
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,640
Shut up, you scumbag!

308
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,720
You bastard!

309
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,730
Ace!

310
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,670
Don't do it!!

311
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,680
Ace and Luffy are cornered by Bluejam!

312
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,430
Trapped among the flames with no escape,

313
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,350
Ace stands his ground and
prepares to fight alone.

314
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,840
Meanwhile, left behind in High Town,

315
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,980
Sabo finally takes action
to go after his dream!

316
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

317
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,900
"Where can freedom be found?
A Sad Departure of a Boy!"

318
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,210
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
