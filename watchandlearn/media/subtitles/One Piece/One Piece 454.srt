2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,610
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,060
Luffy has broken out of the
great prison Impel Down

51
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,030
and is headed to the Navy Headquarters
in order to rescue his brother, Ace!

52
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,700
Meanwhile, the rest of the Straw Hats...

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,920
...who had been ejected from the Sabaody
Archipelago by Bartholomew Kuma are...

54
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,350
"The Friends' Whereabouts! A Cheeper
of Giant Birds and a Pink Showdown!"

55
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,680
I see.

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,770
Sounds like the Navy HQ is harder
to break into than Impel Down.

57
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,980
They are expecting a fight
with good old Whitebeard now.

58
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,700
So the place must be filled with
the most formidable forces...

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,950
...that you can think of in the world today!

60
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:34,420
We want to avoid an all-out war but
I don't think that it's possible.

61
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,130
Meanwhile, a short time ago...

62
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,800
...at Peachy Island in the Grand Line -

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,100
GRAND LINE

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,100
Kamabakka Kingdom...

65
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,530
Dammit! All the queers on this island are...

66
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,990
You are one of us, aren't you?!

67
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,560
Wait!

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,330
Wait!

69
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,960
Wait!

70
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,470
Dammit!

71
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,250
Stay away from me!

72
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,640
What?!

73
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,890
Those queers...

74
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,390
Why are they so strong?!

75
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,600
They are...

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,190
...not ordinary queers!

77
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,740
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

78
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,520
When can I see them again?!

79
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,810
I see.

80
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,720
There've been some candies

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,120
who have had trouble
accepting themselves after coming to this island.

82
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,660
It's about time for us to put
out a helping hand to him!

83
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
By the way, is he strong?

84
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
Not that much--but his kicks aren't too bad!

85
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,710
Then, let's use the traditional
method of Kamabakka Kingdom...

86
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,750
...for first time in a long while!

87
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,180
You guys are so persistent! Why?!

88
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,560
Why are you...

89
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,430
...chasing me?!

90
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,980
Wait!

91
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,270
Why should I?! Stupid!

92
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,420
What's this building?!
But before that...

93
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,790
What's wrong with them?!

94
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,640
Damn!

95
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,190
I've been waiting for you!

96
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,410
W-W-Who are you, you bastard?!

97
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,370
It's so rude to call her
"bastard!" Call her Caro-sama!

98
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,130
Are you queen of this country?

99
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,630
Queen?! Please!

100
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,510
To be exact,

101
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm the queen...

102
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,890
...stand-in!

103
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,520
Caroline!

104
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,350
SUB

105
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,440
Caro-sama!

106
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,120
A stand-in?!

107
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,240
Kamabakka Kingdom is ruled
by the legendary queen -

108
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,950
Ivan-sama!

109
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,450
It'd be presumptuous of
me to call myself queen!

110
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,620
I don't care if you're a sub or
not, let me get this straight now!

111
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,750
I'm sick of this island!
Get me out of this place!

112
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,840
--Alright, I got it!
--Huh?

113
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,180
However, you need to fight the
strongest one of us and win!

114
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,330
How's that sound?

115
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,140
It's a deal! I'll take it!

116
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,040
Okay!

117
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,820
Then you need to change into our
traditional fighting costume!

118
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,640
W-What?! Fighting... costume?

119
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,800
Is this the fighting costume...

120
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,430
...that you were talking about?!

121
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,810
Cute!

122
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,560
Quit it! Shut up!

123
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,060
I can't stand this much longer!

124
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,610
I'll finish this with a
single blow in a jiffy!

125
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,150
And I'll finally leave this stupid island!

126
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,200
Gorgeous!

127
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,500
What?!

128
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm gonna fight you?!

129
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,590
I'm the stand-in queen of Kamabakka Kingdom

130
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,550
and at the same time, the grand master
of Kamabakka style--New Kama Kempo!

131
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,140
--...Stand-in!
--Are you standing in for everything?!

132
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,400
Alright! Let's just do this!

133
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,360
I'll show you my technique!

134
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,490
I don't intend to give you a chance!

135
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,660
Because I'm gonna finish
you with this attack!

136
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,580
Concasse!

137
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,250
It's over!

138
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,550
Where is he?

139
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,260
I'm here, candy-chan!

140
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,310
Damn you!

141
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,950
How odd! Why can't I land a single blow?!

142
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,620
And what's up with his eyes?

143
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,780
And that weird movement?

144
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,370
Augh! Don't tell me that he's...

145
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,370
You look good!

146
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,380
Hey, hey, don't look at it!

147
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,970
I mean, why should I be embarrassed
by showing my underwear?!

148
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,310
That's your maiden-like modesty
that you can't disguise!

149
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,980
Shut up! That's so stupid! I'm a man!

150
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,840
I don't care if you see my underwear!

151
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,150
Oh no!

152
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,700
Your kicks are lower than before!

153
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,240
You're embarrassed as I thought!

154
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,450
See?

155
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,910
Don't measure it!

156
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,960
That's because you have doubt in your heart!

157
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
That can't be it!

158
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,000
Are you sure?!

159
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,170
N-No, don't!

160
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,010
It looks like you're deceiving
yourself just as I thought!

161
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,410
What?!

162
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,930
Be true to yourself!

163
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,860
So, why did you stop kicking?!

164
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,230
Do you want me to attack you now?

165
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,320
New Kama Kempo Technique:
Awakening of the Inner Maiden!

166
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,380
Why? Why? It's just my underwear! But yet...

167
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,710
...it's so embarrassing!

168
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,880
Whoa! No!

169
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,180
Huh? Did I just scream like a girl?

170
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,140
N-No way!

171
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,270
But what is this feeling?!

172
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
I don't understand!

173
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,900
I'm...

174
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,690
I'm...

175
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,400
...about lose myself...

176
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,900
...myself...

177
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,990
...and become somebody else!

178
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
"Dear Nami-san, Robin-chan,
how are you both doing?"

179
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,010
"I'm looking forward to seeing you two!"

180
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,220
"When the time comes, I'm sure
that we'll become good friends!"

181
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,790
This is Birdie Kingdom in the South Blue

182
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,460
SOUTH BLUE "BIRDIE KINGDOM"

183
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,460
where birds reign supreme.

184
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,850
I really wanna get off this island.

185
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,350
This place is the worst.

186
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,140
Birds treating me like a toy.

187
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,030
And humans trying to eat me in a hot pot.

188
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,240
And the birds and the humans are...

189
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,070
...always fighting.

190
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,170
What should I do?

191
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
Here, I got you something to eat!

192
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,910
How are your legs?

193
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,030
Did they get any better? Let me see.

194
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,400
Stay still!

195
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,490
Oh! They look okay now!

196
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,700
Here, go ahead and eat these.

197
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,600
You were lucky.

198
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,300
I was just searching for various
kinds of herbs at the time...

199
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,350
This is for stomach trouble.

200
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,160
What was that?!

201
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,150
The humans are after me again?!

202
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,650
Oh no! They're gonna eat me in a hot pot!

203
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,960
A cheeper of the birds?

204
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,590
She must have fallen out of the nest.

205
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,300
I don't understand what she's
saying since she's a baby

206
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,060
but sounds like she's been hurt.

207
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,770
You are injured!

208
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,650
No wonder! She fell from such a height!

209
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,850
Don't move! Stop, it's gonna get worse!

210
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,110
Calm down!

211
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm a doctor!

212
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,170
You really eat a lot!

213
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,000
You know, it takes a lot of energy
just to get enough food for you!

214
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,540
But she will grow up someday
and be able to fly!

215
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,210
Then she can fly back to the nest. Oh yeah!

216
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,980
When you learn how to fly,

217
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,490
you gotta take me to Sabaody Archipelago!

218
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,320
Luffy!

219
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,400
Everybody!

220
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,630
Yeah! Then I can see Luffy and the others!

221
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,830
Promise me! And don't forget about it!

222
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,300
Hey! Stop! That tickles, you little monster!

223
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,510
No!

224
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,840
So you're gonna treat me like a toy too?!

225
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,160
It's warm!

226
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,470
It's great to see you guys again finally!

227
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,870
But I wasn't sad at all!

228
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,090
Oh? Where did she go?

229
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,930
Oh okay, since she can walk now,

230
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,410
she must be walking around a bit...

231
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,760
What?!

232
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,840
Something's wrong! From the
looks of her footsteps,

233
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,470
she must be somewhere around here.

234
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,310
I'm hungry!

235
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,980
That raccoon that we tried to cook in
a hot pot must still be here somewhere!

236
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,320
That was not a raccoon, that was a reindeer!

237
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,390
Let's catch it again and
cook reindeer hot pot!

238
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,600
--Yeah, let's do it!
--Let's do it!

239
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,130
T-This is bad!

240
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,620
Really bad!

241
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,340
Oh, it's you!

242
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,760
I'm glad that you're okay!

243
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,640
It's not over here!

244
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,100
Let's go somewhere else!

245
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,650
Yeah, good idea!

246
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,010
They didn't see us! So you were lost?

247
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,710
You're fully recovered!

248
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,020
But you gotta be quiet!

249
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,440
If you're
not, they're gonna find us!

250
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,830
Oh no! Be quiet!

251
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,460
Oh, dammit!

252
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,970
--There it is! Right there!
--There's a bird, too!

253
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,020
We're gonna have a big feast today!
Chicken hot pot and reindeer hot pot!

254
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,950
Damn! We're on a cliff!

255
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,290
You can't run anymore!

256
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,600
Give up now!

257
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,760
The birds are coming!

258
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,680
Let's shoo them away!

259
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,810
Are you guys here to save us?!

260
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,810
I've been taking care of your baby but...

261
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,610
...you don't need to thank me, you bastard!

262
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,790
Huh?

263
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,220
I saw this coming!

264
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,750
Guard Boost!

265
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
So they're fighting again...

266
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,110
I didn't know that she was her baby!

267
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,690
I'm happy for you!

268
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,860
Hey, don't forget the promise!

269
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,680
When you grow up and learn how to fly,

270
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,580
you gotta take me to Sabaody Archipelago!

271
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,750
I'm counting on you!

272
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,510
But when it will be?!

273
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,050
I can't wait that long!

274
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm sick of this place!

275
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,360
Why can't the humans and the
birds on this island get along?!

276
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,200
Luffy! Everybody!

277
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,990
Help me!

278
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,680
Robin is held prisoner in Tequila Wolf.

279
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,220
Despite the tight security,

280
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,680
the young girl Soran takes action to save

281
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,310
Robin without concern for
the danger it puts her in.

282
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,730
Meanwhile, Usopp chows down to
become the hero of the forest!

283
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

284
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,060
"The Friends' Whereabouts! Revolutionaries
and the Gorging Forest's Trap!"

285
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
