We are best friends

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,150
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,170
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,300
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,060
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,300
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,310
Tra-guy!!

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,860
However, after reuniting
with Zoro and Kin'emon,

80
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,280
Law was shot by Doflamingo before their eyes.

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,810
How dare you shoot Tra-guy!

82
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,550
Law was originally my subordinate.

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,150
Responsibility for dealing
with him falls to me!

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,000
"Luffy Astonished!
The Man Who Inherits Ace's Will!"

85
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,640
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,690
I didn't want to make you suffer before
dying but I've missed a vital spot!

87
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,590
I-I don't buy it!

88
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,650
What?!

89
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,630
I pledged my loyalty to Joker!

90
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,080
Don't make things up, Dellinger!

91
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,530
Spring Death Knock!

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,700
Uh-huh, uh-huh. I know how you feel.

93
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,620
But we don't need...

94
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,850
...a lame duck in our family.

95
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,670
Damn! I can't believe
running is all I can do!

96
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,610
But I don't buy his words!

97
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,020
Where are you, Joker?!
I need to hear it from you!

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,100
You just don't know when to give up.

99
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,770
Don't cause Young Master-sama
any more trouble.

100
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,940
Goodbye, Bellamy!

101
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,360
Barrier!

102
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,480
What do you want?!

103
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,520
Bartolomeo?

104
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,780
It's none of your business!

105
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,110
Yeah, you're right.

106
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,680
I just created this barrier because I felt like it!

107
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,220
This is our family's problem!
I'll kill you, too, if you get in my way!

108
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,540
Try it!
But no one can break my barrier!

109
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,340
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

110
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,380
Clank.

111
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,230
What?! I'm in the middle of something!

112
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,010
It's me, Dellinger.

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,350
Sounds like you haven't killed Bellamy yet.

114
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,540
You're so dull.

115
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,990
Shut up! I got interrupted!

116
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,250
Oh well, finish it up later.

117
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,140
There's another order from Doffy.

118
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,040
Guard the Toy House with
Lao G. and the others.

119
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,990
It's urgent!

120
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,870
Wait a second, Diamante!
I can just finish him off first!

121
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,000
Knock it off!
Can't you follow Doffy's order?!

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,080
Clank.

123
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,310
"Another order"?

124
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,110
That means...

125
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,490
...I've really been...

126
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,920
Screw them...

127
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,870
Screw you!

128
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,740
Get out of my way!

129
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,230
I'm gonna kick the life out of Bellamy!

130
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,020
Go away!

131
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,320
No.

132
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,990
I'm not gonna lower the barrier!

133
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,710
You just got called, didn't you?!
Just go already!

134
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,730
Damn your barrier shit!

135
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,260
This is not over, you fools!

136
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,500
I won't let you guys walk away
alive from Dressrosa!

137
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,200
Just beat it, stupid brat!

138
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,700
That was certainly Diamante
on the Snail.

139
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,330
So was it really his order?

140
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,100
Did Doflamingo really tell him to...

141
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,250
...kill me?

142
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,020
You'll promote me to executive of the Family
if I win the competition?!

143
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,130
Yeah.

144
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,760
You can do it.

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,860
I'm counting on you.

146
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,540
I will win!

147
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,380
Let me take you to the medical room.

148
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,300
Mind your own business!

149
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,230
I've lost my reason to live!

150
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,230
Why do you wanna save me
in the first place?!

151
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,340
In the battle royal earlier,

152
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,170
I was there in the ring
determined to kill you all!

153
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,290
I know!

154
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,530
But when two men fight in the same ring,
they become war brothers!

155
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,650
And I'll never walk out on my brother!

156
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,130
DRESSROSA - THE FLOWER FIELD

157
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,260
So I've filled you in on the
history of this country.

158
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,210
Now, the plan to save those

159
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,400
UNDER THE GROUND -
THE KING RIKU ARMY HEADQUARTERS

160
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,420
poor people from the darkness,

161
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,510
I call it...

162
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,940
..."Operation Dressrosa SOP"!

163
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,400
"SOP"?

164
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,510
What does it stand for?

165
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,800
There is a vast underground world
beneath this country that nobody knows.

166
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,380
Down there is a trade port for a black market
and a mysterious factory...

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,630
...where our friends of Tontatta and

168
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,800
THE FACTORY AND THE TRADE PORT

169
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,720
the people who became toys

170
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,950
are forced to work 24/7.

171
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,240
Oh! So what does SOP stands for?!

172
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,980
We'll sneak in there through

173
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,960
an underground passage which
took us a year to dig,

174
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,540
and rescue them all!

175
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,890
I see! Which means

176
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,180
there must be a deeper meaning to SOP, right?

177
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,280
Franky, enough.

178
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,220
Then, we'll destroy all the facilities there
and bring down the Doflamingo Family

179
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,940
and take Dressrosa back for King Riku!

180
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,510
That is the goal of this operation!

181
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,180
You make it sound so easy but...

182
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,860
Of course, it won't go that smoothly!

183
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,310
No one can even predict what's
gonna happen in Dressrosa

184
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,130
10 or more minutes in the future.

185
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,210
So there is one thing that
needs to be done first!

186
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,820
One of Doflamingo's subordinates
turned us into toys.

187
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,840
We have to knock out
this Hobby-Hobby Fruit eater!

188
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,110
--Hobby-Hobby Fruit?

189
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,140
You can imagine what will happen then.

190
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,360
Oh! It will break the spell?!

191
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,380
That's right!

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,800
All the toys in Dressrosa will change back into
their human forms at once!

193
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,710
And everybody will get their lost
memories back at the same time!

194
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,810
We can't predict
what will happen after that!

195
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,570
How many people will fight together with us?

196
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,510
What will people think and
what action will they take?

197
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,450
What will Doflamingo do?
What will the Navy do?

198
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,000
The only thing that's for sure is
the country will briefly destabilize!

199
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,040
Where is the Hobby-Hobby Fruit eater now?!

200
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,340
He or she must be strong, huh?

201
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,030
According to Tontatta's scouting unit,

202
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,740
she's in the underground trade port now!

203
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,780
The Don Quixote Family - the
Trebol Army - Special Officer...

204
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,670
...Sugar!

205
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,950
She is a girl

206
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,360
who can turn anything into
a toy merely by touching!

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,660
She looks like a child
but anyone who eats the

208
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,040
fruit stops aging from the
moment they ingest it!

209
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,610
Since she's the most important figure,

210
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,080
the top executive, Trebol,
is always guarding her!

211
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,190
So if we can knock her out,
all the toys can change back?!

212
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,330
That's right!

213
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,030
We'll frighten her out of her wits
and make her pass out!

214
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,010
And that's Operation...

215
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,290
Sugar!

216
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,300
Oversurprised!

217
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,450
Panic!

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,600
That's what Operation SOP stands for!

219
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,350
What a great name for the operation!

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,710
If the enemy is just a girl,
follow me, you all!

221
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,480
Alright! I'm getting all fired up!

222
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,810
Franky Hair Salon!

223
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,740
Combat Hair!

224
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,890
Fraland!

225
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,260
--Usoland!
--You're so dependable!

226
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,010
That's right! Since you've got us...

227
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,610
You're not gonna lose!

228
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,050
Take us to the underground passage,
little ones!

229
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,540
The Usolanders!

230
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:00,530
Meanwhile, Luffy is looking for the exit
in the Corrida Colosseum.

231
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,080
Huh? Forget about the exit,

232
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,140
where am I?!

233
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,550
So I will become
Luffy-senpai's henchman someday!

234
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,010
That's my dream.

235
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,900
--Don't leave it open!
--Oh, this is the bathroom!

236
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,790
Oh! Crest Head!

237
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
Glad to see you here!

238
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,510
L-L-L-Luffy-senpai!

239
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,590
Hold on, Bartolomeo!

240
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,790
Do you wanna miss an opportunity
to talk to the King of the Pirates?!

241
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,510
Oh, Bellamy!

242
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,440
Damn! He's so dazzling -
I can't even look at him!

243
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,570
Luffy-senpai, did you get
to see Zoro-senpai?!

244
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,890
Yes, I did! Thank you for that!

245
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,850
My pleasure!

246
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,630
Now I gotta go somewhere

247
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,160
so I need to get out but
I can't find the exit.

248
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,030
There is no exit in this Colosseum.

249
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,080
What?

250
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,950
Oh?

251
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,020
You're more wounded than before, aren't you?

252
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,230
Once a competitor

253
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,610
steps into the Colosseum,
he can never get out!

254
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,340
It's no use looking for the exit!

255
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,680
What?! What do you mean?!
Did you say "Never"?!

256
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,400
There's no exit?!

257
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,050
You're Doflamingo's subordinate, aren't you?!

258
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,870
Don't you know a way out?!

259
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,930
Subordinate?
I couldn't even become his subordinate!

260
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,100
Please! My friend is in danger!

261
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,040
I'm gonna get out of here now.

262
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,590
If you follow me,
maybe you can get out, too.

263
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,650
Yeah? Thanks!
So are you gonna take me?!

264
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,390
I'm just saying if you choose to follow me,

265
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,350
you might be able to find
your way out by chance.

266
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,570
You're not telling me
to betray my boss, are you?

267
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,980
Because I can't betray Doflamingo!

268
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,280
I look up to him!

269
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,610
Hey, a few moments ago,
you were...

270
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,840
Shut up!

271
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,900
I've still got some principles
that I have to stick to!

272
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,140
Okay! I'm gonna follow you!

273
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,470
But Luffy-senpai,
what about the Flare-Flare Fruit?

274
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,480
I wanna keep it out of
the hands of a few people

275
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,620
but I don't have a choice!
My friend's gonna die!

276
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,440
In that case, you can count on me!

277
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,240
Luffy-senpai! I was gonna
bring the precious keepsake

278
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,900
from Ace-sama to you once I
won it, from the beginning!

279
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,540
What?! I can have it?!

280
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,080
Of course! It belongs to you!

281
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,000
Your accent is getting heavier
as you speak.

282
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,890
I promise you I will win
the Flare-Flare Fruit

283
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,540
so you can go out without worry!

284
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,340
Who are you talking to?

285
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,210
Thanks! I appreciate it!

286
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,730
I won't let you have the Flare-Flare Fruit.

287
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,230
"Straw Hat Luffy"!

288
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,610
Who the hell are you?!

289
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,940
Hey, hey, hey! Where you from?!

290
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,100
You can't talk to Luffy-senpai so casually!

291
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,280
He is the legendary pirate
"Fire Fist" Ace-sama's brother

292
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,970
and he will become the King of
the Pirates one day, you idiot!

293
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,230
I've known that from way back.

294
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,220
What's your problem?!

295
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,460
You can't just appear and say
you won't let me have the fruit!

296
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,720
What's wrong with that guy?!

297
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,380
He's talking to Luffy-senpai
in such a cheeky manner!

298
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,890
See? Luffy-senpai's mad!

299
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,510
Y-You are...

300
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,120
It's been a while!

301
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,690
Luffy!

302
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,240
THE PLAZA IN FRONT OF THE COLOSSEUM

303
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,420
You've finally made it out
so why are you crying?!

304
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,700
You can't find Pirate Hunter?!

305
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,250
I told you not to let your
guard down repeatedly!

306
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,660
Call the Vice Admiral now!

307
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,430
Yes, sir!

308
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,650
The Navy's totally believing
we're just toys in the town!

309
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,730
Just barely!
You've chosen weird animals!

310
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,560
I thought these animals were kewl!
Especially, carps?

311
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,570
Stop crying already!
Don't you wanna save Tra-guy?!

312
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,530
I'll save Tra-guy!
And I'll kick Mingo's ass!

313
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,040
Plus, the Flare-Flare Fruit is in good hands!

314
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,070
In good hands?

315
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,610
I heard Robin-san's here
in this country, too.

316
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,660
I hope I can see her after such a long time.

317
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:55,510
KOALA - AN ASSISTANT MASTER OF FISH-MAN KARATE
THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY

318
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,490
I'm glad that you got to see him.

319
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,640
Yeah... I thought he was gonna punch me.

320
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,910
Are you crying?

321
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,730
I don't cry!

322
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,290
If you were there, do you think...

323
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,240
...you could've changed something?

324
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,160
Nobody knows.

325
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah.

326
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,750
--Let me know when you find
out about the underground.

327
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,490
Okay.

328
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,010
In any case,
I will win Ace's Flare-Flare Fruit!

329
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,330
We will inherit his will!

330
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,550
I-I never imagined he'd be alive!

331
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,540
Who are you talking about?!

332
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,560
I-I thought...

333
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,930
...he died...

334
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,120
...he died at that moment!

335
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,050
