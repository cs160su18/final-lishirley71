00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

The sun of my heart will never set

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,970

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,330
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,570
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,970
After surviving a fierce battle,

78
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,440
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

79
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,980
-- the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors.

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,990
He's torn in half! I'm sorry!

81
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,240
You fool! Sorry isn't enough! You killed him!

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,710
They came across a strange lower-half man.

83
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,040
A centaur?

84
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,200
How funny!

85
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,220
Meanwhile, Nami and the others held
captive in an unknown building...

86
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,470
These are all parts of my face.

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Could I ask you to put them back together?

88
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,860
I think there is something
wrong with the chin and the

89
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,440
top part but it's okay.

90
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,480
Thank you!

91
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,930
A severed-head just talked!

92
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,780
You just noticed?

93
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,360
There you are, intruders!

94
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,570
Huh?!

95
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,620
You have...

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,910
...those...

97
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,460
...legs!

98
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,860
They are so cool!

99
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,400
Hello? Did you find them?

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,190
Yes, we found them.

101
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,850
We were about to kill them.

102
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,430
There are four intruders.

103
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,100
I see.

104
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,020
That's exciting.

105
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,520
Please be careful!

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,520
Roger.

107
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,650
"Startling! The Secret of the
Island is Finally Revealed!"

108
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,290
Sliced up by your enemy and...

109
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,170
...Alive without your body?

110
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,170
How? I don't get it!

111
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
That's like Buggy. How weird.

112
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,130
I wish I could cut my belly
and die in obscurity but...

113
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,940
...there is something that I need

114
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,190
to do even if I have to live in disgrace!

115
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,370
By the way, do you know
where this is, old man?

116
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,290
Old man?!

117
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,250
Women can't talk to warriors like that!

118
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,380
Women have to walk three steps behind men

119
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,230
and talk modestly and humbly!

120
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,380
What did you say, you jerk?!

121
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,630
You're just a severed-head!

122
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,810
How could you say that to
someone who helped you?!

123
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,180
G-Get your hands off of me!

124
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,660
You still wanna act like that?! You...

125
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,650
Stop it, young woman!

126
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,920
What?!

127
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,350
What country are you from?!

128
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,840
You're so rude and brash!

129
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
But I assume somebody ripped off
your clothes and you're hurt.

130
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,870
You have my sympathy.

131
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,200
Nobody ripped off my clothes!

132
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,260
This is the way I dress!

133
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,220
How obscene! All you have is a breast-band!

134
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,100
Oh, you don't like it?

135
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,220
No, I love it!

136
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,680
You bastard!

137
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,060
You were leering at her!

138
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,080
That was a trap!

139
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,210
His skull must be broken. Doesn't it hurt?

140
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,650
Ouch... Ow... No, it doesn't hurt!

141
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,750
It itches!

142
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,540
It's itchy!

143
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,420
He's trying to act tough!

144
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,710
I didn't know women from other
countries only wear a breast-band.

145
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,430
I like it.

146
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,890
Stop calling it a "breast-band"!

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,030
By the way, who are you people?

148
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,660
I heard that you were taken from a ship.

149
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,610
We're pirates.

150
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,640
Pirates?!

151
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,200
You people are pirates?!

152
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,430
No wonder you people are barbaric!

153
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,790
I don't like pirates! You make me sick!

154
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,680
I was thinking about escaping
with you since we met here

155
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,970
on this island of ice by chance.

156
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,600
But it's too bad that you're pirates.

157
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,400
Hey hey, did you say "this island of ice"?

158
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,060
I thought it was a burning island.

159
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,610
He's right!

160
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,180
This place is on fire - even
the sea is burning around here.

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,140
No, wait!

162
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,980
Old man.

163
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,520
So you say it's an island of ice.

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,210
But didn't you hear those eruptions?

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,450
I heard some explosions but

166
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,790
I entered the island of ice
straight from an icy sea.

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Don't talk to me anymore, you damn pirates!

168
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,310
I thought I saw a wintry sky from the ship.

169
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,520
It wasn't just in my head.

170
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,980
The burning island that Luffy and
the others went to has a cold side.

171
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,870
That means they took us to
the other side of the island!

172
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,280
We need to find out who took us and
why by getting out of this room.

173
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,860
But Nami-san, this door is
unbreakable. We can't get out...

174
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,750
--Move aside!
--What?

175
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm filled up with cola!

176
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,020
Hey hey, wait a minute!

177
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,490
Franky...

178
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,220
...Radical Beam!

179
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,230
It's open. Let's go.

180
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,830
You don't have that bizarre body for nothing.

181
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,670
I wish I could shoot a beam like that!

182
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm sure there are irrelevant points
of being a robot too, though.

183
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,660
What are you gonna do?

184
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,750
You said you wanted to escape with us before

185
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,900
you knew we were pirates, didn't you?

186
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,190
Shut up and leave, pirate!

187
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,910
You can't make it by yourself
- all you got is your head.

188
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,780
What are you doing?!

189
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,580
Huh, samurai from the Wano Kingdom?!

190
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,620
What?! Samurai?! Is he?!

191
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,360
This is a typical Wano Kingdom hairstyle.

192
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,260
Does it mean he is the killer samurai
that the guy on the Snail mentioned?!

193
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,350
Scary!

194
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,850
I heard an explosion!

195
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Let's go! Was it those pirates?!

196
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
Huh? Did they notice already?

197
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,860
Sanji-kun, let's go! They're coming!

198
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,490
We came here because we received
an emergency signal from

199
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,490
one of your victims, samurai!

200
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,310
Sanji, we gotta go!

201
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,170
Leave the scary samurai here!

202
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,180
I don't cut people if it disgraces me!

203
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,560
I came to this island to rescue my son!

204
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,190
I don't mind cutting thousands
if they get in my way!

205
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,290
--There!
--Shoot! Don't let them get away!

206
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,230
Oh no, that'll be far enough!

207
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,130
Weapons Left!

208
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,960
How did they get out from that room?

209
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,290
Call the Master now!

210
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,650
What's wrong with them?!

211
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,770
Sanji-kun!

212
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,290
You brought him?! He's dangerous!

213
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,150
I'll take responsibility!

214
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,410
There's a door!

215
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,720
Who are they?

216
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,810
What?!

217
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,910
Giant children?!

218
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,380
Ch-Children?!

219
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,060
What's going on here?

220
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,360
There are a bunch of kids!

221
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,010
What's this place?!

222
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,240
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND--THE BURNING LANDS

223
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,110
So all of your friends have
cool hind legs like these?

224
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,160
I wanna see them!

225
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,610
Yeah! I'm sure they'll be surprised
when they see your legs!

226
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,130
Come see them!

227
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,850
All right, Hyoutauros!

228
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,630
Let's race to that burning
tower to cement our friendship!

229
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,680
Ready, go!

230
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,190
They totally go together!

231
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,570
What?! You can't find Nami and the others?!

232
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,190
Are you all by yourself?!

233
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,860
When you woke up, you were
surrounded by snow and ice?!

234
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,770
That's right!

235
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,750
I was as surprised as a bone in thunder!

236
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,800
Oh? No no, like thunder in a duck?

237
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,600
Oh no, like a duck in bone?

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,610
Who cares.

239
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,680
Oh, excuse me!

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,430
Those people who tried to steal things
from the Sunny - who were they?

241
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,400
Well, I have no idea at all.

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,610
Shoot! Shoot!

243
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,740
Huh? No, wait, you guys! Don't be so rash!

244
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,530
--Huh?
--Did he vanish?!

245
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,160
Where did he go?!

246
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,030
Boy... If you had something to say,

247
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,420
I would've listened over
a cup of tea or something.

248
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,290
There he is!

249
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,090
But I cut you already.

250
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,960
What?

251
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,340
Three-Pace Hum... Notch Slash!

252
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,400
By the way, who are you people?

253
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,350
That's how it was.

254
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,950
I cut them before I asked them who they were.

255
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,860
They all have a gas mask
kind of thing on them.

256
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,530
Gas mask?

257
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,290
Then maybe they released some
kind of gas that knocked you out.

258
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,870
And they probably moved the Sunny
to the other side of the island.

259
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,000
I lost! Damn!

260
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,640
You're fast!

261
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,630
Well, you did well too!

262
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,240
All right! Let's do it one more time!

263
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,010
--Ha! No matter how many times we...
--Ring, ring, ring...

264
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,640
--Clank.
--Hello?

265
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,470
Why are you fooling around?

266
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,610
Well, I can't find them.

267
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,670
Are there really intruders?

268
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,400
All I found is a guy with
weird hind legs that talks.

269
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,280
He is one of the intruders!

270
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,240
Come on! Let's do it!

271
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,120
What?!

272
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,040
I wonder where Nami-san and the others went.

273
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,920
If there wasn't a note,
maybe they were abducted.

274
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh yeah! They thought you were dead
since you're a skeleton, probably.

275
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,970
Oh, I see. That's why they
didn't take me. I was lucky!

276
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,440
They think they left no one on the ship.

277
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,430
Do you see any building or person?

278
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,560
Wow, Robin-san, you sound
like you can see it yourself!

279
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,170
In fact,

280
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,480
there is.

281
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,550
And it's quite an impressive building.

282
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
It doesn't look like a restaurant.

283
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,710
Brook, we'll head there
so can you wait for us?

284
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,880
Roger!

285
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh, Robin-san, could I see
your underwear when...

286
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Clank.

287
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,550
Are we facing allies of the Government?

288
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,300
I don't know but it's better if
they're human because compared

289
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,050
to what we've seen so far...

290
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,350
A fire-breathing dragon!

291
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,390
The bottom half of a man!

292
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,110
A bird woman!

293
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,840
And a centaur who just
became Luffy's friend...

294
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,820
--Why didn't you tell me?!
--What?! What's up so suddenly?!

295
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,450
You bastard!

296
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,790
I dropped my guard thinking
you were one of us.

297
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,670
Why can't I be one of you?!

298
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,590
We're friends now, don't attack me!

299
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,470
Go to hell, intruder!

300
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,760
There's one more!

301
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,760
Cien Fleurs!

302
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,390
Bellflower!

303
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,950
Who are you?

304
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,830
A panther and a giraffe, huh?

305
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,100
There are many kinds of
centaurs! How interesting!

306
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,980
It's a mythical horse! It can't be real!

307
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,980
What happened?

308
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,780
He suddenly attacked me
after talking to somebody.

309
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,120
Look at this Baby Transponder
Snail! It says "CC"!

310
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,230
They're not wild centaurs.

311
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,300
They belong to some kind of organization.

312
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,080
--"CC"?
--So they're our enemies?

313
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,200
Anyway, even if we go
back to the sea of fire,

314
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,550
the Sunny is not there!

315
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,470
The only option we have now
is to go to the ice lands!

316
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,660
Nami, Sanji, Franky, and Chopper are missing!

317
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,590
They were abducted most likely.

318
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,520
I hope they're not riddled with bullets.

319
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,470
Stop!

320
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,250
We could get there faster if we
had landed on the other side.

321
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,040
Then we wouldn't have gotten to
eat the dragon or meet Leg-maro!

322
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,140
Who's Leg-maro?

323
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,060
I named my hind legs.

324
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,750
Bu! What happened this time-bu?

325
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,440
What's going on-bu?!

326
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,260
What are we gonna do, Luffy?

327
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,790
We can rescue them if we can
get to the other side, right?

328
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,620
Then we have no choice!

329
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,980
All right! Let's go! The plan has changed!

330
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,450
Let's go to the ice lands
to rescue our friends!

331
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,930
I wonder if they're selling
winter clothes on the way.

332
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,230
Seriously, we're gonna
die from cold like this!

333
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,910
What should we do?

334
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,670
I see. They broke this impenetrable door!

335
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,810
Master!

336
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,110
This burn mark...

337
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,690
Who the hell are they?

338
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,260
I thought they were the only
ones who could generate lasers.

339
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,700
Vegapunk's Goddamn Pacifistas!

340
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,250
They haven't caught the
escapees yet, have they?

341
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,130
They're trying to corral
them into the Biscuit Room.

342
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,850
The Biscuit Room?

343
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,750
Master, are you there?!

344
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,510
Yes, I'm here.

345
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,180
A G-5's Navy ship is approaching
the northwest shore!

346
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,250
A Navy ship?! Turn them away at any cost!

347
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,550
Release large amounts of the poison gas!

348
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,760
Don't kill them--we don't want any trouble!

349
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,650
Yes, sir!

350
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,860
Vice Admiral Smoker, it's impossible!

351
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,630
THE NORTHWEST SHORE

352
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,020
I-I can't breathe...

353
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,630
The gas is still leaking!

354
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,690
Be careful! You don't wanna
inhale even a single breath!

355
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,220
Put a gas mask on!

356
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,890
What a dangerous island! Punk Hazard!

357
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,740
Ever since the failure
of that accursed old man

358
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,010
Vega Punk's chemical weapon test 4 years ago,

359
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,440
this island has rotted to the core!

360
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,060
First of all, I don't see Straw
Hat Luffy's pirate ship anywhere!

361
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,880
And no one can enter the island since

362
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,180
there is still poison gas everywhere!

363
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,900
No.

364
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,880
It's not natural that it's
still generating so much gas.

365
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,780
What do you mean?

366
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,970
2 years ago, there was no fire or ice here.

367
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,600
It was nothing but a ruined island.

368
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,630
Surprisingly, most of the
toxic substances were gone.

369
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,350
That's why Akainu and Aokiji
chose Punk Hazard...

370
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,270
...as the place for their showdown!

371
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,650
They chose it as a stage
for their big match -

372
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,950
one powerful enough even to
send the weather into chaos!

373
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,920
A mysterious group of children become
uproarious after meeting Sanji and the others.

374
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,090
During the continuous attacks
by Master's subordinates,

375
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,640
the children begin speaking an astonishing truth!

376
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,580
Nami hears their desperate pleas

377
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,140
and her decision moves the entire crew!

378
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,460
On the next episode of One Piece!

379
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,610
"Save the Children! The
Straw Hats Start to Fight!"

380
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,710
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
