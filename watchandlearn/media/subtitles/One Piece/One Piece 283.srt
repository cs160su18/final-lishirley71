2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,030
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,820
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,390
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,550
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,130
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,450
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,700
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,470
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:24,590
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,220
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,020
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,820
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,980
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,880
We are!

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,500
They've come all this way
after crossing Aqua Laguna.

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,380
When you think about it, it's incredible.

26
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,210
Seems like they've at least got good luck.

27
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,590
This time, we have permission to kill them.

28
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,480
It's easy when we don't have to
worry about going easy on them.

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,680
Drawbridge?

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,940
Yeah. The Franky Family is
currently fighting to bring it down.

31
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,730
Once it comes down, we can go
over to the other side at once.

32
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,670
Geez... When it's right in front of us...

33
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,490
CP9...

34
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,500
I thought I gave up everything...

35
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,840
I didn't want you to come to rescue me.

36
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,720
Why do you come after me?

37
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,560
"Everything Is for Her Friends!
Robin in the Darkness!"

38
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,610
I wanna talk about Nico Robin.

39
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,500
Do you know something?!

40
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,740
Did that woman change after
you guys came to this town?

41
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,860
Yes, suddenly.

42
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,950
After she went out to town,
she suddenly disappeared,

43
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,330
and by this morning, she was the
suspect of your attempted assassination.

44
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,630
When my friends finally found her,

45
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,110
she said she would no longer come back to us.

46
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,050
We didn't know what was going on.

47
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,550
So we came here tonight

48
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,560
in order to ask her directly again
why she's leaving the ship.

49
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,030
To make my wish come true...

50
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,660
A wish that can never come true if I'm with you!

51
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,660
What is this wish that can never
come true if she's with us...?

52
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,670
Let me tell you what I know.

53
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,630
It was probably when you lost sight
of Nico Robin the first time.

54
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,920
CP9...

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,920
The Government's operation
was already in progress.

56
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,300
There is, of course, a reason
for that woman's actions.

57
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,100
But before I tell you about that,

58
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,020
I want you to know that Nico
Robin and I both have a means

59
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,190
to bring back the ancient weapon
that could destroy the world.

60
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,330
Destroy the world?

61
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,700
That's right.

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,360
A problem occurred in our plan.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,780
Everyone, come to the bedroom right away.

64
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,990
Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

65
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,790
Now, you get it, Nico Robin?

66
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,390
The blueprints you guys were after are fakes.

67
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,340
Even if I am to be killed, I won't give
those blueprints to the Government!

68
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,300
But if you're sniffing around
the Poneglyphs on another front

69
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,320
and helping the Government as well,

70
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,480
then I have to stop you right here, right now.

71
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,570
I'm not seeking the Poneglyphs
in order to bring the weapon back.

72
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,080
I just want to know the history, that's all.

73
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,080
Such a claim doesn't mean anything!

74
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,510
I told you, didn't I?

75
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,710
Over... and over again...

76
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,170
Even if you don't intend to do so...

77
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,000
Weapons hurt people despite your intentions!

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,880
They can even hurt those
who mean a lot to you!

79
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,750
That which hurts people doesn't
necessarily have malicious intent.

80
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,970
If that simple curiosity of
wanting to know the history

81
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,680
leads to the destruction of the world,

82
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,350
you should die right here,
right now, Nico Robin!

83
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,980
Even after you saw the Ohara devils' fate,

84
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,460
you still want to chase
after the world's history?!

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,160
Don't talk like you know
everything about Ohara!

86
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,250
You don't even know how much the
World Government messed up my life!

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,140
If you hate the Government that much,
then why are you helping them?!

88
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,350
Because I have a wish I want to come true
even if I have to give up everything.

89
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:17,070
There're two conditions that
CP9 forced on me in this town.

90
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,570
One is to pin the assassination
on the Straw Hats.

91
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,760
The other is to turn myself in
to the Government and obey them.

92
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,250
If you do that, you'll die, too.

93
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,800
Why do you accept such conditions
after evading them for 20 years?

94
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,010
In this lone instance,
CP9 has been given permission

95
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,840
to exercise Buster Call against the Straw Hats.

96
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,270
Buster Call?

97
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,720
It's an emergency order to
summon five of the vice admirals

98
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,540
from Navy Headquarters and
ten battleships to one place.

99
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,610
Once you've been targeted by the
national war-class military power,

100
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,930
nothing will remain of you.

101
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,450
Normally, in the Navy, this authority
only belongs to the three admirals

102
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,470
and the head of the Navy, the fleet admiral.

103
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,460
But this time,

104
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,710
through the admiral Aokiji,

105
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,930
CP9 was given the authority
to exercise it just this once.

106
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,090
If I didn't accept the conditions,
Buster Call was going to be exercised on us.

107
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,100
When I heard the name Aokiji, I gave up.

108
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,890
I was always able to make good
my escape for the past 20 years

109
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,310
because I had nothing to protect...

110
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,510
Because I could betray people
and use them as a shield.

111
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,920
But I really can't do that any longer.

112
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,770
The life I once gave up on...

113
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,740
The heart that I lost...

114
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,170
The dream I could no longer have...
They picked them all up for me.

115
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,260
I was able to make friends who
would believe in someone like me.

116
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,130
Then, your wish is...

117
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,430
That the six Straw Hats, excluding me,
can leave this island safely!

118
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,340
Are you saying, for that, you don't
care if the weapon is brought back?!

119
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,580
You don't care what happens to the world?!

120
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,550
That's right, I don't!

121
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,610
Luffy!

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
What the hell are you doing there?!

123
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,250
N... Nami! Are you there behind me?!

124
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,080
Well, hey, listen!

125
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,500
At any rate, that pigeon guy sent me flying

126
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,860
and I flew right into this gap.

127
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,020
Don't fool around at a critical time like this!

128
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,960
While you've been taking your
sweet time, Robin was taken away!

129
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,720
Robin intends to die for us!

130
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,350
She sacrificed herself in order to protect
us from an attack by the Government!

131
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,900
When she knew that she was going
to be killed if she was taken in!

132
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,320
Then...

133
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,330
...after all, Robin was...

134
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,130
...lying?

135
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,990
Yes!

136
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,630
Good...

137
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,730
Whoooa! There it is!

138
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,680
This looks cool!

139
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,920
Amazing!

140
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,770
I'm warning you, this is a crazy train.

141
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,820
Its name is Rocketman.

142
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,300
We can't even allow passengers to be on board.

143
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,100
Okay! Well then, let's go, shall we?!

144
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,270
Now departing Water Seven for Enies Lobby...

145
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,960
Here comes the sea train Rocketman!

146
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,700
All right! Depart!

147
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,180
We're gonna go...! To get everything back!

148
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,070
Whoa! Cool!

149
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,020
A power strong enough to give me control
over any large country I might desire

150
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,320
is in my hands now!

151
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:16,290
Why did Aokiji give you the
authority to exercise Buster Call?

152
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,250
Huh?

153
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,180
You're in no position to ask me
questions, you insolent woman!

154
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,100
If I hadn't recognized
the value of your existence,

155
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,070
it would've been practically worthless!

156
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,490
So you should appreciate me!

157
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,050
You, the repugnant kin of Ohara,
the land of devils...

158
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,580
Nico Robin...

159
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,410
Hurry!

160
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,510
Run to the evacuation ship!

161
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,390
--Put out the fire!
--Protect the books!

162
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,300
Revealing the history isn't
what Ohara was trying to do.

163
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,910
We just wanted to accept the voices
of the past and protect them.

164
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,590
No! I'll stay here, too! Mom!

165
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,140
Mom!

166
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,240
Live, Robin!

167
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,290
Listen carefully, Robin!

168
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,300
You're alone now, but you'll
meet friends someday for sure!

169
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,990
Friends?

170
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:07,100
Right. The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...

171
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,940
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!

172
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,580
--Monster!
--Monster!

173
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,330
Her mom abandoned her!

174
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,630
No one is born into this world to be alone!

175
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,710
You will understand someday.

176
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,330
They said that she's a survivor
of those Ohara devils

177
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,430
who planned the world's annihilation.

178
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,760
Don't let her get away!

179
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,730
Now, give me the money!
I reported her to you, right?!

180
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,440
Your sin is being alive!

181
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,310
Go meet the friends who're
surely waiting for you

182
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,600
somewhere at sea, Robin!

183
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,380
Sogeking.

184
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,440
Hm?

185
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,230
Shoot through that flag.

186
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,820
Roger.

187
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,720
Huh?

188
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,020
This is my new weapon,
a huge slingshot... named Kabuto!

189
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,020
Have a good look at its power!

190
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,450
Special Attack... Firebird Star!

191
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,120
Oh, no...!

192
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,740
Mission accomplished.

193
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,710
Are you insane?! Don't think
that you'll be able to survive

194
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,430
after making the entire world your enemy!

195
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,350
Bring it on!

196
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,910
Robin!

197
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,270
We still haven't heard you say it!

198
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,170
Say you want to live!

199
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,060
To live...

200
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,590
You shouldn't be allowed
to live in this world, Robin!

201
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,800
Your existence itself is a huge crime, Robin!

202
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,770
I thought it was something I dared not wish for.

203
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,470
No one ever let me wish for it.

204
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,260
The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...

205
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,350
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!

206
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,000
If... it's really okay for me
to utter my wish for once...

207
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,950
I...

208
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,280
I want to live!

209
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,380
Take me to the sea with you!

210
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,070
Let's go!

211
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,710
Come, Nico Robin!

212
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,170
I've got the assassin group CP9 on my side!

213
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,580
Cutty Flam...

214
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,020
Here we go!

215
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
I knew it!

216
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,500
"Straw Hat Theater"

217
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,880
"Part 5"

218
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,290
Rodusa is wearing sunglasses because
she's a monster known as the Gorgon

219
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,890
who turns people to stone
when they look her in the eyes.

220
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:53,210
But she didn't have eye contact with
anyone today for a different reason.

221
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,020
There you go again, monster!

222
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,390
Now, Dragon. Give me those mystical horns.

223
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,150
You're always shooting at me.
It hurts, you know!

224
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,900
You're a monster, too!

225
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
"Centaur
Usoppaka"

226
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,790
"Dragon
Lugyao"

227
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,440
If you've got time, why don't you fish?

228
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,800
Mystical fish live in this sea.

229
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,240
--I want the mystical horns, not mystical fish.
--This is a village called
Monston in a monster forest,

230
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,760
--Like I said, catch some fish.
--I'm gonna make bugle horns out of them.
--where monsters live free from care.

231
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,650
Hey, you have a bite.

232
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,210
Oh?

233
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,830
Ahh! I got tricked by the sweet bait!

234
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,190
"Kraken (Giant Octopus)
Choperken"

235
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,790
You again, Choperken?!

236
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,350
What're you doing on the sea floor?!

237
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,260
I'm looking for a mystical treasure
that's on the sea floor right now!

238
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,030
More importantly, give me
more of those sweet baits!

239
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,390
Hey, Choperken!

240
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,410
"Mermaid
Stronamie"

241
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,410
If you lay your hands on that
mystical treasure, you'll pay for it!

242
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,770
Huh? It's laying on the sea floor,
so first come, first served.

243
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,480
Oh? You've got some nerve.
You wanna compete with me?

244
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,620
--Scary!
--Hiya!

245
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,600
What idiot is troubling my love, Stronamie-san?!

246
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,630
"Water Imp
Sanzaler"

247
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,640
I'm gonna beat him up!

248
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,170
Hey, what're you doing?
Are you trying to catch me?

249
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,420
A mystical fish.

250
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,310
I'm not a fish! I'm a water imp.

251
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,270
More like a naughty monster who lives
in the sea despite being a water imp.

252
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Give yourself up!

253
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:23,230
"Minotaur
Zoromilk"

254
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,300
What about you?! You're a minotaur,
and yet you're a Holstein!

255
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,240
Shut up. I'm gonna get that mystical
bowl on your head today for sure!

256
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,350
I'm not gonna let you have it.
It'll endanger my life.

257
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,890
More importantly, I heard that that
iron rod you have is a mystical thing.

258
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,000
Why don't you try and get it?

259
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,370
Shut up, you guys!

260
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,240
Mystical this, mystical that...
You guys are all mystical beasts!

261
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,340
Gasp!

262
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,200
But, you know, Rodusa.
You were crying the other day

263
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,830
saying that you lost your mystical earrings,

264
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,540
so we decided to give
something even rarer to you.

265
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,800
Hey, hey! Don't spill the beans!

266
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,010
What?!

267
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,230
The reason why she doesn't
look in everyone's eyes

268
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,010
is in order to hide her happiness,
embarrassment, and tears.

269
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,900
Everyone...

270
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,950
...thank you!

271
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,840
Stone...!

272
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,730
--This is Monston,
a village of carefree monsters.
--Why...?

273
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,830
Robin! Sorry to have kept you waiting!
I'm coming for you now!

274
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,500
Th-The pirates are coming here!
We have to go to the Gates of Justice now!

275
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,710
Franky?

276
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,380
Cutty Flam...

277
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,380
Don't tell me... What you have in your hand is...

278
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,220
H-Hand those blueprints over to me!

279
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,550
On the next episode of One Piece!

280
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,600
"I'm Not Gonna Hand over
the Blueprints! Franky's Decision"

281
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
