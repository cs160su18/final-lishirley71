2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,550
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,610
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,770
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,390
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,910
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,520
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,040
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,510
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,140
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,850
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,320
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:25,250
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,130
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,990
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,910
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,740
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,940
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,510
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,050
We are!

24
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,980
Crunch his head for sure this time!

25
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,620
Gum-Gum...

26
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,950
...Hammer!

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,400
Join our crew, Nami! Okay?!

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,380
How about we team up
for our common goal?

29
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,350
Alright! Fire!

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,160
"Epic Showdown!
Swordsman Zoro vs. Acrobat Cabaji!"

31
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,330
I'm here to kick your ass,
just like I promised!

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,720
Straw Hat?!

33
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,520
How dare you just come waltzing
back here, to Captain Buggy!

34
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,380
Listen! All I want is the
map and the treasure!

35
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,080
Yeah, I know.

36
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,050
Young'uns... Why are you here?!

37
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,960
Stay out of this. You're outsiders!

38
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,240
This is my fight! I will protect my town!

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,540
I don't need your meddling!

40
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,920
What the hell?!

41
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,680
Why did you attack the mayor?!

42
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,890
He was in the way!

43
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,310
Good thinking.

44
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,110
No doubt this old man
plans to die otherwise.

45
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,210
This is for the best.

46
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,330
Don't be crazy!

47
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,140
There were plenty of other
ways you could've done it!

48
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,340
Alright, here goes...

49
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,160
Big Nose!

50
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,340
That's the one thing you shouldn't say!

51
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,690
Damn you, you flashy idiot!

52
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,210
How dare you...

53
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,890
Flashily fire the Buggy Ball!

54
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,090
Why'd you say that?! You idiot!

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,200
Hey, Luffy! Run!

56
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,210
That...

57
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,600
Time to blow up!

58
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,060
...won't work on me!

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,390
Gum-Gum...

60
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,920
...Balloon!

61
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,770
What is he?!

62
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,280
Don't tell me the Buggy Ball...

63
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,870
He bounced it back!

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,780
Say something beforehand, geez!

65
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,540
It's coming this way!

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,420
Alright! Now there's fewer enemies!

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,570
What the heck are you?!

68
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,170
You really know how
to freak people out...

69
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,060
I knew something was weird from
the time you fought that lion!

70
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,690
No human can do that! Explain yourself!

71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,060
What was that balloon-inflatey
thing you just did?!

72
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,130
The Gum-Gum Balloon!

73
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,490
I'm asking what that is!

74
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,490
What are you, a monster?!

75
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,410
How dare you flashily try to do me in...

76
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,830
He used his henchmen as shields!

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,490
What happened here?!

78
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,350
You!

79
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,520
Heya!

80
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,190
The Straw Hat guy!

81
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,500
C-C-Captain Buggy! Be careful!

82
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,590
He has Devil Fruit powers too!

83
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,600
He's a rubber person!

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,480
What?!

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,100
Rubber person?!

86
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,850
Yeah! See!

87
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,300
A Devil Fruit...

88
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,820
That explains how he
bounced a Buggy Ball back.

89
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,720
This is the greatest insult we've
had since we hoisted our flag...

90
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,920
...Captain.

91
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,770
Oh, Cabaji!

92
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm so angry, I can't even fart...

93
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,290
Cabaji! What the hell
did you do to Richie?!

94
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,640
This cat?

95
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,920
I used it as a shield to keep
my clothes from getting dirty.

96
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,860
Richie!

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Hey, Richie! Say something!
Are you all right?!

98
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,810
Richie!

99
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,130
Damn you, you bastard!

100
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,340
Out of the way!

101
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,040
No, you move!

102
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,470
Captain Buggy.

103
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,740
Yes, Cabaji?

104
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,430
Please leave this to me.

105
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,720
Alright! Show them your acrobat show!

106
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,510
I, Acrobat Cabaji, Chief of Staff,

107
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,490
take on Captain Buggy's anger!

108
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,430
I'll clash swords with you.

109
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,140
It's an honor, Roronoa Zoro...

110
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,390
To think I would get to slay you,
as a swordsman myself.

111
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,260
Hey, Zoro! You should really rest!

112
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,380
I'll handle this!

113
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,400
Stay out of this!

114
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,040
That's the stab wound the
captain gave him. The fool...

115
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,560
Acrobat Technique: Old Man Arsonist!

116
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,680
What's wrong?

117
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,240
I'm sure I didn't kick you that hard...

118
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,360
He fights dirty, going
after his injury like that!

119
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,540
Acrobat Technique:
Murder at the Steam Bath!

120
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,730
Acrobat technique, my ass!

121
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,500
That's just an ordinary cloud of dust!

122
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,590
He did it again!

123
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,470
What's wrong?

124
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,140
A grown man moaning is disgraceful!

125
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,720
Well? Now do you see
how foolish it was...

126
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,000
...to make an enemy
of the Buggy Pirates?

127
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,210
He's crazy to fight while
so seriously injured!

128
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,290
He's hurt so bad, it's almost
mystifying that he's still alive!

129
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,240
Why're you just
standing there watching?!

130
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,580
He's gonna get killed!

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,740
Roronoa Zoro...

132
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,300
...is defeated!

133
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,430
Annoying bastard!

134
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,550
Is poking my wound...

135
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,050
...that much fun?!

136
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,810
Oww!

137
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,070
W-Why didn't you dodge that?!

138
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,280
Is that enough of a handicap for you?

139
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,920
Now I'll show you the difference
in level between you and me!

140
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
So cool!

141
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,970
So this is Roronoa Zoro, huh?

142
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,800
You think you can mock me...

143
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,950
My swords aim to be
the world's greatest!

144
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,560
I can't lose even once to anyone
who calls himself a swordsman!

145
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,760
I see...

146
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,400
A strong resolve keeps you going.

147
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,200
But never fear.

148
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,230
Wounds as bad as yours will be
more than enough of an excuse...

149
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,990
...for losing to me!

150
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,970
The hell with that...

151
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,000
If I lose to someone like
you with such light injuries,

152
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,270
I won't have much of
a bright future ahead of me!

153
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,350
Why, you--!

154
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,750
Do it, Zoro!

155
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,480
I can't go along with this!

156
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,880
You pirates can injure
yourselves for all I care!

157
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,920
It doesn't matter to me
whether you guys win or lose!

158
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,390
I'm gonna use this chance to swipe
their treasure and get outta here!

159
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,600
Let's team up again if
we ever get the chance!

160
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,120
See ya! Good luck with the fight!

161
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,120
Yeah! Thanks!

162
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,390
Taste my ultimate acrobatic move!

163
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Acrobat Technique:
The Dance of 100 Kamikaze Tops!

164
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,580
Those aren't normal guys,
that Luffy and Zoro!

165
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,430
Nothing good'll come from
being involved with them!

166
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,720
Here we are!

167
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,350
Now to steal their treasure
and chart and get out of here!

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,280
Acrobat Technique:
A Hike in the Mountains!

169
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,170
Acrobat Technique:
Fireworks in the Cool Summer Breeze!

170
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,410
Whoa, he's high up!

171
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,750
Sting of the Unicycle!

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,330
Ground-hugging Chop-Chop Cannon!

173
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,050
Cabaji! I'll hold Zoro down!
Finish him off!

174
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,270
As you wish!

175
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,160
Damn you guys!

176
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,930
Luffy!

177
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,650
D-Damn you!

178
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,230
Stay out of Zoro's fight!

179
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,010
Wow!

180
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,480
Look at all this!

181
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,310
And it's all mine!

182
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,510
What're you doin' with
our treasure, now?!

183
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,200
Crap! He woke up!

184
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,750
By Captain Buggy's orders,

185
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,590
anyone who gets near here is to be--

186
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,870
Huh? I'm all out?!

187
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,890
It hurts!

188
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,110
W-What?! What's wrong?

189
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,660
My chest suddenly started to hurt...

190
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,930
What?! Your chest?!

191
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,930
Hah!

192
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,950
Yes!

193
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,900
The chart of the Grand Line!

194
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,300
I can defeat you easily enough,

195
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,260
even without my captain's help!

196
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,200
Enough... I'm tired...

197
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,100
Finally given up, have you?

198
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Though I must say, I'm impressed
you could fight with such injuries.

199
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:42,440
I meant I'm tired...
of your crappy-ass acrobatics!

200
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,730
Then I'll finish you off...

201
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,530
...with my real sword skills!

202
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
Die!

203
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,040
Oni...

204
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,620
...Giri!

205
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,180
Cabaji!

206
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,720
We, the Buggy Pirates,

207
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,450
beaten by mere sneak thieves...

208
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,110
We ain't sneak thieves...

209
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,210
We're pirates!

210
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,800
Luffy! I'm goin' to sleep now!

211
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,520
Right! I'll handle the rest!

212
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,120
I'd expect no less from the
notorious Buggy Pirates' treasure...

213
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,760
Hauling it is exhausting!

214
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,660
But with this much treasure--!

215
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,590
Anyways, I gotta get
off this island ASAP!

216
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,170
You guys are pirates?!

217
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,180
Yeah! We're going to the Grand Line!

218
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,530
That's no simple voyage nameless
bums like you can handle, dimwit!

219
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,470
What're you gonna do in
the Grand Line, anyway?!

220
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,040
Go on a sightseeing trip or something?

221
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,680
Become King of the Pirates!

222
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,310
Get real, you flashy idiot!

223
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,300
You, King of the Pirates?!
Would that make me God, then?!

224
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,410
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates
and obtain this world's treasures!

225
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,450
Quit your dreaming!

226
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,020
You're annoying.

227
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,730
Just bring it on already!

228
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,320
Seeing that straw hat of yours
brings back memories of him...

229
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,990
...and irritates me!

230
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,170
Memories of that damn
cheeky red-haired man!

231
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,630
Red-haired?!

232
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,440
Red-haired...

233
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,260
Does that mean you know Shanks?!

234
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,440
Huh? Yeah, but why?

235
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
Where is he now?!

236
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,600
Dunno! Maybe I know where he is,

237
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,980
or maybe I don't!

238
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,690
What're you talking about?
Are you stupid or something?

239
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,270
Not as much as you!

240
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,480
I ain't nice enough of a guy to
just tell you what you wanna know!

241
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,110
Then I'll make you tell me!

242
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,820
I'll kill you before that ever happens!

243
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,170
I doubt rubber can
bounce back blades...

244
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,620
Nope, it can't!

245
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,500
Chop-Chop Rice Cracker!

246
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,130
Can't move in midair, can you?!

247
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,220
Can too!

248
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,770
Oh, quite interesting!

249
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,730
You, too!

250
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,190
Gum-Gum Pistol!

251
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,400
Those are interesting abilities,

252
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,740
but they leave you wide open!

253
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,820
I'm gonna carve you up!

254
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,240
Gum-Gum...

255
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,150
Chop-Chop Quick Escape!

256
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,000
...Sickle!

257
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,800
Not good enough, Gum-Gum!

258
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,400
Damn, you keep breaking into pieces!

259
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,870
W-What a fight...

260
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,890
It's almost like I'm dreaming...

261
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,900
H-Hey, you see that?!

262
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,170
You dumbass!
Keep pretending to be knocked out!

263
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,860
Get caught up in that, and you'd
never have enough lives to survive!

264
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,820
Chop-Chop Cannon!

265
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,820
Separate!

266
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,960
Well?! Now do you see, runt?!

267
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
You bastard!

268
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,770
Oh? Was I not supposed to
scratch your face or something?

269
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,420
How dare you...

270
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,810
How dare you damage this hat!

271
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,400
Huh?

272
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,770
This is my treasure!

273
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,810
Whoever damages this
hat absolutely must pay!

274
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,890
Yeah. I swore to the person
who gave me this straw hat...

275
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,240
...that I'd gather a crew
and become a pirate!

276
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,910
I thought there was nothing
that could faze him...

277
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,340
To think he could get this upset...

278
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,820
It would seem that
hat has a history to it.

279
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,330
That's right!

280
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,960
Is it that important of a hat?

281
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,390
If so...

282
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,020
...then protect it better!

283
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,840
Shanks!

284
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,240
Your arm!

285
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,680
I'll leave this hat with you.

286
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,250
It's dear to me.

287
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Take good care of it!

288
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,330
Come bring it back to me someday!

289
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,450
Once you've become a great pirate!

290
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,420
That's our promise, Luffy!

291
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,240
How is this old,
tattered hat a treasure?

292
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,730
Treasure refers to sparkly gold,
silver, and jewels...

293
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,010
...that display their owner's grandeur!

294
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,990
You call this filthy
straw hat a treasure?

295
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,650
Cut the crap!

296
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,990
That's the hat Shanks
and I swore over!

297
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,860
What?!

298
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,260
Meaning this is Shanks' hat?!

299
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,830
No wonder it seemed familiar!

300
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,280
He always wore this by my side!

301
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,880
You and Shanks sailed
on the same ship?!

302
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,700
Yeah, back when we
were pirates-in-training.

303
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,380
We were comrades.

304
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,720
That damn detestable,
red-haired bastard!

305
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,600
Shanks is a great man!

306
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,500
You, his comrade?!

307
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,720
Don't compare yourself to him!

308
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,090
Chop-Chop Quick Escape!

309
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,530
Hi, I'm Buggy!

310
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,330
Never say you and Shanks
are comrades ever again!

311
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,540
I can say whatever
I want about Shanks!

312
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,830
Tell me! What happened
between you and Shanks?

313
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,100
Damn it!

314
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
How dare you tear up my treasure!

315
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,730
Do you wanna know that badly?

316
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,990
He's the one person
I absolutely can't forgive!

317
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,110
I'll curse him for the rest of my life!

318
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,540
I'll never forgive him!

319
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:24,330
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

320
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:31,270
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

321
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:38,150
before someone else could
beat me to it

322
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:52,460
If the world is going to change

323
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,460
before I can even attain my dream

324
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:06,540
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

325
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:19,400
so that my memories won't fade

326
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,730
Get ready, Buggy!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

327
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,710
Yeah! Beat him!

328
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,560
You'll pay for damaging the hat
me and Shanks swore over!

329
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,160
Okay, get going, Luffy!
Beat him up to protect my treasure!

330
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,130
