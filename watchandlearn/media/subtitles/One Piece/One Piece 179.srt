00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,880
God's Island, Upper Yard...

18
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,980
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

19
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,310
In the Upper Ruins,
Zoro clashed against Priest Ohm.

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,050
Three-Sword Style!

21
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,800
One-hundred-eight Caliber Phoenix!

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,130
Luffy and the others were inside

23
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,250
the stomach of the giant snake,
who was playing with Wyper.

24
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,480
After finding the ruins
of Shandora, the city of gold,

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Nico Robin encountered God Eneru.

26
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,550
And Conis has come to know
God Eneru's horrifying secret.

27
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,090
Skypiea will be dropped into the Blue Sea!

28
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,560
This nation will disappear!!

29
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,200
Father!!

30
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,850
"Collapsing Upper Ruins!
The Quintet for the Finale!!"

31
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,740
Father...

32
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,010
Suu...

33
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,610
There's no time to lose!

34
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,400
Eneru is... Eneru is...

35
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,330
...planning to eliminate
everyone living in the sky!!

36
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,500
Skypiea will be dropped into the Blue Sea!

37
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,720
This nation will disappear!!

38
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,820
It's no time... to cry...

39
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,430
There's no time... to lose...

40
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,440
I have to do... what I can do!

41
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,570
I have to... let people know!

42
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,230
Take care of those two, Suu!

43
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,920
Because I have to go take
care of something...

44
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,550
I'll tell them at any cost!

45
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,600
I swear I'll give the message you
risked your life for to the islanders!

46
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,740
It took longer than I thought.

47
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,850
Does this mean that I
still need more training?

48
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,900
In any case, it's gotten quiet.

49
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,120
Wait!

50
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,960
Huh?

51
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,670
So this dog listens to anyone?!

52
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,210
Knock yourself unconscious!

53
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,150
Now I have to take care of
that snake and the bazooka guy.

54
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,360
I'd better hurry up!

55
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,140
There isn't time for a
long fight. Die already!

56
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,570
You're an eyesore! Why don't you just die?!

57
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,170
Tsk! To think that it isn't hurt
at all after taking so many hits...!

58
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,460
Sorry, but you'll have to die!

59
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,620
Even that didn't work?! Dammit!
Those are some hard scales!

60
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,990
Man...! What the hell is going on?!

61
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,280
What the hell are they doing
to the snake out there?!

62
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,990
Hey! Someone help! Hey!

63
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,970
Nami'd better still be alive!

64
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,880
Wh-What did you just do?!

65
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,840
I bestowed mercy.

66
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:27,340
A pitiful worm was in great pain, so I
saved him by releasing him from it.

67
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,560
It was my duty as God.

68
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,810
It seems that the young woman
is still behaving desperately,

69
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,700
but that's perfect
entertainment for the party.

70
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,580
They can all realize what despair is.

71
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,500
This man... has Logia Power!

72
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,050
Now, we are running out of time.

73
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,400
Let's settle this, shall we?

74
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,250
My ultimate plan will
start soon, as well, so...

75
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,060
Ultimate... plan?

76
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,980
God is calling you!

77
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,270
Come to me, lowly beings!!

78
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,310
Shango!!

79
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,280
What the...?!

80
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,090
What're you...?

81
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:48,430
I invited your friends here... to Shandora!!

82
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,810
This man's ability... What tremendous power!

83
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,540
The ground broke into pieces!

84
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,840
It's Eneru! He's the only one
who'd do something like this!

85
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,110
This isn't good, I've gotta...

86
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,170
Chopper!

87
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,560
What the hell...?! There's a hole below!

88
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,570
Let's start the finale!

89
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,460
I'll fly out of here.

90
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,270
Yeah! This could go on forever!

91
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,690
Luffy! Hold onto the waver!

92
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,560
I'm gonna fire up the engine!

93
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,980
Hey, you! Hold onto me!

94
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,430
Okay! I'm ready, Nami!

95
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,240
Here we go!

96
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,140
I can finally get out!

97
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,110
What?! What are they doing?!

98
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,210
Pierre, go back! We have to save those two!

99
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,610
H-Hey! Aren't we falling?!

100
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,830
Ahh! We are dropping fast!!

101
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,510
Pierre, don't worry about us.
Go help those two inside!

102
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,540
Wh-What're we gonna do, weird knight?!

103
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,760
If we don't do anything,
we'll crash into the ground!

104
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,620
My name is Gan Fall. It's Gan Fall!

105
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,860
Who cares about that right now?!

106
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,030
No!!

107
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,610
Ruins?

108
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,770
Why have this many pieces fallen from above?

109
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,580
Swordsman!

110
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,190
This is not my day!

111
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,850
Don't tell me you fell all the
way down here with these...

112
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,170
Dammit! I almost died!!

113
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,490
Yeah, that's what happens...
to normal people.

114
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,210
Oh, it's you.

115
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,330
Where am I?

116
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,030
It's the city of gold that
you were looking for.

117
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,090
I see. So this is the place.

118
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,600
It doesn't look much different
from the one that was up there.

119
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,350
So did you find the treasure?

120
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,060
No, there was no gold here.

121
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,210
Phew... This giant snake
went really crazy, didn't it?

122
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,880
We're back where we were!

123
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,590
Are you stupid?
Who'd hold onto the waver's jet?!

124
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,520
Sorry.

125
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,950
Everyone else made it outside!
We've been left behind! It's all your fault!

126
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,170
Don't worry!

127
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,980
What're you gonna do?

128
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,410
Well, why don't we hurry up
and plop out from its butthole?

129
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,630
I don't want to do that!

130
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,960
Oh, it's the horse!

131
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,260
That's a bird!

132
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,230
Huh? Are you saying to get on your back?

133
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,320
Ahh! The bird has become a horse!!

134
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,190
Ahh! Your hands stretched!!

135
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,440
I ate a Gum-Gum Fruit
and became a rubber person,

136
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,340
so of course I can stretch my arms!

137
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,050
Wh-What are you?!

138
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,710
A pirate! Now, let's go!

139
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,350
Hold on tight, okay?

140
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,660
Okay...

141
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,620
Alright! We'll break out this time for sure!

142
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,090
Go! Horse!!

143
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,500
Full speed ahead towards the exit!!

144
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,050
Ow, ow, ow...

145
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,930
Thanks, weird knight!

146
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,190
It was fortunate that we landed on clouds.

147
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,240
We left Luffy and Aisa behind.
I wonder if they're okay.

148
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:35,810
Trust Pierre. When push comes to shove,
he's a reliable bird, or horse...

149
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,970
Say, where on earth are we?

150
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,900
It seems underground, location-wise...

151
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,000
...but I have never seen
this place. Where on earth...?

152
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,130
Thanks.

153
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,600
In any case, to think that there
was a place like this in Upper Yard...

154
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,130
Is it possible... that this place is...

155
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,550
...the homeland of the Shandians?!

156
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,850
Light the fire of Shandora!

157
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,720
In the name of the Great Warrior Calgara!

158
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,510
Light the fire of Shandora!!

159
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,230
We're going back!

160
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,760
To our homeland!

161
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,410
To our homeland!!

162
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,130
So this is the place that we've been seeking!

163
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,910
The proud city that our ancestors protected!

164
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,200
Shandora!!

165
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,050
It looks like it's looking for something...

166
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,050
...or maybe Luffy's doing
something inside again?

167
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,760
The giant snake is acting strange.

168
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,940
It's crying!

169
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,850
What's the meaning of this, Lord of the Sky?

170
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,540
What are you so worked up for?

171
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,750
What an annoying snake!

172
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,450
How foolish...!

173
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,380
El Thor!

174
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,300
Aisa!

175
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,340
Dammit! Nami!

176
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,100
She won't survive that!

177
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,600
Oh? Zoro! Robin, too!

178
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,550
You were there?! When did you
get out of that snake's stomach?!

179
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,980
Why are you here, Navigator?

180
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,740
Well, I'm all right... but...

181
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,360
...Luffy's in there.

182
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,300
Huh? Why in the hell is he...?!

183
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,710
What was I supposed to do?! He was in there!

184
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,630
Geez...! Such a pain in the ass!
Why's he always like this?!

185
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,160
How should I know?!

186
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,900
With just one hit...

187
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,430
...when the Lord of the Sky wasn't hurt
at all after so many bazooka attacks.

188
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,850
Dammit! This may have hurt Aisa inside!

189
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,590
Ball Clouds!

190
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,590
Eneru!

191
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,000
What was that for? That wasn't
very nice of you, Warrior Wyper.

192
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,180
I kindly invited you to
your homeland, you know.

193
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,940
Don't get so fired up. Wait a little.

194
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,300
The game isn't over yet.

195
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,030
Game, you said?!

196
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,740
That's right. It's a petty game.

197
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,110
You... and those behind you
as well, are the participants.

198
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,000
Welcome, splendid survivors!

199
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,350
I'm glad you made it this far.
I'll praise you for that.

200
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,820
Well, I'm just having a little fun.

201
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,190
This is a survival game to see
how many people out of 81,

202
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:30,970
including me, are standing three
hours after you all entered this island.

203
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,090
There're participants who entered
in the middle of the game,

204
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,180
but I'm allowing that as well.

205
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,880
My guess was that there'd be five survivors.

206
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,370
Five?!

207
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,320
Zoro, Robin, weird knight,
bazooka man, and Eneru.

208
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,380
That's exactly five people, right?

209
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,250
Phew. Good, he hasn't noticed I'm here.

210
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,610
In three minutes, it'll be three hours.

211
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,560
In other words, it won't do if
there're six people here right now.

212
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,470
Doh! He knew!

213
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,910
God's prophecy cannot fail,
since he is absolute.

214
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,190
Now, who will die? Will you fight each other?

215
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,460
Or shall I take care of it myself?

216
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,220
What do you wanna do?

217
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,830
I'm not going to be the one.

218
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,980
Me neither.

219
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,070
I won't accept that, either.

220
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,190
I, too, firmly refuse.

221
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,390
Hey, hold on a sec! I...!

222
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,340
So you die!

223
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,950
How insolent!

224
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,810
Racing full speed ahead as always

225
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,560
A to Z, we run through it

226
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,360
We all have worries and fall many times

227
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,280
But we just need to rise to the top someday

228
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:31,750
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

229
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,810
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

230
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,310
I never treat you "bad"

231
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,010
How many times did we fall?

232
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:55,100
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

233
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Smile! Come back to you, friends

234
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,450
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

235
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,370
Come back to you, friends

236
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,210
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

237
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,910
Come back to you, friends

238
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,810
What's gonna happen to us?!

239
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,680
Dangerous... That guy's dangerous!

240
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,780
Only survivors are allowed to come with me.

241
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,620
Are you messed up in the head?!

242
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,750
I won't let you have your way, Eneru!

243
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,300
Now, let's set off, shall we?
To the Endless Vearth!

244
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,680
On the next episode of One Piece!

245
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,740
"Showdown in the Ancient Ruins!
Sky God Eneru's Goal!!"

246
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
