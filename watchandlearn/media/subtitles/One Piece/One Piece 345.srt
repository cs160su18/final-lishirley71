2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,720
My eyes follow the beautiful ladies.

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,760
But I'm a mummy, so I don't have eyes!

49
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,600
May I see your panties?

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,770
No way!

51
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,070
This exchange...!

52
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,860
He repeated him word for word...

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,700
There is nowhere to run!

54
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,480
Cindry-san, would you be so kind
as to open yonder passage?

55
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,060
Also, I would like a midnight snack.

56
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,440
Wh-What gives? I thought
he was going to attack us.

57
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,440
That scared me. What's he up to?

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,200
I-It doesn't matter!
C'mon, let's make a break for it!

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,360
The door is wide open!

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,490
--You're right!
--Y-Yeah!

61
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,920
Three-Pace Hum... Notch Slash!

62
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,240
They must have done
something during the fray.

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,720
We've lost a valuable man.

64
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,300
Cool it!

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,890
Yeah, but... He's right. Sanji'll be okay.

66
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,310
Go! Go!

67
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,550
Go and learn just how
terrifying our master truly is!

68
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,940
Our real boss is one of the Seven
Warlords of the Sea, Gecko Mori--

69
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,910
Ah! I can't say his name!
It's too terrifying!

70
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,580
Merely saying his name
sends chills down my spine!

71
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,290
Your missing crewmates
won't come back unscathed...

72
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,840
You'll lose one pal after the next...!

73
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,260
You will regret coming here!

74
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,050
Before the Seven Warlord's Gecko--

75
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,010
no, before my master's true power,

76
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,890
all of you will taste fear!

77
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,510
You sure love to ramble on and on!

78
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,270
Then pass this message on to that jerk Moria!

79
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,470
"If anything happens to my crew...

80
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,370
...I'll send you and this
entire island flying!"

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,110
Awaken, General Zombies!

82
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,810
Arise, ancient warriors!

83
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,300
Now go, my courageous General Zombies!

84
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,290
"A Bunch of Animals?
Perona's Wonder Garden!"

85
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,210
I don't care what part of
the mansion they enter!

86
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,040
Hunt them down and haul them in!

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,630
They're nothing before you, General Zombies!

88
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,140
Hey! Don't drag your feet, Captain John.

89
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,180
You're crushing the name
you made notorious in life!

90
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,890
Yeah, yeah. I'm goin'.

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,060
Sheesh! He's such a scallywag.

92
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,110
Ab-sama, marry me!

93
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,170
Lola! Sow, hurry off to battle!
I'm your commanding officer!

94
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,300
Then marry me.

95
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,740
Why should I?!

96
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,700
W-Wait, Lola! What are you doing?

97
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,630
Sow! Are you ignoring a direct order
from Absalom of the Grave?!

98
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,330
I'll listen if you marry me!

99
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,340
Don't be stupid! I'm human!
I'm going to marry a human woman!

100
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Come on, Lola! Just think for a second.

101
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,930
You're not only a warthog,
you're also a zombie!

102
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,020
You're dead and rotting!

103
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
Cut that out!

104
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,190
Yikes, what a terrifying stunt!

105
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,450
That's a marriage registration form!

106
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,700
Stop trying to make us an
officially married couple!

107
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,370
Aw, I just love your wild mouth!

108
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,040
Absalom, give me your finger! I love you!

109
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,090
Screw that!

110
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,420
I'll never spend the rest of
my life with a dead animal!

111
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,590
Bride Fu! Vow Kiss!

112
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,070
Smooch! Smooch! Smooth! Smooch!

113
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,140
Smooch! Smooch!

114
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,890
Wife Fu! Vow Hug!

115
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,270
I love you to death!

116
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,020
B-But you died a long time ago!

117
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,360
Even if I'm a rotting zombie,
my love for you will never die!

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,730
Marry me!

119
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,110
But like I said, I--

120
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,700
This finger is mine!

121
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,750
I'm not about to let you
escape, bastard! I love you!

122
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,300
Bride Fu! Vow of My Love Attack!

123
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,340
Give it up!

124
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,880
Hiya!

125
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,060
Wait, Lola! Listen carefully, sow!

126
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,770
I have already... picked out the
woman who is soon to be my bride!

127
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,730
She seems strong-willed,
but also has a sense of grace.

128
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,110
She's a frail, human woman!

129
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,990
It'll fall through like always.

130
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,820
Look at this, fool! She is one of the
pirates who disembarked on this island.

131
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,530
She is beautiful! This one
is worthy to be my bride!

132
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,530
I won't let that happen! That woman...

133
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,620
...is going down!

134
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,670
Don't kill her! Hold up, Lola!

135
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,300
That old zombie wannabe said that
Gecko Moria's had his eyes on us

136
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,310
ever since we were invited to this island.

137
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,520
Perhaps the curly cook's disappearance
has something to do with Moria.

138
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,310
That stupid cook! He had it coming.

139
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,990
But I never expected to run into
one of the Seven Warlords here.

140
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,820
Why would a pirate want
to steal people's shadows?

141
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,530
I would love to know!

142
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,700
I-I don't know anything!

143
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,790
I promised that geezer I'd kick Moria's butt,

144
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,640
but that'll have to go on hold.

145
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,130
Your missing friends are
already screwed anyway!

146
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,420
In fact, you're in no position
to be worrying about others!

147
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,510
Not anymore...

148
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,060
Quit oinking and lead the way,
you stupid piggy!

149
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,270
Oink!

150
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,030
What's wrong?

151
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,220
Nothing. It must be my imagination.

152
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,420
Hey, Kumacy! Kumacy!

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,960
The Risky Brothers are
carrying the casket over.

154
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,550
Get it from them and take the
casket to Master's dance hall.

155
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,260
Got that?

156
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,190
Did you get that or not?!

157
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,620
--Ye...
--Don't answer! You're so not cute!

158
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,560
I'll be directing the Treasure
Retrieval Party on the ship,

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,230
so come get me if anything happens.
Do you understand?

160
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,860
That's right! You're cute
as long as you're quiet!

161
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,240
Take care...

162
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,120
Punk! You just whispered something!

163
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,510
Delivery! Delivery for Master!

164
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,720
Chirp, chirp, chirp!

165
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,970
Oh, no! Now we've really done it!

166
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,980
Oh, no! We tripped! There goes
our delivery to Master...!

167
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,370
The casket popped open!

168
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,440
Huh? Where is this?

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,400
He's up! Crap! Hurry and whack him!
Whack him to death!

170
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,450
We can't kill him.

171
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,660
Then beat him within an inch of his life!

172
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,950
Jerks!

173
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,870
Usopp! Nami!

174
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,840
Hey, hang in there! Wake up!

175
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,010
Ow, ow, ow...

176
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,470
Huh? But didn't... that samurai attack us...?

177
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,640
Did he hit us with the
blunt side of his sword?

178
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
It looks like it must have rained a bit.

179
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,860
The ground is wet. Where is this?

180
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,810
I'm not sure, but those
squirrels were carrying us.

181
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,360
That's a freaking casket!

182
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,120
Crap! All three of them are up now.

183
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Not good! Let's call for backup.

184
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,840
This looks like it's in
the back of the mansion.

185
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,050
Hogback's lab was on that top floor,

186
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,050
so they carried us a pretty good distance.

187
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,760
H-Hey, look behind you!

188
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,210
There is a sturdier building
on the opposite side.

189
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,730
What's that?

190
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,940
"Evil Be Gone"

191
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,530
Do you remember seeing
a huge building behind the mansion?

192
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,250
Usopp! Chopper!

193
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,660
I figured out what this
area is supposed to be.

194
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,510
What is it? What's the deal with this place?

195
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,710
This is the breezeway that connects
the mansion to that building.

196
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,040
A breezeway? It's way too big for that!

197
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,960
"Evil Be Gone"

198
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,500
They've practically stuffed a forest in here.

199
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,050
Well, it'd make for one weird forest.

200
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,930
But for them to have carried us
here while we were out cold,

201
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,890
isn't it safe to assume they
were taking us to that building?

202
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,170
If they succeeded, they might
have turned us into zombies.

203
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,850
I'm glad I came to! Let's run for it!

204
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,820
Yeah! Let's blow this popsicle stand.

205
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,730
Hold your horses.

206
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,780
"Evil Be Gone"

207
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,150
This isn't adding up.

208
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,660
We've been terrified right and left,

209
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,660
screamed our heads off and run like mad...

210
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,710
--All for free?
--What are you going on about?!

211
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,330
I'm getting a strong reading on
my Something's Fishy Sensor!

212
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,420
Don't say anything! Let's just
make a break for it, Nami!

213
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,280
Right! You heard him!

214
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,540
--Back in that room,
--Let's run for it!

215
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,840
--I'm pretty sure that zombie said...
--Let's get out of here, Nami!

216
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,630
Sorry! This isn't where
we store the treasure!

217
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,140
Don't get any crazy ideas!
We're running for it!

218
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Let's get out of here, Nami!

219
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,980
You're so stupid!
I know, sheesh! I'm scared, too.

220
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,600
But your eyes look funny!

221
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,390
Then which way would you like to run?
Forward? Backwards?

222
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,990
That's a toughie...

223
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,160
I don't wanna go back to the mansion
and run into that samurai again.

224
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,920
But if we push forward, I bet there
are even scarier people lying in wait.

225
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,710
Eh? What are those
adorable animals? Penguins?

226
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,000
Number 1!

227
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,380
2!

228
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,130
3!

229
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,090
Ew...

230
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,010
Hello! We're the...

231
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,140
...Penguin Zombie Duo!

232
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,560
Oops, I goofed up.

233
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,100
Trio! We're a trio! I'm a new member.

234
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,640
Like I care about what's
going on with your members!

235
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,010
And the guys standing behind you are...

236
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,480
--Behind us?
--...our friends, the Wild Zombies!

237
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,780
Welcome to Perona-sama's Wonder Garden!

238
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,040
There is a disturbing number
of super freaky critters!

239
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,150
Go! Beat the living daylights out of them!

240
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Chopper!

241
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,780
Nami! Usopp! I'll hold them back.

242
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,870
No matter where we go,
weird zombies are bound to show up!

243
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,670
And these guys are animals!
I bet they're faster runners than us!

244
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,460
The punk! He may look like
a human, but he's an animal.

245
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,420
Right! I'm a reindeer.

246
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,800
So you're a Zoan-type power holder?

247
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,050
We're fellow animals here!

248
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,140
If you quietly do as we ask,
we won't get rough with you.

249
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,140
We aren't "fellow animals"!

250
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,060
Really? Then we won't hold back.

251
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,070
Nami, you should go hide!

252
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,150
O-Okay!

253
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,610
Beat it! Ouch!

254
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,910
Wh-What? You wanna fight?

255
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,120
Dumb zebra-like kangaroo!
Or are you a kangaroo-like zebra...?

256
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,920
Not that it matters!

257
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,380
I-I should warn you about something!

258
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,970
I'm the invincible reigning champion

259
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,060
of 50 World Pirate Boxing
Tournaments straight!

260
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,020
Behold! I don't have a single opening!

261
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,520
You can attack from any direction you want!

262
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,610
Eat my Elusive Right!

263
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,910
Y-You're pretty good, aren't ya?

264
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,500
Your game of hide-and-seek is over!

265
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,330
Don't underestimate a dog's sense of smell.

266
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,040
Dogs shouldn't talk!

267
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,260
No!

268
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,260
Eek, here he comes!

269
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,430
Oh, crap!

270
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,770
Sweet! That was a smart play!

271
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,070
Shoot!

272
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,030
I'm sorry!

273
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,530
No!

274
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,910
--Over here!
--Whoa, whoa, whoa!

275
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,090
Yay!

276
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,100
--Yay!
--Yay...!

277
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
H-Hey! I'm falling!

278
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,710
Gosh darn, that was close!

279
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,470
Hey! I dare you to come over here if you can!

280
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,180
Neener-neener, boo-boo!

281
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,970
You can kiss my shiny little hiney!

282
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,180
Eat fart!

283
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,610
Stay back! Stay back!

284
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,860
Fwoosh!

285
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,330
Waah! It's persistent!

286
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,950
I've got it!

287
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,080
Take this!

288
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,580
Whatcha think? Did you see how the
great Usopp-sama is a master sniper?

289
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,140
Wait! Wait!

290
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,070
Damn it! As things stand,
there are just too many of them.

291
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,200
Usopp! Nami!

292
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,500
Chopper!

293
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

294
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,670
Hey, Nami! What were you...

295
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,880
Usopp, fire!

296
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Fire?!

297
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,300
We need fire! These are also zombies.

298
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,210
Hey, save me! They're about to bite me!

299
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,430
Nami!

300
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,970
Crap! Let go of me! Stay back!

301
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,680
Zombies are weak against...

302
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,850
Special Attack! Flame Star!

303
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,070
--Fire!
--That's rottin' bad!

304
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,820
That worked better than I could have hoped!

305
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,740
Take this, you darn bear rug!

306
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,990
Crap! It's a candle!

307
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,000
It's hot! It's rottin' hot!

308
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,040
Fire! It's terrifying!

309
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,120
Put it out!

310
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,170
Crap! He climbed up the chandelier!

311
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,840
Someone knock him back down!

312
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
Eat this!

313
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,670
Darn you!

314
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,670
That's right! I had that ace up my sleeve!

315
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,970
Special Attack! Flame Star!

316
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,890
And how about one more?

317
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,030
Usopp!

318
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,150
Chopper, look out! Behind you!

319
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,820
Usopp! Chopper!

320
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,500
You're in danger as well.

321
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,370
Don't hurt her!

322
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,470
Bastard! Why'd you attack an ally?

323
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,010
That woman is the enemy!
You're supposed to kick her butt!

324
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,890
I don't know who this lady is,

325
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,900
but even if it means
defying the master's orders

326
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,860
or sacrificing myself, I won't kick a woman!

327
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,140
If you have a problem with that, you can
take it up with me, stinky zombies!

328
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,410
Huh?

329
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,900
Hey! What happened?!

330
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,020
Hey, Oinker! Did you pull another
fast one on us? Out with it!

331
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,400
Haven't I been telling
you that I'm in the dark?

332
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,060
Don't laugh! It gives the
impression that you're lying.

333
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,080
How strange. I wonder if he was
strangled so he couldn't utter a sound.

334
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,530
Why were your circuits
wired to be so ominous?!

335
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,690
This is so weird! Now Zoro's missing.

336
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,300
What's goin' on?! People keep
vanishin' one after the next!

337
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,680
First one person vanishes,
then a second, a third and a fourth...!

338
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,470
Does that mean we're next?

339
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,150
And then no one was left.

340
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,310
No one was left.

341
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,690
The stuff you say is freakin' ominous!

342
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

343
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,630
"The Vanishing Straw Hat Crew!
A Mysterious Swordsman Appears!"

344
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
