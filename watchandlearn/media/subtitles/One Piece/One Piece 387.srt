00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered
just before his death

6
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

7
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,200
My treasure?

8
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,470
If you want it, you can have it!

9
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,820
Find it!

10
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

11
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,260
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,730
As Luffy and his friends continued their
voyage in search of Fishman Island,

14
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,560
they made it halfway to the Grand Line.

15
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,940
Chopper!

16
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,990
Coup de Burst!

17
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,370
I can't see the top...

18
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,330
It's huge!

19
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,420
They finally reached the Red Line.

20
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,600
There, they met the mermaid Camie

21
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,890
and the starfish Pappug, and became friends.

22
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,100
Thanks for saving me.

23
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,610
Camie, you're okay?

24
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,840
Camie asked them to save her
imprisoned friend, "Hatchin,"

25
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,570
so they headed toward the hideout of the
kidnapping gang, the Flying Fish Riders.

26
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,760
What? What's going on?

27
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,870
There they are! The Flying Fish Riders!

28
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,510
Hey! Did you see?

29
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,510
Yeah! There's no mistake!
It's the Straw Hats!

30
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,160
I've been waiting. I've been waiting so long.

31
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,150
That pirate ship is the
one I've been waiting for.

32
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,270
I'll kill him.

33
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,610
I'll kill the man who ruined my life!

34
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,000
"The Fated Reunion! Save
the Imprisoned Fishman!"

35
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,140
The flying fish left.

36
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,160
They were obviously taking
the offensive, though.

37
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,640
It looked like they received
some kind of message.

38
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,310
Maybe they were ordered to retreat?

39
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,600
Though I don't know why...

40
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,650
I wanna ride one!

41
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,050
Those flying fish can fly
for five whole minutes?!

42
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,350
That's so cool!

43
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,730
Anyway, those flying fish will be at
the place we're heading for, right?

44
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,260
Then we'll need to be prepared to fight.

45
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,160
I never expected them to
come from the sky, though...

46
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,760
Why don't we bring the cannons up on deck?

47
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,980
Then I can shoot 'em out of the sky!

48
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,750
All right!

49
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,480
I hope Hatchin is okay...

50
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,640
You're the one Macro is really after.

51
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,740
You should be careful yourself.

52
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,400
You're right.

53
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,760
Duval-sama! The three Riders have returned!

54
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,490
Duval-sama, why did you order us back?

55
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,700
Yeah!

56
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,010
If you'd left it to us, we could've
nabbed the mermaid and the pirates!

57
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,160
Fools!

58
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,630
You guys...

59
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,630
Yes, sir!

60
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,710
Do you know how I have felt
as I waited for those pirates?

61
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,020
I'm sure you know the story.

62
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,010
Duval

63
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,190
When I think about that man,

64
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,490
the huge wound on my back throbs terribly.

65
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,360
Uh-oh... The Head is mad!

66
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:21,000
Day after day, I have continued
to loathe that man...

67
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,320
Head, please calm down...

68
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,430
Shall I kill him here today?

69
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,470
What do you think?

70
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,260
That is the biggest question in my life!

71
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,400
Do you realize that?!

72
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Y-Yes! In that case, you
should not let him live!

73
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,020
That's exactly why I must be careful
and thorough in eliminating him.

74
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,570
So do as I tell you!

75
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,280
Yes, Head!

76
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Hey, Macro Pirates.

77
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Yeah? You called?

78
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,240
What is it, Duva?

79
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,180
Gyaro, how could you call him Duva?!

80
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,920
And Tansui, "Yeah?" isn't right!

81
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,880
You're both being rude!

82
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,270
Ha, ha. "Duva" sounds funny.

83
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,140
Oh, damn it!

84
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,070
Hey, Master Duval! Hey,
hey, you called for us?

85
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,890
Boss, he's too worked up.

86
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,470
Quiet! Shut your mouth!

87
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,550
I'm so sorry, Master.

88
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,690
They truly are idiots. They don't
know how to speak properly.

89
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,850
That's fine, boys.

90
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,030
To me, you're like messengers from
heaven who bring me happiness.

91
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,020
I'm so grateful, I can't
find the words to thank you.

92
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,450
S'okay.

93
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,270
I told you to shut up, Tansui!

94
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,300
Thanks to you boys, I'll
finally... finally... meet them.

95
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:54,220
I'll finally meet the Straw Hats!

96
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,680
Straw Hats? Huh? Who are they?

97
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,430
The Straw Hats... So I
didn't hear that wrong.

98
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,370
The man...

99
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,690
...I have been praying...

100
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,050
...for a chance to kill is on that ship!

101
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,060
I will never forgive him!

102
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,660
Head, please calm down!

103
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,120
That's quite a grudge you're carrying.

104
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,460
I never expected to hear the
Straw Hats spoken of here...

105
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,010
Hey, you! Big guy!

106
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,250
Gah! This is Duval-sama, you damn octopus!

107
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,510
Was Camie captured by the Straw Hats?

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,880
This is bad... Of all people, why them?

109
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,930
Are they coming here?

110
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,380
That's right. They're headed here.

111
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,140
Hey, does that mean your mermaid
went to pirates for help?

112
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,990
I don't know the details, but
she didn't seem like a prisoner.

113
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,830
Well, no matter who she brings,

114
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:03,040
as long as we're here, they'll all be
captured and sold at the human shop.

115
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,880
As if that's possible! Those
guys are crazy strong!

116
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,620
Man, this is a problem... Nami's
probably with them, too...

117
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,980
She's probably holding a grudge against me.

118
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,090
Of course she would.

119
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,520
I did awful things to her
with Arlong and the boys.

120
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,550
I've gotta get out of
here before they arrive,

121
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,930
or they're sure to pulverize me.

122
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,610
This is a huge problem!

123
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,380
That's...

124
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,740
Duval-sama!

125
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,500
It's the Straw Hats!

126
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,210
Finally... they're here...

127
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,840
Hey, Macro.

128
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Huh? What do you want?

129
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,810
I'll give you takoyaki, so please let me go.

130
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,970
I'm not letting you go, idiot! You
think I'm that obsessed with food?!

131
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,280
Are you sure he's on the ship?

132
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,230
Yes! He's definitely there!

133
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,420
It's curtains for you
now. I hope you're ready!

134
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,310
Hey, Gyaro, I'll give you
takoyaki, so please let me go.

135
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,240
Who do you think is gonna fall for—

136
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,620
Hey! Just how obsessed with food are you?!

137
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,580
All of you, get in position!

138
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,840
Yes, sir!

139
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,860
Hey, Tansui, I'll give you— Huh?

140
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,670
Shut up! You come with us!

141
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,260
Hey, I see something!

142
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,970
Looks like that's the Flying
Fish Riders' hideout.

143
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,220
So that's where this
Hatchin guy is imprisoned?

144
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,730
Hatchin...

145
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,390
Hey! Let's hurry up and save the takoyaki!

146
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,930
We know! Just hold on!

147
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,230
We'll save him in a flash, Camie-chan!

148
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,850
Thanks, Sanji-chin!

149
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,890
Oh, but be careful, everyone!

150
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:14,020
The Macro Pirates alone
have captured me 30 times!

151
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,880
You get captured too much!

152
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,120
Well...

153
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
And eaten too much, too!

154
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,350
Looks like we've entered their territory.

155
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,060
Ugh, there's that "we shouldn't go
to this island" syndrome again...

156
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,880
This isn't an island.

157
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,950
It's more like a living
complex built on the sea.

158
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,030
My "we shouldn't go to this living
complex built on the sea" syndrome!

159
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,940
Why would they go to the
trouble to live here?

160
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,030
Who knows?

161
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,750
Sure is quiet, though.

162
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,170
I have a bad feeling...

163
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,710
Luffy! We should...

164
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,920
...go forward!

165
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,010
Hey! Come up with a plan or something!

166
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:12,020
Hey! Hatchin! Are you okay?!

167
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,480
Get out here, Macro!

168
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,350
Give Hachi back!

169
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,860
Oh, no! It really is the Straw Hats' ship!

170
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,040
Damn!

171
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,930
Nope, I can't get out...

172
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,220
Then I'll have to..

173
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,830
Takohachi Black!

174
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,260
There's someone in that cage.

175
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,870
What is that black thing?

176
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,650
What?! Let me see!

177
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,730
Could that be Hatchin?

178
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,160
We've got this, Camie! There
are no enemies around!

179
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,510
It must be their snack time!

180
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,070
Yeah!

181
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,610
Are you being serious?!

182
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,330
No matter how you look at it, that's a trap!

183
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,960
They're all hiding nearby
and keeping an eye on us.

184
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,290
What incredible insight!

185
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,020
I-I never thought of that!

186
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,920
That's why you keep getting caught!

187
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,180
I'm right here! Camie, I'm
all right, so don't worry!

188
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,920
I knew it! Hatchin!

189
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,770
You're all black! What happened?!

190
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,690
Well... I had my own reasons.

191
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,140
More importantly, this is a
trap! You have to turn back!

192
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,830
You know I'm strong, right?
I'll be fine, so go!

193
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,350
That same voice, and that
unusual silhouette...

194
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,010
What do you think, Nami?

195
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,710
I suspect... In fact, I'm almost sure...

196
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,800
Sure of what?

197
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,970
We could always ask him and find out.

198
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,930
Hey! How's Arlong doing?

199
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,970
Oh, Arlong-san?

200
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,590
Well, he and Chew and Kuroobi
were all captured by the Navy!

201
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,870
I was the only one to break out,

202
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,970
and now I'm running a takoyaki shop
like I always dreamed of doing.

203
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,970
Arlong?

204
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,240
I knew it...

205
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,040
It's you, octopus?!

206
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
Crap!

207
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,360
C-Crap!

208
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,950
You're that octopus from Arlong's crew!

209
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,740
So you're the takoyaki maker called Hatchin?!

210
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,530
What?

211
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,240
Well, some stuff happened...

212
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,180
Nami's hometown was controlled by a fishman

213
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,980
pirate gang called the Arlong Pirates.

214
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,250
They put Nami through all
kinds of terrible stuff.

215
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,170
That octopus used to be
an officer in their gang.

216
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,600
Nami, are you thinking of running away?

217
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:45,110
If you do that, everyone in Cocoyashi
Village will be killed on your account.

218
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,570
Which one of you is Arlong?

219
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,080
Huh... So he's a known enemy?

220
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,360
Well, naturally, I took Luffy
and the others there to

221
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,970
bust some heads, and the
whole gang was annihilated!

222
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,420
Wow! You're amazing, Usopp!

223
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,930
Y-Yeah, well...

224
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,230
I thought all of those fishmen
were dragged off by the navy...

225
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,890
But it looks like he escaped by himself.

226
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,430
I see. Every man has a history.

227
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,710
Hey, you octopus!

228
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,770
Now that we know it's you,
there's no way we're saving you!

229
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,010
B-But...

230
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,290
I-I-Is...

231
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,750
Is your takoyaki really that good?!

232
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,170
Don't waver between your
reason and your appetite.

233
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,130
This is stupid.

234
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,530
You mean...

235
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,550
You know Hatchin?

236
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,630
Were you friends with him before?

237
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,500
We were not friends!

238
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,890
Turn the ship around!

239
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
Nami-chin...

240
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,880
I'm sorry, Camie.

241
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,610
I wasn't expecting your friend to be him.

242
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,880
No...

243
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,360
Then you won't help me rescue him?

244
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,220
Hatchin!

245
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,870
Camie, that's fine! You should
leave! This is a trap!

246
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,630
No way!

247
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,070
I will save you!

248
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,290
You always save us, Hachi!

249
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,540
Pappug!

250
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,380
Right!

251
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,230
I had no idea these people were so heartless!

252
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,010
Stupid! Stupid!

253
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,220
Shut up!

254
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Just wait, Hatchin!

255
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,290
I'll never abandon you, Hatchin!

256
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,500
Here we go!

257
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,120
Camie-chan!

258
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,400
That idiot.

259
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,030
Will they be okay?

260
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,200
Given all that stuff they said,
they must have some kind of plan.

261
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,490
I've got you, Camie!

262
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,910
You guys are the definition of "all talk"!

263
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,260
Now we're gonna be rich!

264
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,950
Look what happened to Hachi after
he always came to save you!

265
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,460
You're not gonna get away, Camie!

266
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,070
I told you!

267
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,330
Camie! Pappug!

268
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,630
Bastards!

269
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,720
Camie-chan did nothing wrong!

270
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,430
Wait, Sanji-kun!

271
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,650
I'm coming to save you, Camie!

272
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,330
It's okay. We'll set Hachi free, too.

273
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,530
What?

274
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,960
Hachi's all right. He's actually harmless.

275
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,680
Besides...

276
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,990
This isn't what we promised Camie.

277
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,590
N-Nami-san...

278
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,550
That strong-willed attitude
of yours is beautiful!

279
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,800
Hey, Nami!

280
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,970
You sure?

281
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

282
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,190
Luffy!

283
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,720
If it's okay with you, we have no choice.

284
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,230
We'll save the octopus, too.

285
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,850
Hey! Your eyes are takoyaki!

286
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,470
Are you ready,

287
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,640
Flying Fish Riders?

288
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,110
Of course! Anytime!

289
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,440
Gum-Gum...

290
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,630
Pistol!

291
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,700
And one more!

292
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,610
He has powers?!

293
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,700
A Straw Hat?!

294
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,210
That bastard!

295
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,250
Luffy-chin!

296
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,460
You did it!

297
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,710
All right! I got 'em back!

298
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,680
Thank you, Straw Hat! I owe you one!

299
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,970
Zoro! Cut the rope holding up the cage!

300
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,930
Got it!

301
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,810
Straw Hat! Be careful!

302
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,490
You're right in their trap!

303
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,280
The Flying Fish Riders have
you surrounded from the air!

304
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,860
Get them!

305
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,700
Yes, sir!

306
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,910
Luffy-chin!

307
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,750
Whether it's from the sea
or the sky, bring it on!

308
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,130
I'll go nuts on 'em!

309
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,420
Boys!

310
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,630
It's battle time!

311
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,780
Yeah!

312
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,690
Damn it! We'll have to move while we can!

313
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,860
Get Camie back!

314
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,490
Yeah!

315
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,510
Camie! Pappug! It's dangerous, so stay back!

316
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,290
Huh?

317
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,210
Stretch! You can do it, Luffy-chin!

318
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,210
Go! Go!

319
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,360
Come on, flying fish!

320
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,000
Go! Go!

321
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,260
They're coming!

322
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,260
Right!

323
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,250
I found you, "Black Foot" Sanji!

324
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,220
Does he know you, Sanji?

325
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,300
That man ruined my life!

326
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,970
He really has it in for you.

327
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,330
Go to hell!

328
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,850
What did you do, Sanji?!

329
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,360
