00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,000
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,800
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,160
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,400
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,430
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,050
Tempest Kick! Lotus!

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,280
Take this! Song of Willow!

36
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,150
Wh-What the hell...

37
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,970
...is this?!

38
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,670
A voice...?

39
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,490
Hm?

40
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,630
Hey, hurry up!

41
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,590
Why are you stopping, Nico Robin?!

42
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,310
Hey, are you listening, you woman
whose very life is a crime?!

43
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,980
Hey, Lucci! Drag her along!

44
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,140
Grab her by her hair!

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,530
It's an order.

46
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,320
Get moving, Nico Robin.

47
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,420
Don't tell me... you still think that the
Straw Hats are coming to your rescue?

48
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,620
How stupid!

49
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,090
Are you seriously still laying your
hopes on such weak-looking pirates?

50
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,470
The only feeling you'll have is a sense of guilt.

51
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,880
You'll endlessly atone for your
sin of having lived until today.

52
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,010
Right, Nico Robin?

53
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,420
Robin!

54
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,040
Wh-Wh-What was that?! I just heard a voice!

55
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,600
Hey! What was that voice?!

56
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,200
Hm? The space has opened up. Where am I?

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
There you are! Pigeon guy!

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,380
"Resounding Bad News! Buster Call Invoked!"

59
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,970
I'm impressed... I'll say that much.

60
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,440
To think that you've come
this far... all by yourself.

61
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,440
I didn't come by myself!

62
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,940
Hm?

63
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,380
There's no way I could come this far by myself,

64
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,530
and I wouldn't even wanna come by myself.

65
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,410
Unlike you guys, I'm not alone!

66
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,350
Soon all my friends will come here!

67
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,680
Tempest Kick!

68
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,190
Shave!

69
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,420
I'm really starting to get the hang of this.

70
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm starting to feel kinda sick.

71
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,590
You're a sailor. Don't say
pathetic things like that!

72
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,690
I-I'm not a sailor. I'm a hero who
hails from the island of snipers...

73
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,960
...although my best friend
Usopp-kun is a sailor.

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,130
Stop talking nonsense. Here.

75
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,380
They dodged!

76
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,420
Th-Th-That was close!

77
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,540
Don't let your guard down!

78
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,840
O-Okay.

79
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,680
And don't do things that are uncalled for!

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,390
O-Okay.

81
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,200
Hm?! What's that supposed
to mean?! How rude!

82
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,950
You sure are rude!

83
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,390
This is no good... It's so
slippery that I can't stand.

84
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,570
Even still...

85
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,330
...what a creepy power.

86
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,340
That sounds like a bunch of sour grapes.

87
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,290
Since you don't come close to me
when it comes to strength and beauty...

88
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,090
...I gave you the gift of silky skin

89
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,760
so that you can at least come
a bit closer to my beauty.

90
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,260
You should appreciate it.

91
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,760
That's very sweet of you. But...

92
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,560
...there's a limit to how far you
can go, right?! There's a limit!

93
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Is there a limit to women's desire?

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
"Ticked!"

95
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,230
Then why don't you do it to yourself?!

96
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:34,780
Oh? I don't need it, because
I'm already beautiful enough.

97
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,630
Whoa, what a bitch.

98
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,870
Did you say something?

99
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,580
No, nothing.

100
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,560
Just you wait. I'm about to get you back!

101
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,930
Ow, ow, ow... That damn deer-gorilla!
How dare he mock me?!

102
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,980
But more importantly, the key! The key!

103
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,600
I'd better hurry to that secretary woman.

104
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,940
Deer-gorilla! Wait, you jerk!

105
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,510
Gather those who can still fight to
the front of the Courthouse! Do it now!

106
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,680
Don't flinch! Capture the traitors!

107
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,560
You call us traitors?! Don't make me laugh!

108
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,730
It was you, the Navy, who's been
betraying us for the past 50 years!

109
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,860
We're pirates to start with!

110
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,910
What's wrong with pirates
fighting against the Navy?!

111
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,600
Let's go, Oimo!

112
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,210
Yeah, Kashii!

113
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,800
We'll change our strategy and
bring them down individually!

114
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Attack unit! Concentrate
your fire on Kashii's feet!

115
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,470
Now! Charge!

116
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,600
We bow to nobody in human
wave attacks! Keep on going!

117
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,900
H-Hey! Kashii!

118
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,280
Oimo is next! Prepare to fire!

119
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,830
The situation outside has changed?

120
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,280
The giants who changed sides
have been trying hard for us,

121
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,840
but I guess they are at the end of their rope.

122
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,970
Hey! Hey, hurry up!

123
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,830
Dammit! What a disaster.

124
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,860
To think that a pirate would get this far...

125
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Hey, everyone, come in!

126
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,500
CP9! What the hell are you all doing?!

127
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,110
A pirate has gotten this far!

128
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,880
Hey, are you listening?! Say something!

129
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,060
Wait!

130
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,350
What you're holding is...

131
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,780
Whaaat?!

132
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,280
A... A... A golden transponder snail!

133
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:33,140
"Navy"

134
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,950
The silver transponder snail
has received a signal!

135
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,220
A Buster Call has been requested!

136
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,560
A Buster Call has been
requested by Admiral Aokiji!

137
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,240
Where?

138
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,140
Enies Lobby!

139
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,610
Have five of the Vice Admirals
near the destination respond!

140
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,090
Considering the distance,

141
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,820
I think it's quicker to head
there from headquarters.

142
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,450
How quick?

143
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,280
It's possible to get there within 30 minutes.

144
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,760
Immediately have ten battleships
get ready to set sail,

145
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,720
and summon five Vice Admirals!

146
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,950
Be swift!

147
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,810
Yes, sir!

148
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,580
A Buster Call has been requested!

149
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,960
The destination is Enies Lobby!

150
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,250
Have ten battleships get
ready to set sail immediately!

151
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,460
Hey! Hey!

152
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,440
Yes, Chief.

153
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,530
Dammit! Oh, crap! This one is
the portable transponder snail.

154
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,600
What have I done? I wasn't careful.

155
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,560
Of all things, I pressed the button
on the golden transponder snail!

156
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,020
Of all things...

157
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,010
...I requested a Buster Call!

158
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,210
Of all things...

159
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,360
...I requested a Buster Call!

160
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,550
B-Buster Call? D-Don't tell me...

161
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,140
What's this? Some internal communication?

162
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,180
How foolish! Cancel it right away!

163
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,640
That's Robin's voice!

164
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,110
Or it'll be a disaster!

165
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,070
Robin!

166
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,590
What? "Cancel it"?

167
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,270
Hey, hey. Who do you think you're talking to?

168
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,080
What the heck is this broadcast?

169
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,410
Hey! Don't move!

170
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,410
We can't move!

171
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,330
Buster Call is great, isn't it?
What's wrong with it?!

172
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,010
That's Chief Spandam's voice, right?

173
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,010
That's right... There's no problem.

174
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,020
I'm the chief of Cipher Pol No. 9.

175
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,440
In order to hand you over
to the Government smoothly,

176
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,600
I requested a Buster Call.

177
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,490
I see no problem in that!

178
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,570
No matter what happens here,

179
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,620
we'll be able to annihilate
the pirates for sure in the end.

180
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
How foolish...!

181
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,590
I told you, didn't I?!
That won't be the end of it!

182
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,420
There's no humanity in that attack!

183
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,180
That's the Chief... but who's the woman?

184
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,090
The attack will completely burn
Enies Lobby to the ground!

185
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,190
Buildings, people... the very island itself!

186
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,230
It's a nightmarish concentrated fire that
sacrifices everything to achieve its goal!

187
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,160
That's Buster Call!

188
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,830
You don't know what happened in
Ohara twenty years ago. That's why...

189
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,810
That's fine. It means that this is
very important to the Government.

190
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,570
Now that that idiot Cutty Flam has
burned the blueprints for Pluton...

191
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,580
...your existence is the only
clue to the ancient weapon.

192
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,360
A military power that can turn this
whole era upside down is at stake.

193
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,060
If it improves our chances of killing
those idiots trying to get you back,

194
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,560
even if it causes the death
of thousands of soldiers,

195
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,980
we can say that it's an unavoidable
sacrifice for our glorious future!

196
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,940
Above all things, my promotion is at stake, too.

197
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,700
What?! What's he saying?!

198
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,450
He's gonna sacrifice us?! You gotta be kidding!

199
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,410
What do you think of people's lives?!

200
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,530
Don't forget that CP9 is the
Government's secret organization.

201
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,770
If we need 100 deaths in
order to save 1,000 lives,

202
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,380
we'll kill those 100 without
hesitation on the spot.

203
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,270
Mercilessness is also
a necessity for true justice.

204
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,860
Besides, those incompetent soldiers
who couldn't stop the invading pirates

205
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,540
are better off dead, you idiot!

206
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,480
That portable transponder snail...
The line is connected.

207
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,420
What?

208
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,580
Ahhh! Shoot!

209
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,080
Did everyone hear what I just said?!

210
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,690
S-So... my name is Straw Hat Luffy.

211
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,050
Yeah, right!

212
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,590
Everyone! Leave the island!

213
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,020
A Buster Call has been
requested on Enies Lobby!

214
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,980
If you stay on the island, you won't survive!

215
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,940
This isn't your concern!

216
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,370
--B...
--Buster Call...

217
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,330
It sounds like Buster Call has been requested.

218
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,370
What the hell is that man doing?

219
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,570
Sounds like there's some sort of danger.

220
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,550
It's me who's in danger!

221
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,630
I feel sorry for you guys.

222
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,490
Even your hope is gone now.

223
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,890
Don't worry.

224
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,850
We're used to situations like this.

225
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,820
Pirate kid, what kind of
destiny were you born with?

226
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,490
This is getting even more interesting!

227
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,700
A Buster Call has been requested!

228
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,310
Battleships are coming!

229
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,330
Get off of Enies Lobby!

230
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,210
Battleships are coming? Why are
the Navy soldiers running away?

231
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,640
The woman said that the island
will be burned to the ground.

232
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,400
But this is the Government's island!

233
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,050
How should I know why?!

234
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,220
Hey, hey! If you guys're running away,
at least untie us first!

235
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,500
It's a Buster Call!

236
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,640
We'll be dead if we stay here!

237
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,550
Bring some ships to the front!
Get ready to sail out!

238
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,080
The Navy is coming to attack this place!

239
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,440
We got left behind...

240
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,060
Hey! What're we gonna do?!
Isn't this dangerous?!

241
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,350
It's been dangerous ever since
we set foot in this place.

242
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,170
What about Bro?! What's gonna
happen to Big Bro Franky?!

243
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,070
Yeah. If he doesn't come back here,
we can't go back together!

244
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,620
The Straw Hats, too!

245
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,140
So what about us?!

246
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,570
What will... happen to all of us?!

247
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,950
We can't afford to waste time, either.

248
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,030
Yeah, we have to take them out quickly
and hurry to the Gates of Justice.

249
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,780
I've got an idea.

250
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,960
Wh-What? What idea?

251
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,630
A way to get the handcuffs off?
Or a way to escape from here?

252
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,750
You are the renowned sword, Nose Storm.

253
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,810
This is no time to give me a nice name!

254
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,300
Chopper! What's taking so long?!

255
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,360
How dare you open your mouth
and say such stupid stuff?!

256
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,110
If the pirates really get away...

257
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,010
...how are you going to...

258
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,660
...take responsibility for it?!

259
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,370
What was that?!

260
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,010
Where was Robin speaking from?!

261
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,440
The other side of these doors.

262
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,470
I can't let you pass. At least
give me time to say that.

263
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,060
Coo coo.

264
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,690
Get out of my way.
Robin's behind those doors, right?!

265
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,860
So she's there. So what?
You won't be able to see her...

266
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
...ever again.

267
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,780
No... I'll go there to see her!

268
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,350
I'll be right there, Robin!

269
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,970
What's this?! My entire body is slippery!

270
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm sorry. Now that Buster Call has
been requested, playtime is over.

271
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,300
Tempest Kick!

272
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,230
What? A-A fake?

273
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,980
Mirage Tempo. I'm right here!

274
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,800
On the next episode of One Piece!

275
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,070
"Five Namis? Nami Strikes Back with Mirages!"

276
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
