00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,610
"An Ancient Island!
The Shadow Hiding in Little Garden!"

22
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,660
I wonder if it's not gonna snow anymore.

23
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,230
There's no way it would.

24
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,240
Does too. You don't know since
you slept through it last time.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,110
Hmm?

26
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,360
Hey, do you think it'll snow again?

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,840
It could snow, but the sea
we were in first is special...

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,390
...since the seven magnetic forces from
Reverse Mountain mess everything up.

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,910
That doesn't mean you can relax
your attention here, though.

30
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,130
It'd be rare for this sea to
be wild like the first journey,

31
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,520
but it's still true that this sea is a
lot more difficult than ordinary ones.

32
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,520
Never underestimate this sea.
That's the ironclad rule.

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,330
Hey guys!

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,930
Wanna have my special drink?

35
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,750
Yeah!

36
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,720
Thanks!

37
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,580
Say, Usopp. Make a fishing tackle for me.

38
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,990
Fishing, huh? That's a good idea!

39
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,050
Okay. Then I'll make an
artistic fishing rod for you.

40
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,020
Hey, it goes like this.

41
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,240
Wow, you sure can drink.
Hey, is it good?

42
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,790
Whoa! Amazing!

43
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,680
Is this really okay?!

44
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,060
Here, this is for you.

45
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,820
What?

46
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,060
I think it's fine.

47
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,550
They'll work hard if it storms...
since they don't wanna die.

48
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,020
That's true, but it makes me feel
like I'm worked up over nothing.

49
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,970
This ship makes you feel like you don't
have to worry about anything, right?

50
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,980
Attaboy! Go, go, go, go...!

51
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,230
Stupid Karoo!

52
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,410
Yes... it's a lot easier this way...

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,340
Hey, everyone, look!
It's a dolphin!

54
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,300
Whoa! He's cute!

55
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,160
It's huge!!

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,120
Get out of here!

57
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,270
Let's go!

58
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,110
Okay!

59
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,630
Yep!

60
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,630
Alright!

61
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,980
Take that side!

62
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,930
Got it!

63
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,540
Everyone...

64
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,810
Completely unfurl the sails!

65
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,500
Okay! Ride the wave
and shake him off!

66
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,310
Nami! Which direction
should the ship take?

67
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,780
Hold on a sec. Let me check.

68
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,640
Turn to port, full!

69
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,770
Okay!

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,380
Whoa!

71
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,340
There's no mistake.

72
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,010
That island and Cactus Island
are pulling against each other.

73
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,670
Our next stop is...

74
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,800
...that island!

75
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,010
So that's the one!

76
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,110
Our second island in the Grand Line!

77
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,210
Mr. 3...

78
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,830
What is it? Hold on...

79
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,910
There's just nothing like Earl Grey.

80
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm bored.

81
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,200
You say you're bored, but you
don't like working, right?

82
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,850
Right.

83
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:02,410
Then, why don't you try enjoying
this joyous free time a little?

84
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,360
Being able to take a long vacation
like this is a privilege to officer agents.

85
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,070
And...

86
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,870
stop calling me by my code
name in public like this.

87
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,390
People will find out that I'm Mr. 3.

88
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,550
You think?

89
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,560
By the way, you've been looking at that
piece of paper for the past few days.

90
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,290
What on earth is it?

91
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,460
An order from Boss.

92
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,560
You should've told me sooner!

93
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,210
Apparently, Mr. 5 has been taken down.

94
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,540
Humph! If someone had to get taken down,
I wish it were someone like Mr. 2.

95
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,480
Then you could get a promotion.

96
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,710
Mr. 5 being taken down isn't
worth making a big deal over.

97
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,080
After all, that man is just an
"idiot with devil fruit power"

98
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,860
who was overconfident
of his own position.

99
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,320
No matter how amazing the
devil fruit power one gains,

100
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,670
if he can't fully utilize it,
his existence is a total waste.

101
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,700
Superb criminals execute their
crimes using their superb brains.

102
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,620
Let's teach whoever beat Mr. 5...

103
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,080
...the terror of making a criminal
organization their enemy.

104
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,230
So this is Little Garden!

105
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,370
What's "little" about it?!

106
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,120
This place doesn't quite fit its cute name.

107
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,140
Ahh... It's like a terra incognita.
It's a thick jungle!

108
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,880
We have to be careful.

109
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,450
I'm worried about what
Miss All Sunday was saying.

110
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,620
But what's even unluckier is
the course your Log Pose indicates.

111
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,740
The name of the next island is...

112
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,360
...Little Garden.

113
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,330
We don't even need to do anything;

114
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,790
you'll be wiped out long before
you can even reach Alabasta.

115
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,720
A-A-Are you saying
a monster may appear?!

116
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,960
Who knows?

117
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,690
Let's go to our next destination
without going ashore on this one!

118
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,680
But the Log can't be stored so quickly.

119
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,640
Also, we have to stock up on food soon.

120
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,600
We didn't get anything in
the last town we were in.

121
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,920
There's a river mouth there.

122
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,120
What? Really?

123
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,030
I hope there's a BBQ restaurant in here.

124
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,360
As if there'd be one!

125
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,930
But you said we were going
to stock up on food.

126
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,080
We'll collect food to cook later!
Geez, what're you thinking?

127
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,050
But it's dangerous to go ashore.

128
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,710
Just take a look at the
plants here to start with.

129
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,000
I've never seen anything like them,
even in encyclopedias.

130
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,840
Ahh!

131
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,400
How cute!

132
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,250
You mean me?

133
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,570
Obviously I meant Nami-san!

134
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,320
What was it I just heard?

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,860
It's all right. It's just a bird.

136
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,780
And this is just a jungle. Don't worry.

137
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,330
What's the matter?

138
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,750
What was that for, you damn bird?!

139
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,710
A lizard... I wonder if it tastes good.

140
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,500
Is that a kind of noise you
hear from just any jungle?

141
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,000
That sounded like a volcano erupted!

142
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,760
A tiger?!

143
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,080
It's too huge!

144
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,680
Ah!

145
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,100
What?! What happened?!

146
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,990
This isn't normal!
This is definitely not normal!

147
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,030
Why does a tiger, king of the jungle,
fall covered in blood?!

148
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,770
Ah! It's decided that we're not
gonna go ashore on this island!

149
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,580
We'll quietly wait on the ship
until the Log is stored and...

150
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,220
Right!

151
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,390
...leave this island as soon as possible.

152
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,260
Right!

153
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,590
W... We have to go to Alabasta quickly...

154
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,630
Hmph!

155
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,650
Sanji! Make lunch for me!

156
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,460
Lunch?

157
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah! For replenishing energy!

158
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,810
A "pirate lunch" with
lots of meat and no veggies!

159
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,440
I can smell adventure in the air!

160
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,890
W-Wait a sec! Where're you going?!

161
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,660
Adventure!

162
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,250
Wanna come along?
Adventure! Adventure!

163
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,880
It's useless... I can't stop him.
He's too enthusiastic...

164
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,610
Is he crazy? There's a monster
that beat up a huge tiger in here!

165
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,010
Sanji! Make lunch for me!

166
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,840
Okay. Hold on a bit.

167
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,470
Say, can I come with you?

168
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,360
What?!

169
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,020
Sure! Come, come!

170
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,810
Not you too!

171
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,230
Yeah... If I just sit around here, I may
start thinking about all sorts of things.

172
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,700
I'll go out to take my mind off
things until the Log is stored.

173
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,400
No way! It may be okay for Luffy,
but it's too dangerous for you!

174
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,070
I'll be fine since Karoo will be with me.

175
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,030
He's too shocked to say a word, though.

176
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,040
Then, I'll make a lunch
of love for Vivi-chan.

177
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,210
Could you prepare something
to drink for Karoo?

178
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,420
Of course! Please leave it to me!

179
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,690
Okay.

180
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,610
Now you're all set. Two pirate
lunches and a special drink for Karoo.

181
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,550
Okay!

182
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,780
Well, then. See you later!

183
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,450
All right! Let's go!

184
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,560
We'll be back in a little while!

185
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,150
Miss Wednesday sure is brave.

186
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,750
As may be expected from someone
who infiltrated an enemy organization.

187
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,460
Well, I'm bored too,
so I'll go take a walk.

188
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,590
Take a walk?!

189
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,840
Heave ho!

190
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,760
Ah! Hey, Zoro!

191
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,540
Wait!

192
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,430
Hmm?

193
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,610
We're short of food.

194
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,390
If you see animals that
appear edible, bring them back.

195
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,070
Okay, got it.

196
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,440
I'll bring back one that
you can't possibly capture.

197
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,240
Wait, you bastard!

198
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,750
Hmm?!

199
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,150
I can't let that remark go unchallenged!

200
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,380
You can capture a bigger
one than I can, you say?!

201
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,450
Of course.

202
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,410
Then, it's a hunting match.

203
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,450
Look! We'll compete over how
many kilos of meat we get.

204
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,720
Didn't you mean to say how many tons?

205
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,680
You can talk cocky once
you've brought back some prey.

206
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,590
Humph! I'll take you up on that!

207
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,190
I wonder... why they're all like that?

208
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,820
I understand how you feel.

209
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,440
Don't cry. I'm on your side.

210
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,630
We're sitting ducks...

211
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,720
That's my line!

212
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,890
But wait a sec...

213
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,460
W-W-What's the matter?!

214
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,920
N-N-N-N-Nami?!

215
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,390
This isn't it... This isn't, either.

216
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,320
Ouch! Ow, ow...! H-Hey, Nami! Nami!

217
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,660
Hey... what the heck
are you looking for?

218
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,070
I remember reading about it in a book.

219
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,810
A... About what?

220
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,240
Little Garden.

221
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,900
Oops!

222
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,340
What's the matter?

223
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,180
Here, look at this!
There's a shellfish like a squid.

224
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,090
A squid shellfish!

225
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,090
It looks a lot like the ammonite.

226
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,050
It's a squid shellfish, right?

227
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,490
I feel like someone's been
following me for a while...

228
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,990
Well, it must be my imagination.

229
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,880
How dare you mess with me?!

230
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,410
Collier Shoot!

231
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,920
Hm...

232
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,520
What the hell is this? Is it edible?

233
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,480
Let me see... which one was it?

234
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,380
I think I read it recently,
but it slipped my mind.

235
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,770
Oh? Why is there a Sea King on the land?

236
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,870
A dinosaur!

237
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,130
A dinosaur?!

238
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,950
Then, this is an ancient island!

239
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,100
Huh?

240
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,050
The land here is stuck in
the time of the dinosaurs!

241
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:53,970
Hmm?

242
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,650
Since there were no exchanges
among islands in the Grand Line

243
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,250
due to the difficulties with sea travel,

244
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,600
each one established its unique culture.

245
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,890
There are islands that have an
extremely sophisticated culture...

246
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,000
and there're some others
that remain in the same form

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,260
without progressing for several thousand
or tens of thousands years...

248
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,620
The random climate in the
Grand Line makes it possible.

249
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,970
That's why this island
exists in the dinosaur time.

250
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,290
Amazing!

251
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,750
Luffy!

252
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Don't jump on it!

253
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,670
Usopp! Usopp!

254
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,110
What? What's the matter?

255
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,330
Did you find the book?

256
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,960
Yeah...

257
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,300
Humph! What a rude guy...

258
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,550
So we both use the Three-Sword Style...

259
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,610
This is bad. On this island...

260
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,660
On this island...

261
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,760
Ah!!

262
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,430
What? It felt like
Nami-san just called me...

263
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:55,180
"To those residents,
this island is as if a 'little garden.'

264
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,860
Little Garden...

265
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,180
That's what I'll call this place."

266
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,380
Louis Arnote, explorer.

267
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

268
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

269
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

270
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

271
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,170
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

272
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

273
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

274
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

275
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

276
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

277
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

278
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

279
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,650
Ahhh! A giant!

280
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,650
Pretend we're dead.

281
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,990
Doesn't that only work on bears?

282
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,660
Whoa! It's huge!
Are you a human, old guy?

283
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,990
With a big catch like this...

284
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,330
In this hunting match...

285
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,990
I'm the winner!

286
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,750
Hey, old guy. Where're you going?

287
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,130
Duel?!

288
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,830
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,000
"Huge Duel!
The Giants Dorry and Broggy"

290
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
