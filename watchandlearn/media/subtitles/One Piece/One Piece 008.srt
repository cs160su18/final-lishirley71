2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,550
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,610
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,770
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,390
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,910
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,520
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,040
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,510
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,140
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,850
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,320
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:25,250
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,130
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,910
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,740
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,940
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,510
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,050
We are!

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,230
Die!

25
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,190
Oni Giri!

26
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,810
Beaten by mere sneak thieves...

27
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,280
We ain't sneak thieves...
We're pirates!

28
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,860
Yes! The chart of the Grand Line!

29
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,940
I'll never forgive him!

30
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,140
"Who is the Victor?
Devil Fruit Power Showdown!"

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,380
In all my life, I've never been
as mad at someone as him!

32
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,950
That bastard Shanks stole
enormous riches from me!

33
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,240
I don't know how
you two are connected,

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,280
but I can say whatever
I want about him!

35
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,340
Get him! Get him! Fight!

36
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,260
Don't neither of you lose!

37
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,810
The North Pole!

38
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,790
No, the South Pole!

39
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,970
You still say that, huh?!

40
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,420
That's right! I'll always say it!
'Cause I'm right!

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Oh, you got guts! I'm gonna
settle this once and for all today!

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,130
Go ahead and try it!

43
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,390
Alright, you bastard!
I'm gonna bust you up flashily!

44
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,260
Counterattack!

45
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,420
Knock that off!

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,090
Who cares which is colder,
the North Pole or the South Pole?!

47
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,840
If you wanna know that badly,
go to both and find out!

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,120
Now cool it!

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,780
A ship!

50
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,600
Enemy ship to the north-northeast!

51
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,610
Alright! Get ready! It's fightin' time!

52
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,390
Alright! I'm gonna plunder like crazy!

53
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,730
You sure seem happy, Buggy!

54
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,690
Obviously!

55
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,910
Enemy ships are like treasure chests.

56
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,460
It's natural for pirates
to raid 'em! Am I wrong?!

57
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,960
Well, there is some truth to that.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,460
You're too weak!

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,830
You and everyone else here
never talk seriously about treasure!

60
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,340
You don't know what it
means to be a pirate!

61
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,960
W-What's this?!

62
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,760
A-A-A treasure map!

63
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,460
I-I've never seen
one before! Awesome!

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,560
Is it sitting on the
bottom of the ocean?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,380
Yes! Now my life
is flashily decided!

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,600
Today was another easy win!

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,650
Hey! Drink up!

68
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,330
Hey, Buggy!

69
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,050
You're not gonna party with us?
We found some neat loot!

70
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,130
I-I don't got anything special!
I don't know anything!

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,830
What're you talking about?

72
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,300
Oh, uhh...

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,640
You said you were gonna
leave this ship sometime.

74
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,560
What do you plan to do?

75
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,570
I'm gonna have my own ship.

76
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm gonna gather a reliable
crew and then see the world.

77
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,370
I'm gonna take my time.
All as a pirate, of course.

78
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,260
You always spew that weakling crap!

79
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,200
Say what?!

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,270
I only admire your fighting skill.

81
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,290
Were you just not soft-hearted,
I might've made you my henchman.

82
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,570
Your henchman? Get real!

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,300
Huh?

84
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,910
We think differently, so we should
just go in our own directions.

85
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,140
That's what pirates do.

86
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,380
Talking like you're an expert, huh?

87
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,860
But if we ever meet on the ocean,
it'll be a fight to the death.

88
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,060
Yeah. That's another thing pirates do.

89
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,130
You never make sense.

90
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,930
Anyways, you said
something about loot...

91
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,960
Yeah, we found a Devil Fruit.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,070
Devil Fruit?

93
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,490
I heard they're incarnations
of the sea devil.

94
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,060
Supposedly, if you eat one,
you gain devil powers...

95
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,210
...but the sea will hate you
and take your ability to swim!

96
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,090
You'd have to be stupid
to eat something like that!

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,580
I'd never get that treasure on
the ocean floor if I couldn't swim!

98
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,610
Still, I bet it'd sell for
100 million Berries...

99
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,770
What?!

100
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,100
I, pirate apprentice Buggy,
will now eat this Devil Fruit!

101
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,130
Gotta love kids!

102
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,610
Never thinking about consequences...

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,690
He ate it!

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, Buggy? Anything
different about your body?

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,750
No... Not really...

106
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,420
Aww, it was a fake?

107
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,060
Not surprising, I've only heard
about Devil Fruits from rumors...

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,420
Yes! That worked flashily well!

109
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,220
What I ate this afternoon
was a fake I made!

110
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,260
Can't believe everything
went so smoothly!

111
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,540
Now to jump ship before
they find out the truth!

112
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,990
With the money from the Devil Fruit
and the treasure on the map,

113
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,110
I could form my own
pirate group right away!

114
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,520
Hey, Buggy!

115
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,400
Whatcha grinnin' about?

116
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,900
O-Oh, it's you!
Don't scare me like that!

117
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,670
What kind of look is that?

118
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,510
Don't steal too much
food from the kitchen;

119
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,870
the cook'll get mad!

120
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,310
Whew, that was close...

121
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,960
Oh, that reminds me!
The captain just--

122
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,460
Shanks! Damn you!

123
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,840
My... My... I'm...

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,290
What's that scrap of paper?

125
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,140
Ahh! My map!

126
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,400
H-Hey, Buggy!

127
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,330
W-What the--? I can't move...

128
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,090
Was it true you lose
the ability to swim?!

129
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,820
Crap!

130
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,240
Hey! Buggy! What're you doing?

131
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,750
You're great at swimming!

132
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,990
Buggy!

133
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,270
H-Help me...

134
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,990
I'll save you, Buggy!

135
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,970
So Shanks saved you?

136
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,220
That's not what I'm trying to say!

137
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,390
Because of him, my plan in life
was suddenly delayed 10 years!

138
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,440
And then I had a revelation!

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,360
If underwater's no good,
I'll obtain all the treasure on land!

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,110
...Using this Chop-Chop power.

141
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,700
That's why I won't let anyone
who touches my treasure live!

142
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,840
Let go...

143
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,140
...of my treasure!

144
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,910
Crap! He spotted me!

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,840
Don't think you can escape me, Nami!

146
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,880
I'm going to flashily chop you up!

147
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,160
M-My balls... balls...

148
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,110
You're still dealing with me!

149
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,740
Something's wrong.

150
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,880
The mayor's never been
gone this long before...

151
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
Something must be
happening in town after all!

152
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,610
There's been more
cannon fire than usual, too!

153
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,650
Alright! I'll go into town and
check it out! You all stay here!

154
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm coming too!

155
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,990
Fool! There are pirates in town!

156
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,650
The despicable Buggy Pirates!

157
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,260
Exactly! I'm coming too!

158
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,590
What kind of citizens are we...

159
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,530
...if we can't even
keep our mayor safe?!

160
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,980
It's no use trying to stop us!
This is all of our own accord!

161
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,940
Fine, whatever!

162
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,160
Let's go, everyone!

163
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,190
Hey!

164
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,150
Leave that treasure
and get out of here!

165
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,560
He'll come after you again!

166
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,430
No!

167
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,960
Leave the treasure and go?!
Absolutely not!

168
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,620
Why should I have to leave
my own treasure behind?!

169
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,570
Your treasure?!

170
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,230
Duh!

171
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm a thief who only
steals from pirates,

172
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,530
and I just stole from one!

173
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,800
Which means this
treasure is mine now!

174
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,530
Ah, I see!

175
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,690
Nonsense! That's my treasure!

176
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,420
Do you think stealing
it makes it yours?!

177
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,320
Honestly! What kind of
upbringing did you have?!

178
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,850
A criminal, trying to lecture
another criminal? Ridiculous!

179
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,800
What?!

180
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,060
I haven't fallen so low that I
need to be corrected by pirates!

181
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,820
I hope you're ready to face
the consequences, Nami...

182
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,900
Chop-Chop...

183
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,360
...Festival!

184
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,850
Just try and help your friend,
if you can, Gum-Gum!

185
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,300
Damn, he broke into even more parts!

186
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,990
What the--?

187
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,340
Nami!

188
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,760
Give me my back my treasure!

189
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,840
You wish!

190
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,550
Coochie, coochie, coo!

191
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,930
Geez, you're stubborn!

192
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,900
Knock it off!

193
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,040
No, you knock it off!

194
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,580
Thanks for the treasure back!

195
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,040
--Let go! Let go! That's mine!
--Let go?! This is my treasure!

196
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,670
You let go!

197
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,250
Die!

198
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,230
I told you... you're dealing with me!

199
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,340
Consider that finishing move
a kick from the old mayor guy!

200
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,260
T-Thanks, I owe you one...

201
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,700
Yeah, no problem!

202
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,130
--Oh yeah! The map!
--My treasure--!

203
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,100
This isn't over yet, Gum-Gum!

204
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,220
He's still alive!

205
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,680
Shut up!

206
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,100
How dare you flashily
do this to me!

207
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,400
You'll pay for this!

208
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,860
Assemble! Chop-Chop Parts!

209
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,160
Huh?

210
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,710
Looking for these?!

211
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,960
My parts!

212
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,300
Way to go, thief!

213
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,340
S-Stop!

214
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,930
Go flying, Buggy!

215
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,230
Gum-Gum...

216
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,300
...Bazooka!

217
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,520
I win!

218
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,210
Hey! Captain Buggy went flying off!

219
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,740
W-What do we do now?!

220
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,930
Act unconscious for now!

221
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,870
Good idea!

222
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,670
It's all torn up now...

223
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,640
Well, that's okay! I can still put it on,

224
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,940
plus I sent Buggy flying,
so I'm satisfied.

225
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,030
It's all right.
I'll fix it for you later.

226
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,360
Eh? What?

227
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,630
Nothing!

228
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,290
Hey, anyways, I split it into
two bags, so carry half of it!

229
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,250
It's too heavy for me!

230
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,770
There sure is a lot!

231
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,400
If anything, Buggy does know
quality treasure when he sees it!

232
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,290
All this should go for no less
than 10 million Berries!

233
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,710
Here you go.

234
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,700
Eh?

235
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,720
It's the chart of the Grand Line.
Didn't you want it?

236
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,870
You're giving it to me?!

237
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,540
You did save me.

238
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,620
Thanks, Nami!

239
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,870
I finally got a map of the Grand Line!

240
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,430
Hurray!

241
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,050
Oh! Does that mean you'll
join our crew now?!

242
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,080
I told you I'm never going
to join a pirate crew!

243
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,280
But okay! Staying with you
guys seems profitable enough.

244
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,880
But I'm only teaming up
with you, just so you know!

245
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,530
Always remember that!

246
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,620
Yeah!

247
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,910
Hey! Zoro! Wake up! Zoro!

248
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,010
We're going!

249
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,920
Did we take care of everything?

250
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,520
Yeah! We also got
the map and a navigator!

251
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,630
No good... Out of blood...
I don't think I can walk...

252
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,910
Of course you can't!

253
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,800
You wouldn't be human
if you two could walk!

254
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,580
Why am I included?

255
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,170
You're the most suspicious of all!

256
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,240
Anyways, we gotta help the mayor...

257
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,640
Oh yeah!

258
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,410
We gotta wake up
the old mayor guy now...

259
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,600
You, there!

260
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,680
Are you outsiders?!

261
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,500
Yeah... Who are you?

262
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,370
We're this town's citizens!

263
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,630
Did the pirates have
a falling out or something?!

264
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,280
If you know anything, tell us!

265
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,010
Oh, it's just the citizens!

266
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,710
I thought they were
more of the pirates...

267
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,830
Oh, Mayor!

268
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,530
Oh, no! Say something!

269
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,620
Hey! Mayor!

270
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,360
He's out cold!

271
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,860
The pirates definitely did this!

272
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,740
How horrible!

273
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,720
Sorry! I kicked that old man's ass!

274
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,190
What?!

275
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,740
Hold on! You don't
need to tell them that!

276
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,760
You saw it.

277
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,270
Yeah, but you had an actual reason...

278
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,290
Why did you guys do
this to our mayor?!

279
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,740
Don't give us your excuses!

280
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,580
Who are you?!
Are you with those pirates?!

281
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,230
They're really bloodthirsty...

282
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,040
If we accidentally say
we're thieves or pirates...

283
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,380
We're pirates!

284
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,080
--Just as we thought!
--Just as we thought!

285
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,570
You idiot!

286
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,380
It's the truth!

287
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,630
Pirates! How dare
you ravage our town?!

288
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,720
We won't show mercy
just 'cause you're kids!

289
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,370
What now? Doesn't look
like they'll hear us out...

290
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,990
Run!

291
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,260
There's no escape!

292
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,260
How dare you hurt
our beloved mayor?!

293
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,300
Ugh! Why did you
make things worse?!

294
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,790
--This is a good town!
--Eh?!

295
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,930
Everyone's so mad,
just for the old mayor guy!

296
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,040
I think they'd get mad
at any excuse we give!

297
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,920
We're turning here!

298
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,450
H-Hold on!
Don't say that so suddenly!

299
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,090
They ran into the alley!

300
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,400
Chouchou?!

301
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,790
Dog!

302
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,160
H-Hey! Move, Chouchou! Hey!

303
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,140
Those guys are bad pirates!

304
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,540
You're barking at the wrong people!

305
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,200
Why are you getting in the way?!

306
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,500
Chouchou! Let us through!

307
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,330
Chouchou!

308
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,600
Later, dog!

309
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,100
That was scary!

310
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,370
We managed to escape
thanks to Chouchou!

311
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,800
Why do we have to put up with this?!

312
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,090
Does it matter now?
We're done here anyway...

313
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,240
--Maybe so, but...
--Hey, is this your boat?!

314
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,690
It's great!

315
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,090
I don't think it's so great.

316
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,770
I stole it from some idiot pirates.

317
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,940
That's a big mouth ya got!

318
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,330
Been waitin' for ya, thief girl!

319
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,840
Never thought you'd
run into us here, didja?!

320
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,360
You know them?

321
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,650
Yeah... sort of!

322
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,110
Not sort of! We're bound by fate!

323
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,350
So you had friends, huh?
Guess we'll hafta punish you, too!

324
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,220
You're gonna learn how bad it is
to steal other people's stuff!

325
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,640
Hey, you! Quit ignorin' me!

326
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,190
Huh?!

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,200
Mayor! Are you conscious?!

328
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,870
Thank goodness! You're all right!

329
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
What on earth happened?!

330
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,410
What in the--?!

331
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,080
It was already like this
when we got here!

332
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,020
There were some pirates left,
but they all ran off!

333
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,930
Did you not see anything
that happened?!

334
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,980
Where are the young'uns?!

335
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,320
Do you mean those three kids?

336
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,290
So they're alive?!

337
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,780
Those fools! How dare they
harm a senior citizen like me!

338
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,770
We just finished driving
those idiots away!

339
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,870
But it's still not enough!

340
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,920
They almost seemed
to be mocking us!

341
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,950
They'd never understand how we
felt when they attacked our town!

342
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,250
Yeah! Yeah!

343
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,300
There's still time to go
after them and catch--

344
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,800
Shut up!

345
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm the only one who's allowed
to complain about them!

346
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,920
I won't let anyone else
talk badly about them!

347
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,270
W-What?! Why are you
protecting pirates?!

348
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,580
Damn them... So they
plan to just disappear?!

349
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,060
Where did they go?!

350
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,730
They, uhh, ran toward the port.

351
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,150
--Damn it!
--Mayor! Mayor!

352
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,080
They think they can do whatever
they please in my town!

353
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,450
I have lots to say to you all!

354
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,660
Alright! Let's get going!

355
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,220
Isn't that Buggy's mark
on your sail there?

356
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,380
Well, this is his boat.
I'll get rid of it sometime!

357
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,750
Hey! Wait!

358
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,010
Young'uns!

359
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,720
The old mayor guy!

360
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,560
I was ready to die!

361
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,160
I was ready to die
filled with despair!

362
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,870
Thanks! We're in your debt!

363
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,340
Don't worry about it! Take it easy!

364
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,800
Damn you young'uns...
Damn you young'uns...

365
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,140
Damn you young'uns...

366
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,060
I have no words...

367
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,100
What?!

368
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,420
You left one of the treasure bags?!

369
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,230
Yeah.

370
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,080
Just one is worth
5 million Berries, you know!

371
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,590
But they need money to fix
their destroyed town, right?

372
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,530
That was my treasure!

373
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,500
Do you know how much
I suffered trying to steal it?!

374
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,020
Why did you do that?!

375
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,090
Stop! I can't swim!

376
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,820
That's the whole idea!

377
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,830
If you want it,
go back and get it then!

378
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,100
I can't do that! You go get it!

379
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,740
No! Wahh, that's dangerous!
I could die, you know!

380
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,250
Die once!

381
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,450
Do that again and I really will
throw you into the ocean!

382
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,010
Well, for better or worse,

383
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,900
looks like a navigator's
joined our journey.

384
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:24,320
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

385
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,260
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

386
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,020
before someone else could
beat me to it

387
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:52,450
If the world is going to change

388
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:59,450
before I can even attain my dream

389
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:06,530
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

390
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:19,460
so that my memories won't fade

391
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,870
Wow! We actually reached land!

392
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,810
Of course we did!
We followed the map!

393
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,140
There's a village up ahead!

394
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,750
They got a place to eat, I hope?!

395
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,980
I wanna eat some meat!

396
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,200
Forget about food, you guys!

397
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,900
Hey! Who's he?!

398
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,690
Where?!

399
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,250
He says he's a pirate captain!

400
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,540
On the next episode of One Piece!

401
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,170
"Liar of Justice? Captain Usopp"

402
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,370
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
