00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,420
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,390
I'll never give up on this ship!

24
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,560
Are you guys stupid or what?!

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,780
You probably got fooled by the shipwrights'
convincing argument, didn't you?!

26
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,030
The Luffy I know would've believed
in the strength of the Merry first

27
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,580
rather than buying those guys' sales talk!

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,160
Such a clear-cut answer that sounds

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,500
like one made by an old man
who understands everything...

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,580
How can you make a decision like that,
suddenly acting all captain-like?!

31
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,710
I misjudged you, Luffy!

32
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,630
Wait a sec, Usopp! Luffy, too, first--

33
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,550
Stay out of this, Nami!
This is something I decided!

34
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,930
I won't change my opinion.
No matter what you say now,

35
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,970
we're gonna get a new ship!
We'll say goodbye to the Merry here!

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,940
Listen, Luffy! It's not like everyone
can live looking ahead like you do!

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,150
I can't just leave our wounded friend
here and move on to the seas ahead!

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,610
Don't be ridiculous! Even if she's a friend,
ships and humans are different!

39
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,110
They're the same! Merry has
the strength to live left in her!

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,200
--Considering how you are, aren't you
excited thinking about the new ship
--Hey, that's enough, you guys!

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,830
--while pretending to be concerned about Merry?!
--You can't have a conversation
if you're worked up like that!

42
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,120
Enough, already!

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,250
Luffy!

44
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,500
Don't think that you're the only
one who feels pain over this!

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,040
Everyone feels the same way!

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,710
If so, there's no way you'd
decide to get a new ship!

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,470
Fine! If you dislike what I decide
that much, then get off this--

48
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,100
Sanji...!

49
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,980
You idiot... What were you about to say?!

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,190
Cool down! Be careful about what you say!

51
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,370
Sorry. I just...

52
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,420
That's okay, Luffy. That's how
you really feel, isn't it?

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,340
What'd you say?!

54
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,130
Go ahead and cut off useless friends
one after another and move on.

55
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,640
If you're gonna abandon the Merry...

56
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,600
...why don't you do that to me, too?!

57
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,900
You don't need weak friends, right?

58
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,190
Luffy... you're the man
who'll be king of the pirates.

59
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,990
But I don't have to go that high up.

60
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,490
Hey, where're you going, Usopp?!

61
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,200
Where I'm going is my own business.

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm...

63
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,750
...leaving the gang.

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,380
Usopp!

65
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,420
Wait! It shouldn't be like this!

66
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,180
Hey! Turn around!

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Luffy! I can't go along with you anymore.

68
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,610
Sorry to cause you trouble until the end.

69
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,070
It's true that the ship
belongs to you, the captain.

70
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
So fight me...

71
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,370
Monkey D. Luffy!

72
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,960
Fight a duel with me!

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,630
At 10 o'clock tonight, I'll come back here.

74
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,970
Then, we'll fight a duel over the Merry!

75
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,810
I'll defeat you and take the Merry.

76
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,560
That's...

77
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,560
...the end of the bond
between you guys and me.

78
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:51,490
"Luffy vs. Usopp! Collision of Two Men's Pride"

79
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,540
I am Usopp, leader of the great
pirates who reign over this village!

80
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:06,170
People praise me-- and then praise
me more-- as "Captain Usopp"!

81
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,300
You're neat!

82
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,890
Hey, you! Don't insult me!

83
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,350
I'm a very proud man!

84
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,900
Because of my great pride,
people call me "Proud Usopp"!

85
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,200
You guys take care, too!
Let's meet again sometime!

86
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,490
--How come?
--Huh? How come? Man, you're antisocial...

87
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm gonna be a pirate too, so we'll
meet on the high seas eventually!

88
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,370
What're you talkin' about? Get on already.

89
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,830
Eh?

90
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,880
We're friends now, aren't we?

91
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,340
I... I get to be captain, right?!

92
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,680
Don't be dumb! I'm the captain!

93
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,650
So you didn't get cold feet, huh?

94
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,320
You'd better be sure you're not going
to regret this, no matter what happens.

95
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,780
This is the duel you wanted.

96
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,290
Of course. You'd better fight seriously.

97
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,160
I'll turn the tables on you.

98
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,790
I've already figured out how to defeat you.

99
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,300
Can't we stop them?
Usopp is wounded quite badly!

100
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,380
If you can't bear to watch this, go inside.

101
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,650
Don't lump me in with your past
enemies who didn't know your skills.

102
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,070
Luffy... We've known each other for a long time.

103
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,950
I know about your powers very well.

104
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,370
Don't be surprised when you hear this, Luffy.

105
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,250
I have 8,000 men under me!

106
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,000
If you don't wanna die, surrender now!

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,710
What?! 8,000?! That many?!

108
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,380
You go inside.

109
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,420
You don't have any subordinates.
I know that much!

110
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,130
Usopp Spell!

111
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,560
You've got razors stuck between all your teeth!

112
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,810
It hurts just to imagine that!

113
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,390
Go inside.

114
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,520
You've got cactus spines inside your fingernails!

115
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,400
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

116
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,080
Usopp!

117
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,040
See?! His body is already...

118
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,500
Special Attack... Ketchup Star!

119
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,630
What? Are you sympathizing with
your enemy? What confidence...!

120
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,760
Flash Dial!

121
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,600
Special Attack! Egg Star!

122
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,020
Star! Star! Star!

123
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,570
It stinks! They're rotten!

124
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,480
Dammit! You jerk! Be serious!

125
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,860
Is this silly? I'm very serious, Luffy!

126
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,120
--What?
--This is my way of fighting!

127
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,620
Hey, if you open your mouth
that big, you'll have a burn!

128
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,630
Special Attack! Tabasco Star!

129
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,590
It's hooot!!

130
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,550
Watch out when you wriggle!

131
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,880
Beneath your feet, it's already Caltrop Hell!

132
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,180
Ouch!

133
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,640
Usopp is in control of the fight!

134
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,480
Listen, Luffy!

135
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,860
I'll defeat you without fail and take the Merry...

136
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,320
...no matter what it takes!

137
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,030
Usopp...

138
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,780
Special Attack! Pepper Star!

139
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,750
Owwww!

140
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,050
I told you. I won't use attacks
that won't work on you.

141
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,810
Dammit. It stinks... My mouth is burning...

142
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,310
And it hurts!

143
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,480
I won't give you even the
slightest chance to attack!

144
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,280
Special Attack! Shuriken Shooting Stars!

145
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,570
Smoke?

146
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm using a Breath Dial.

147
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,500
You didn't notice the smell
because of the eggs, did you?

148
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,710
The smell of the gas that's
filling the area around you...!

149
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,590
Gas?

150
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,590
Don't tell me...!

151
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,970
Sorry! Take this!

152
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,760
Flame Star!

153
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,940
What an explosion!

154
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,830
Luffy! Usopp!

155
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,720
I am Usopp, leader of the great
pirates who reign over this village!

156
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,980
People praise me-- and then praise
me more-- as "Captain Usopp"!

157
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,110
You're neat!

158
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,700
Hey, you! Don't insult me!

159
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
How come?

160
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,450
We're friends now, aren't we?

161
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,920
I see an island!

162
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,250
Whoa! Incredible! What kind of island is that?!

163
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,710
All right! Go!

164
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,630
Merry! Full speed ahead!

165
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,220
Full speed ahead!

166
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,240
I can't stand this.

167
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,780
Luffy! Usopp!

168
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,890
I know... that an attack like
that wouldn't take you out.

169
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,100
I know, Luffy...

170
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,230
...that you fight every battle
with all your strength.

171
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,530
I know every detail of your skills!

172
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,280
Special Attack...!

173
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,000
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

174
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,210
...Bursting Cactus Star!

175
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,880
Ouch!

176
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,220
Triple Exploding Stars!

177
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,190
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

178
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,710
Gum-Gum... Bazooka!

179
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,050
I have a dial here.

180
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,640
I got... your impact!

181
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,640
Impact!

182
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,900
An Impact Dial!

183
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,540
How'd you like that?! Dammit!

184
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:53,570
I am Usopp, leader of the great
pirates who reign over this village!

185
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,200
To our new ship and crewmate!

186
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,160
Cheers!

187
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,710
I guess that's more like it.

188
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,880
It's good! Let's draw it on the sail, too!

189
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,840
Alright! All done!

190
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,090
Now the Going Merry pirate ship is all set!

191
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,140
Gum-Gum...

192
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,390
...Bullet!

193
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Usopp!

194
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,640
Game over.

195
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,990
You fool...!

196
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,870
There's no way that you
could defeat me, is there?!

197
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,150
I can't stand this...

198
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,330
Do what you want with the Merry.

199
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,760
We'll get a new ship and
move on to the seas ahead!

200
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,930
Hey! Let me sit there, too, Luffy!

201
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,720
No! This is my special seat!

202
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Oh? What's that?!

203
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,220
What're you making, Usopp?

204
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,600
Whoa! Hey, you guys!
No shoes in Usopp Factory!

205
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,910
Someday, I will go to Elbaf!

206
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,540
To the village of warriors!

207
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,540
All right, Usopp! Let's go there for sure!

208
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,590
Let's get this party goin'! It's the
night festival before gold-hunting!

209
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,850
Well then, bye, Usopp...

210
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,770
It's been fun.

211
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,320
Hey, don't go, Chopper!

212
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,410
Why not?! He was already
wounded so badly to start with,

213
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,990
and now he got beat up worse!

214
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,120
This isn't a quarrel or a game.

215
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,290
So what?! I'm a doctor!
Let me at least treat him!

216
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,970
He lost the duel. On top of that, he gets pitied.

217
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,220
Imagine just how miserable
that must make him feel!

218
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,930
Imagine how much suffering careless
kindness can cause the loser!

219
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,360
He fought a duel knowing full well
this was how it might turn out!

220
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,450
This is really tough...

221
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,000
That's what it means to be a captain, isn't it?

222
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,960
Don't lose yourself.

223
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,050
If you waver, who can we trust?

224
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,570
Let's vacate the ship.

225
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,460
We can't come back... to this ship, so...

226
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,070
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

227
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,610
Chasing after something constant

228
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,200
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

229
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,490
Even when we're exhausted

230
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,660
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

231
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,090
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

232
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,010
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

233
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

234
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,760
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

235
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,850
Eternally... Eternally...

236
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,640
Wild fantasies from our childhood

237
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,480
We trace unforgettable memories

238
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,150
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

239
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,990
To this familiar sunny sky

240
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,780
Together we entrust our feelings

241
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,370
We go beyond the changing time

242
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,000
Eternally... Eternally...

243
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,010
Luffy, there's trouble! The whole
town is talking about this!

244
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,760
--What's the matter?
--They say that Iceberg-san was
shot at home and is unconscious.

245
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,720
Ice pops is?! I'll go check.

246
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,470
--I'll go, too.
--Then, Chopper and I'll go look for Robin-chan.

247
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,520
I kinda have a bad feeling.

248
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

249
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,110
"Severe Shock Hits the City
of Water! Iceberg Targeted!"

250
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,530
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
