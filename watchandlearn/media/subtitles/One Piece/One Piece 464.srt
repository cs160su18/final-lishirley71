2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
saa yukou

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
So let's go

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Without stopping

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll keep getting back up

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
shinjita sono saki e to...

49
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,390
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,980
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,630
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,730
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,650
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,700
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,560
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,180
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,300
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,500
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,360
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,040
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ
to rescue his brother, Ace

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,120
who is about to be executed!

64
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,370
Meanwhile, at Marineford,

65
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,510
the great war between the Navy and
the Whitebeard Pirates has begun!

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,030
Yasakani Sacred Jewel!

67
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,520
I knew that you wouldn't let me...

68
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,230
...strike your head that easily.

69
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,150
What is he doing?!

70
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,520
Stop this if you can!

71
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,500
If all three of us left our positions...

72
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,840
...who would cover them?!

73
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,670
Great Eruption!

74
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,970
Get away!

75
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,740
He lit up the place too brightly.

76
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,340
Why don't you light up birthday
cakes instead, you magma squirt!

77
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't you want an illuminated
funeral for yourself, Whitebeard?

78
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,490
"A Descendent of the Beast!
Little Oars Jr.--Full Speed Ahead!"

79
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,170
I didn't know that there are
such giant men in this world.

80
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,800
He's truly a beast!

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,560
If I can have his dead body,

82
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,240
that means I can have the
strongest zombie again!

83
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,790
Get to the scaffold quick!

84
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,320
The Giant unit is on the move!

85
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,470
Don't be afraid!

86
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,200
They are after Little Oars Jr.!

87
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,600
It's our duty to...

88
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,250
...Stop him!

89
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,590
He's unbelievably big -

90
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,640
more than twice as big as a common Giant!

91
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,130
Keep shooting!

92
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,170
He's still a human-being
so it should work against him!

93
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,570
They brought such an unthinkably
powerful creature with them.

94
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,300
Shoot him! Shoot him up!

95
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,470
Oars, don't!

96
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,670
You're an easy target for them
since you're so huge!

97
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,660
Ace-kun!

98
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,050
Here I come!

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,850
Oh no!

100
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,320
Stop him!

101
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,830
Oars opened up a space
for us to get into the bay!

102
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,190
Invade the bay!

103
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,770
Damn! Fall back and tighten
the defensive line!

104
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,480
Don't let them get to the plaza!

105
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,150
Wh-Where should we run?!

106
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,310
Stand back, Navy!

107
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,010
Don't get in my way!

108
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,360
Rear Admiral Yukimura,
the slayer of a thousand men!

109
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,180
What are you doing?

110
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,670
This is a battlefield!
We have no use for the unprepared!

111
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,470
I'm helpless!

112
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,870
I've never had to "look up"
to anyone before this!

113
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,250
Me neither!

114
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,960
I must reach Ace-kun!

115
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,250
Don't get in my way!

116
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,540
I'm not gonna let you go any further!

117
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,160
Vice Admiral Lacroix!

118
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,550
Oars, he'll never change.

119
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,000
Brave men don't seek death!

120
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,390
Pops, don't stop me!

121
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,720
I just wanna save him!

122
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,390
I just wanna save Ace-kun
as soon as possible!

123
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,240
I know that.

124
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,890
Everyone, help him!

125
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,060
Give Oars cover!

126
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,740
How can we defend against someone so huge?!

127
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,970
You cut Vice Admiral Lacroix!

128
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,140
You can't attack him alone!
We gotta do it together!

129
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,900
While Oars has you distracted,
we'll make our move against you!

130
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,450
Slave Arrow!

131
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,630
H-Hey, you guys!

132
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,840
So you're the Pirate Empress!

133
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,140
My body's... cracking!

134
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,400
Perfume Femur!

135
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,530
You bitch! You hit Navy soldiers, too!

136
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,040
I agreed to fight against Whitebeard but...

137
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,830
...I didn't say that I
will become a part of you.

138
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,460
Allies or foes--men are all the same.

139
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,360
Except for him.

140
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,640
Maybe just--"I have kept my word."

141
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,890
What?!

142
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,260
Have mercy on my beauty.

143
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,640
Y-You!

144
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,250
Ace-kun!

145
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,810
Come on! Come on now!

146
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,790
Oars!

147
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,570
Hey, you!

148
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,540
I'm gonna save you now!

149
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,510
Oars...

150
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,140
Ace-kun!

151
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,420
Ursus Shock.

152
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,350
Oars!

153
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,600
That's enough! Stop!

154
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,370
You can't reach me!

155
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,860
Hey, Oars!

156
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,590
I was just wondering...

157
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,680
Aren't you hot?

158
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,170
Because you're closer to the sun?

159
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,940
I'm hot.

160
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,750
I see.

161
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,560
It'd be nice if you had some shade.

162
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,110
Captain Oars!

163
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,980
Can he still move?

164
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,870
That's great!

165
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,920
He's got the toughness of his ancestor!

166
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,260
What's this?

167
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,510
I learned how to make it in the Wano Kingdom.

168
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,580
Try it on.

169
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,420
Ace-san ruined two others before that one.

170
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,780
They burned up!

171
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,150
Since his body's fire,
he shouldn't braid straw!

172
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,620
It's cool under here!

173
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,440
Yeah? That's good.

174
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Fire at Oars!

175
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,450
Oars!

176
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,850
He shouldn't have gotten off his knees!
He's a ready target!

177
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,200
Captain Oars! Why are you staying outside?

178
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,090
I don't get wet in the rain.

179
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,220
This is very sturdy!

180
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,460
I love it!

181
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,470
I still... can't get to him!

182
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,560
If I could...

183
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,490
...get one of The Seven Warlords at least!

184
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,940
What's the matter, beast?

185
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,710
My foot...

186
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,220
Captain!

187
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,450
Captain, why are you staying outside, again?

188
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,670
The snow's not getting on my head.

189
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,530
It's not cold!

190
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,980
I really love this!

191
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,240
Thank you, Ace-...

192
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,880
What fun!

193
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,960
Oars!

194
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,490
H-He must be a monster!

195
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
He stepped into the plaza!

196
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,210
Just a little more...

197
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,680
Just a little more to get to Ace-kun!

198
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,230
Damn Doflamingo!

199
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,520
He cut this guy's foot off!

200
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,020
I already claimed his body!

201
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,700
Doppelman!

202
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,080
Get him!

203
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,780
Spiky Shadow Lizard!

204
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,360
Oars!

205
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,270
I'm gonna... save you now...

206
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,100
Ace-kun!

207
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,560
Oars laid his life on the
line to clear a path.

208
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,100
The Whitebeard Pirates
rush to the scaffolding,

209
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,100
but just when it looks like they
can rescue Ace from execution,

210
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,370
Sengoku is already formulating a new plan.

211
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,140
On the next episode of One Piece!

212
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,020
"Justice for the Winners!
Sengoku's Strategy in Action!"

213
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
