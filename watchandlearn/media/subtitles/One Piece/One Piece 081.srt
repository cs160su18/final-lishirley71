00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,060
Please help my friend.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,160
Please call a doctor.

23
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,490
I haven't told you my name yet. I'm Dalton.

24
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm the captain of the
security squad of this island.

25
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,160
There's only one doctor here, and she
lives in the castle on the mountain.

26
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,120
Why in the heck would she
live someplace like that...?

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,170
I'm counting on you, Captain.

28
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,750
I can't believe it!
Like captain, like navigator!

29
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,530
All right, then, let's go...
before Nami dies.

30
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,840
What?! Don't say things
that could jinx us!

31
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,440
So these're Lapins?!

32
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,720
Whoa... Wapol-sama...

33
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,480
What!

34
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,820
We've finally returned...

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,150
to our home, Drum Island!

36
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,400
"Are You Happy?
The Doctor Called Witch!"

37
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,240
Ahh...

38
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,090
Nami?

39
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,320
Nami-san!

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,460
We have to... hurry to Alabasta...

41
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,420
Never mind that, just rest.

42
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,180
Don't worry about anything right now.

43
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,430
When her own life is at risk...

44
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,380
Nami-san, hang in there
just a little longer.

45
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,580
We have to go to that castle
where the doctor lives.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,070
Get out of our way, you damn bunnies!

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,330
They're coming!

48
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,020
Yeah!

49
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,180
Listen, Luffy!

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,860
Hm?

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,620
Don't you dare fight.

52
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,940
Why not?

53
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,610
Idiot! Whether you attack or get struck,

54
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,100
Nami-san will feel the whole impact too!

55
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,380
She'll die...

56
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,750
What?!

57
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,850
O... Okay! I won't fight!

58
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,470
B-but, what do I do?!

59
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,710
Just dodge! Dodge, dodge, dodge and run!

60
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,110
But don't retreat!

61
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,480
That's hard!

62
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,700
Flanchet Shoot!

63
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,080
Dammit! In this snow,
I can't kick properly!

64
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
They're all attacking at once!

65
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,710
Go into the forest!
I'll cover your back!

66
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,810
Okay!

67
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,430
Go left! We'll head to the mountain!

68
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,240
Got it!

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,590
We'll shake them off somehow!

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,790
It'd take us until night
to finish fighting them!

71
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
These snow mountain
animals really are tough!

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,780
We're at a disadvantage.

73
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,940
Don't!

74
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,560
Idiot! I told you not to attack!

75
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,580
Just leave them to me!

76
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,680
Sorry...

77
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
This isn't a joke!

78
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,950
Sanji! We can go up from here!

79
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,550
Good! Go on ahead!

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,920
Heave-ho!

81
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,600
--They're coming!
--You don't need to egg them on!

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,720
Anyway, run! To the top of the mountain!

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,510
It's getting strong...

84
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,680
Nami-san, please be okay...

85
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,940
Who in the world are you guys?

86
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,690
Who are we...?

87
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,140
It's too reckless for just the 6 of you

88
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,050
to travel in the Grand Line
without a doctor.

89
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,560
We're pirates.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,550
That's why you guys
pointed guns at us, right?

91
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, we may be a small group...

92
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,060
but as long as I, Brave Warrior
of the Sea, am with them,

93
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,830
there's no need to worry.

94
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,870
I see...

95
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,170
But it's true that we do want a doctor.

96
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,010
I was hoping to find someone
like that on this island, but...

97
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,800
I didn't expect that there was only one
doctor, a witch living in that castle...

98
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,550
It's a strange combination...

99
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,890
It seems that you guys're different
from the pirates that we think of.

100
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,870
Dalton-san!

101
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,610
Dalton-san!

102
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,460
Gotta bow...

103
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,980
Oh, hi.

104
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,000
I heard that you're looking for Dr. Kureha?

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,100
Yes, that's right, but the
sick person has already...

106
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,250
I heard that she's in our neighboring town,

107
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,250
Cocoaweed, right now.

108
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,210
What?!

109
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,630
Then they passed each other?!

110
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,350
Hey, owner. We've had enough already!

111
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,430
Your kid's voice is so loud
that I can't stand it!

112
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,200
Ah, I'm sorry.

113
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,340
Hey, Tamachibi, what's wrong?
Does it hurt somewhere?

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,010
If you just keep crying,
I won't know what's wrong.

115
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,780
You're disturbing customers.

116
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,320
Tamachibi! Say something!

117
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,450
If you don't stop crying,
I'll lock you out!

118
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,740
--It's the witch!
--Shh! She can her you!

119
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
--Scary...
--Shh! She can her you!

120
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,460
She's with that creepy monster again...

121
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,420
Hey! That's enough!

122
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,550
Well well... What a mean father...

123
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,440
If a child keeps crying,

124
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,010
he's signaling that
something's wrong with his body.

125
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,440
Stay there, Chopper.

126
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,390
Sorry to interrupt...

127
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,860
Dr...

128
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,160
Are you kids happy?

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,410
Dr. Kureha!

130
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,290
My secret to staying young?

131
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,370
No! We didn't ask that!

132
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,870
I still can't believe
she's a 140 year old hag...

133
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm still 139!

134
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,720
Shall I make it better?

135
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,590
Hm?! Make what better?

136
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,970
He isn't sick or anything.

137
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,640
Are you... a doctor?

138
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,110
Well then, shall we go, Chopper?

139
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,070
Wait!

140
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,730
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

141
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,670
Since I heard that the doctor
came down the mountain yesterday,

142
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,040
I thought she wouldn't
come down for a while.

143
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,060
Don't worry about it.
It's not your fault.

144
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,100
The issue here is Luffy and
Sanji's abnormal physical strength.

145
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,870
Even if we go after them
in the snow mountain now,

146
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,760
we probably won't be able
to catch up with them.

147
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
If the witch is in the
town called Cocoaweed,

148
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,510
we should ask her to go back
to the castle immediately.

149
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,400
Yes, you're right.
We have no other choice.

150
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,180
Forgive us...

151
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,220
What?

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,760
Forgive this country that doesn't
even have enough doctors...

153
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,840
N-no... It's not something
you should apologize for.

154
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,920
She's right.

155
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,170
Let's hurry!

156
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,620
My hands... hurt...

157
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,250
Your hands, huh...? I see...

158
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,630
Then, how about now?

159
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,550
My leg hurts!

160
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,660
See? You forgot that
your hands hurt, right?

161
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,640
What'd you do?!

162
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,900
Are you happy? You're happy?

163
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,220
Good! Be good and quiet.

164
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,120
Hey!

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,350
Don't yell. I just touched his leg lightly.

166
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,710
I heard a terrible noise.

167
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,560
He's got pains in his hands and legs.

168
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,990
He doesn't seem to have a fever,

169
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,450
but the swelling on his leg
is due to purulent inflammation.

170
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,280
It's pretty bad.

171
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,080
The bone has been infected.

172
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,680
Chopper, give me antibiotics.

173
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,420
Doctor... will my son be...

174
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,890
The key to cure this disease
is the initial treatment.

175
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,470
Don't worry. He'll be cured...

176
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,730
although he almost died...

177
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,920
What?! Almost died...?!

178
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,030
I'm going to do a little
operation on you, so be patient.

179
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,030
Hey, can't you at least use anesthesia?

180
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,900
Here is the shot.

181
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,180
Don't be reckless!

182
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,440
Well then... since my
medicine works well,

183
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,650
this is it for the treatment.

184
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,190
All you have to do is make sure he rests
well and keep his legs bandaged tight.

185
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,720
Yeah...

186
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,710
Once you immobilize his legs,
cool them well. Got that?

187
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,580
About the fee, well...

188
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,700
I'm almost out of
trash bags and toilet paper.

189
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,470
Also all the plum wine and
the food you have... And...

190
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,890
I'll take 50% of this restaurant's assets.

191
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,430
What?!

192
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,180
Chopper... take them to our sled.

193
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,560
Wha...?! Hey, that's outrageous!
Half of the assets?!

194
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,130
Hey, owner! Don't be fooled!
That's a rip-off!

195
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,020
It must be!

196
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,110
He almost died?!

197
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,150
Wasn't he really just
crying because he fell?!

198
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
How dare you abuse your
position as a doctor!

199
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,220
He's right!

200
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,610
You're a terrible person!

201
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,830
Don't take advantage of
people's weakness, you witch!

202
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,040
Stop it, Chopper.

203
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,140
It's just the blabbering of a bunch of kids.

204
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,830
Old lady...

205
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,960
I feel a lot better.

206
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,430
Thank you!

207
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,380
Oh...? I got a good tip.

208
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,330
I'll reduce the fee to 49%.

209
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,440
I'll pay you. Thank you.

210
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,360
Ahh...! Hey, kid.

211
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,240
Hm?

212
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,950
Don't forget... the happiness
you feel right now, okay?

213
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,370
Okay!

214
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,160
It's ice-cold!

215
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,160
My body is becoming numb...
it's like I'm trapped in ice!

216
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,830
Seems like I've still
got a long way to go.

217
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,850
If I suppress my 'self', even fire should
be cool and ice should be lukewarm.

218
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,440
Hey, Karoo! Come along with me!

219
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,580
This is an ideal way to strengthen
your inexperienced body!

220
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,600
I didn't expect to see this many fish.

221
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,760
I guess I'll go for another dip.

222
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,850
Are they coming?

223
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,850
No, they aren't.

224
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,700
All right! Looks like we lost them.

225
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,740
No... not yet.

226
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,610
Hm?

227
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,530
They're persistent!

228
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,660
What're they doing?

229
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,420
Are they irritated because they're hungry?

230
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,240
No...

231
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,100
Hold on a sec...

232
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,440
Don't tell me... they're...!

233
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,480
You...

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,610
Who are you?

235
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,220
You don't look like an ordinary villager.

236
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,910
The way you speak...

237
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,320
sounds to me like
someone from the military.

238
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,880
I was... a subordinate of...

239
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,760
the ex-King, Wapol...

240
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,820
What?!

241
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,300
I was the captain of this country's
security squad since the previous king.

242
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,570
However, when the king died...

243
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,380
and his son, Wapol, became the king,

244
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
this country changed.

245
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,700
Oh, yeah! I've thought of an
interesting law today again!

246
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,290
I'll exile all the doctors!

247
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,330
What?!

248
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,030
Exile them?!

249
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,280
Doctors?!

250
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,600
That's right.

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,210
I'll keep just 20 superior doctors
and make them my private doctors.

252
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,330
I christen them the "Twenty MDs"!

253
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,710
The "Twenty MDs"?!

254
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,380
That's right, the "Twenty MDs."
We'll exile the other doctors!

255
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,580
That's our great Wapol-sama!
That's a wonderful idea!

256
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,470
No...!

257
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,260
If you do such a thing, who'll see
our people when they get sick?!

258
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,680
You think their sickness
has anything to do with me?

259
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,480
Those who want to see a doctor

260
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,580
will have to prostrate
themselves before me!

261
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,610
There's no one whose family
members don't get sick.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,950
There'll be no one who can go
against me in this country!

263
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,410
Am I a genius or what?!

264
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,980
Then those who became
sick had no choice

265
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,170
but to ask for Wapol's mercy
in order to see the Twenty MDs?

266
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,710
Yes, and pay excessive medical fees...

267
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,390
It's the same as ruling the country by
taking the citizens' lives hostage...

268
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,040
That's not governing...!

269
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,680
It's a crime...

270
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,620
Just as I thought... There's no mistake...

271
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,040
Ahhh... dammit!

272
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,360
I got carried away and swam too long!

273
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,880
Where am I? Where's the ship?

274
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,670
Geez... I can't tell where
I am with all this snow!

275
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,560
Ahhh! I'm saved!

276
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,410
Hey, old lady! Sorry to bother you,

277
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,760
but will you take me
to the nearby village?

278
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,480
Huh?

279
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,450
What're you doing showing your
belly in this damn cold weather?

280
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,090
What a weird old lady...

281
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,490
Hm?

282
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,000
Be careful what you say.

283
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,210
I'm still in the youthful 130s!

284
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,340
Let's go, Chopper. We don't have
time to bother with a weirdo.

285
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,710
Wait, you hag!

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,290
What the hell was that
stupid old hag's problem?!

287
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,930
Whoa, it's cold...

288
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,840
Damn! I'll be in trouble
if I don't do anything...

289
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,400
I guess I'll do muscle training or
something to warm my body up for now.

290
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,030
We're here! We've finally returned
to my country, the Drum Kingdom!

291
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,480
Humph, having watchmen
as if they're a military...

292
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,620
What on earth were they thinking,
shooting at us...?

293
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,920
Hm?

294
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,100
Oh, my dear Drum Island!

295
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,500
Great nature that towers majestically!

296
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,780
Chess, is the castle all right?

297
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,720
Yes sir.

298
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,340
It's in a good shape,
just as we left it, Wapol-sama.

299
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,980
Then on to the castle!
Let's go back to the castle!

300
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,140
I'm done being a pirate!
I'm going back to being a king!

301
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,870
Now, go forth, Robson!

302
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,930
Huh?

303
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,970
Hey, Robson! What're you
just standing here for?!

304
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,880
Now, get moving already!

305
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,180
Wapol-sama! There's a problem!

306
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,860
What's the matter?

307
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,630
The ship...

308
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,650
of the pirates from the other day
is at the riverbank!

309
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,220
What?! Those bastards...

310
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,360
Why are those Straw Hats in my country?!

311
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,270
How dare they just come waltzing in
here when they said they didn't know!

312
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,220
Go flying!

313
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,290
Does he realize what I had
to go through after that?!

314
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,440
Hey! Go over there and
kill them all already!

315
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,050
Well, actually, the ship is empty!

316
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,810
What?!

317
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,870
We don't where they went!

318
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,940
Do you wanna be executed?!

319
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,680
I'm sorry, Wapol-sama.

320
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,820
Please forgive this clumsy subordinate.

321
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,870
Hmm... Chess, Kuromarimo...

322
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,760
The two of us inspected the
footprints coming out from the ship.

323
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,310
It looks like they headed to Big Horn.

324
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,580
I see... You guys're geniuses.

325
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,340
Then we'll first fire a salute in Big Horn

326
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,870
to celebrate the restoration
of the Drum Kingdom!

327
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,310
What?! What did you say...?!

328
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,880
They've already left this town?!

329
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,740
And just a moment ago?

330
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,920
For crying out loud!

331
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,380
She healed my sickness earlier.

332
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,560
Are you looking for
the doctor, Dalton-san?

333
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,900
We've got an urgent case.
Do you know where she went?

334
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,590
If you're looking for Dr. Kureha,
someone said she headed to Gyasta.

335
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,690
Gyasta?

336
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,800
Where is it?

337
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,890
With Big Horn being the middle,
it's in the other direction from this town.

338
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,180
We passed each other, too?!

339
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,560
It's a town where ice-skating is popular.

340
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,180
--Well, it's got nothing to do with this.

341
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,490
--Oh...
--Well, it's got nothing to do with this.

342
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,250
--Oh...
--And we didn't ask, either!

343
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,750
--Calm down, Usopp-san!
--And we didn't ask, either!

344
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,390
--Calm down, Usopp-san!
--Yes ma'am.

345
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,820
--In any case, let's head there.
--Yes ma'am.

346
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,230
Now that we've come this far,
we haven't a moment to lose.

347
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,680
Yeah, you're right.

348
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,090
Dalton-san...!

349
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,620
There you are...

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,110
Aren't you supposed to stand watch today?

351
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,480
What's the matter?! What's going on?

352
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,340
How did you get injured so badly?!

353
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,540
All the watchmen except me...

354
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,760
were killed...

355
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,480
What?!

356
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,230
Suddenly... a submarine
sailboat appeared...

357
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,090
and they killed everyone...!

358
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,340
Who do you mean by "they"?
Calm down and explain.

359
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,690
Dalton-san! Help!

360
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,630
We're not strong enough...

361
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,180
If we don't do anything...

362
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,520
What's going on?

363
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,570
So it's them?

364
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,650
It's Wapol! Wapol came back!

365
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,210
What did he just say?!

366
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,410
Wapol?!

367
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,520
Is that true?!

368
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,040
Hey! Dalton-san!

369
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,040
I'll settle this...!

370
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,010
I don't intend to bring about justice...

371
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,520
since you and I are both equally guilty!

372
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,940
Just wait... Wapol!

373
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,630
Those damn bunnies...
have really done it...!

374
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,790
This can't be happening...

375
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,380
Hey, Sanji. What's the matter?
What the heck is going on?

376
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,100
Hey... we're gonna run, Luffy...

377
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,930
What? Run? Where to?

378
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,340
Doesn't matter where! Someplace far!

379
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,130
An avalanche is coming!

380
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

381
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,480
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

382
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

383
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

384
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,420
So even,

385
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:37,580
if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

386
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,730
the ship will continue forward

387
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,880
Bon voyage!

388
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,000
Forget about them!

389
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,930
I know I'm a fool, but I gotta go

390
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:57,560
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

391
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,260
I know I'm a fool, but I'm gonna fight

392
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:11,280
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

393
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,630
Do everything you can,

394
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,630
and you'll get a little nearer to any horizon

395
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,640
Doctor! Where's the doctor?!

396
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,520
Luffy, hurry! We need
to get as high up as we can!

397
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,890
Ahhh! They're following us!

398
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,930
I wonder if Dalton-san is okay.
Can he take on Wapol and his men alone?

399
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,270
Whoa! What's that sword?!
He's pretty good!

400
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,630
On the next episode of One Piece!

401
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,270
"Dalton's Resolve!
Wapol's Corps Lands On The Island"

402
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
