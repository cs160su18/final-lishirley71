00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,530

WE GO!

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,150
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,480
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,150
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

71
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,020
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he

72
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,670
ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,960
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

76
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,880
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training.

77
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,380
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

78
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,720
they reached to the Fish-Man Island located
10,000 meters below sea level.

79
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,420
However...

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,390
The pirate boy with a straw hat!

81
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,060
Throw him out of this country!

82
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,200
A human with a straw hat on...

83
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,450
At Straw Hat Luffy's hands... at his
hands... the Fish-Man Island will be...

84
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,960
...destroyed!!

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,970
"The King of the Fish-Man Island!
Neptune, the God of the Sea!"

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,890
Guys! Hurry up-chin!

87
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,320
Quiet! Stay quiet!

88
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,240
We're in trouble if they notice.

89
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,070
Now is the chance! Get on the ship-chin!

90
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,320
Everybody, grab an oar and be ready!

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,750
THE FISH-MAN DISTRICT "NOAH"

92
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,550
Hurry up! They'll come
after us at any minute!

93
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,760
I'll never return to the Fish-Man Island!
Hurry up and cross the Red Line!

94
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,350
Damn! The Mermaid Cafe of my dreams!

95
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,730
I wanted to take one look
at the beautiful Mermaids!

96
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,900
Let it go, you idiots! Shut your
mouths and just keep rowing!

97
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,110
Damn! What a disaster!

98
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,830
As soon as we got away
from the sleeping Kraken,

99
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,120
we were surrounded by...

100
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,670
A PIRATE FROM THE SOUTH BLUE "CRAB-HAND" GYRO

101
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,210
...so many sea monsters at
10,000 meters below sea level

102
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,670
and couldn't even fight back!

103
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,510
Should I enlist under the
Fish-Men's banner or die?

104
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,930
I had no choice but to enlist
under their banner for a while!

105
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,930
How absurd!

106
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,940
Why do we humans have to enlist
under the Fish-Men's banner?!

107
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,780
Oh, we're moving away from the Mermaid Cafe!

108
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Stop crying and let's go, guys!
We are lucky to even be alive!

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Huh? They escaped?

110
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,540
Yes, Boss. As soon as my back was turned.

111
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,590
Did they escape again-dosun?
They never learn, don't they-dosun?

112
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,430
Humans always escape.

113
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,350
Should I bite off their flesh?

114
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,480
What a pain in the butt-ch!

115
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,770
No problem!

116
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,480
We can make them an example as always.

117
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,650
THE CAPTAIN OF THE NEW
FISH-MAN PIRATES HORDY JONES

118
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,120
Then I'll go get them-ch!

119
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,450
No, you won't, Ikaros.

120
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,580
Much, yes sir!

121
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,660
I'll go!

122
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Huh?

123
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,170
Get the bubble ready!

124
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,640
You can't take that much at once!
That's the power drug!

125
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,440
Now here we are!

126
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,160
This is my house!

127
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,000
It's huge!

128
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,500
Welcome home, Master-sama!

129
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,800
Hey, that's Monsieur Pappagu!

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,550
--You mean that really famous guy?!
--Wow! Is it really him?

131
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,430
Oh, you're popular, huh?

132
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Yeah! Are you guys surprised?!

133
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,150
When I'm in the water, I'm just a...

134
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,860
...fashionable starfish but...

135
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,950
...on the Fish-Man Island, I'm the president

136
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,830
and a very popular designer
of the Criminal Brand Co.

137
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,290
The brand is known all over the world now

138
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,250
and we have stores in many countries!
Even the famous Doskoi Panda is...

139
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,890
Oh, look at that! What is it?

140
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,760
Are you listening, Straw?!

141
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,390
--The 1st floor is a Criminal store.
--Oh!

142
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,260
Camie... Camie...

143
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,810
--Let's go there!
--Uh-huh!

144
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,640
Hey!

145
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,350
Listen to my story...

146
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,610
Whoa, Miss, that's impossible!

147
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,280
What is it?

148
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,450
A shop assistant sounds troubled.
A complaint?

149
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,490
As I said, the clothes
here are too expensive!

150
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,980
They're cute but...

151
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,200
That must be...

152
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,870
So let's make it 10,000 berries.

153
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,750
That's too cruel, Miss!
It's less than half price!

154
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,420
It's her as I thought.

155
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,880
Hey, Nami!

156
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,050
--Luffy!
--Nami-chin!

157
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,300
Camie!

158
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,220
It's been a while! How are you?!

159
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,760
Fine!

160
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,390
Hey, what's going on?

161
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,980
Oh, Monsieur Pappagu,
you came at the right time!

162
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,690
We have a troublesome customer.

163
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,280
Hey, so you own this store, huh?

164
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,570
Why is everything so expensive?
Are you ripping me off?

165
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,200
Monsieur!

166
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,700
Well, that's what they call brand

167
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,450
equity because I'm a popular designer...

168
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,580
--Give me a discount!
--No, you...

169
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,170
We're friends, aren't we?

170
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,840
I owe you guys big time from 2 years ago!

171
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,550
It's all free! Take as much as you want!

172
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,760
Free?! Really?!

173
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,730
--Guys! Let's not show mercy!
--Yeah!

174
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,140
Thank you!

175
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,440
Monsieur! They took everything!

176
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
You're so merciless!

177
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm happy for you, guys!

178
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,720
Oh? What is it?

179
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,370
Something's going on outside the store.

180
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,080
Monsieur! Th-This is serious!

181
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,700
What is it?

182
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,380
I-I-It's him!

183
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,250
Him?

184
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,760
It's him!

185
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,260
It's him!

186
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,760
Look! There in the air...

187
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,390
He came from the palace!

188
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,230
Jamon! Jamon!

189
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,230
Jamon! Jamon! Jamon!

190
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,190
What is it? A whale?

191
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,340
Why did he come down to the lower world?

192
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,920
This is the first time
I've seen him in person!

193
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,430
What's this about?
He doesn't even have guards.

194
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,220
This can't be happening!
He's never travelled like this!

195
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,560
Something wrong with the kingdom?

196
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,400
He doesn't bother coming down
here unless there is a problem!

197
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,780
Who is that old man?

198
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,910
Idiot, don't you know who
he is? That man is...

199
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,620
...the king of the Ryugu Kingdom
on the Fish-Man Island -

200
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,830
Neptune-sama!

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,550
THE KING OF THE RYUGU KINGDOM
NEPTUNE THE GOD OF THE SEA

202
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,550
Neptune!

203
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,590
Whale!

204
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,590
HOE (A PET WHALE)

205
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,470
That's a big Merman there...

206
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,760
I prefer Mermaids...

207
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,020
Cut it out, guys!

208
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,600
He's a very hairy old man!

209
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,020
That's rude! Get down on your knees now!

210
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,480
The whale's cute!

211
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,150
--He came to see those humans?
--He personally came for that?

212
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,870
Hey, Megalo! Are you sure that
it was these people-jamon?

213
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,960
Oh? We saw that shark in the water!

214
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,170
Yeah, the one with clothes!

215
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,840
He had been captured by Surume!

216
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,720
You Straw Hat people.

217
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,190
Wh-What do you want?

218
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,650
I'm going to...

219
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,050
...invite you to the Ryugu Palace-jamon!

220
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,390
What?!

221
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,140
Ryu-Ryu-Ryu-Ryu-Ryu-Ryugu Palace!

222
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,980
Ryugu Palace?

223
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,960
THE RYUGU KINGDOM CORAL HILL

224
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,750
MADAM SHARLEY'S HOUSE

225
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,750
Good! Your pulse is getting back
to normal. You should be fine now.

226
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,680
You have to thank those
two for donating blood.

227
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,140
Those two...

228
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,470
It's okay, silly!

229
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,730
If you want, we can give you more, silly!

230
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,190
I thank them but I wanna forget about them.

231
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,230
I'm so glad!

232
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,400
It'd be crazy if you died

233
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,830
from loss of  blood before
you saw Nami and Robin again!

234
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,620
Nami-san...

235
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,790
Robin-chan...

236
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,290
Oh no! Sanji is in danger!

237
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,710
Hey, come here! Splash! Splatta!

238
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:09,220
What is it? Do you need our blood again?

239
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,890
If it's so, just tell us! You can have...

240
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,100
...As much as you want!

241
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,140
You have to stay calm, silly!

242
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,400
We'll stay here and...

243
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,320
...Take care of you!

244
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,070
No thank you!

245
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,450
--Don't be shy!
--Stay calm - it's bad for your health!

246
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,450
You two are the worst for my health!

247
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,160
--So shy!
--Stay away!

248
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,120
Be patient, Sanji!

249
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,000
Go away, fools!

250
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,250
Ryu-Ryu-Ryu...

251
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,550
Ryu-Ryu-Ryu...

252
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,090
Ryugu Palace?!

253
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,050
That's right-jamon!

254
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,220
What?!

255
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,750
I can't believe they're invited
to the palace...

256
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,770
Who are those humans?

257
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,310
King Neptune came to pick them up himself...

258
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,520
They know Monsieur Pappagu!
Maybe they're famous...

259
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,860
--Look, there's Soul King!
--Yeah!

260
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,030
What's the Ryugu Palace?

261
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,830
Idiot, don't you know what it is?!

262
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,620
I'll tell you.

263
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,630
It's pretty much a holy
place for us citizens.

264
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,800
A celestial world where
ordinary people are not allowed!

265
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,550
The Ryugu Palace is...

266
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,060
...the place where King Neptune,
the Neptune 3 prince brothers,

267
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,600
and the Mermaid Princess live - it's...

268
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,940
...The royal palace of the Ryugu Kingdom!

269
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh...

270
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,980
Camie, again!

271
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,570
Hmmm... So, old man...

272
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,530
Don't call him that!

273
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,780
Is there a lot of good
food at the Ryugu Palace?

274
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,490
Straw!

275
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,080
Of course. We are prepared
to have a banquet-jamon.

276
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,330
Oh yeah? I can't wait!

277
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,780
I'd like to see the Ryugu Palace!

278
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,350
My heart is filled with expectations.

279
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,340
But I don't have a heart to be filled!

280
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,180
I wanna go too!

281
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,680
Ryugu Palace! I sense treasure!

282
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
I knew that'd be what you're interested in!

283
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,560
Okay, let's go!

284
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,250
Hmmm. Alright, Megalo,

285
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,200
give the Straw Hat
people a ride to the Ryugu Palace-jamon.

286
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,870
Can I get on?

287
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,750
Wow! Cool!

288
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,500
Are we gonna meet the Mermaid Princess?

289
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,050
I can't wait!

290
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,380
What are you doing? Come with us!

291
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,890
Huh? Well, we don't deserve to
go to the Ryugu Palace... Right?

292
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,640
Stop grumbling and come!
Let's have a banquet!

293
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,440
--You can't say goodbye here!
--Is it okay, grandpa?

294
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,730
You can't say "grandpa"...

295
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,440
Your friends can come-jamon.

296
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
Hear that? Grandpa,
you're an understanding person!

297
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,540
Like I said, that person is...
You guys... really... please!

298
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,210
Alright, let's go!

299
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,380
To the Ryugu Palace!

300
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,340
Hurry up, hurry up!

301
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,550
Go faster-chin! They'll come any minute!

302
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,850
It's hard to catch a current in the deep sea!

303
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,020
This is why we should've
put paddle wheels on!

304
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,650
You know, the New World is...

305
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,110
Captain! Look!

306
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,610
There's something in front of us!

307
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,240
That's...

308
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,240
Hordy Jones!

309
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,460
N-No way! He found us!

310
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,540
What? He has...

311
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,720
What the...? He has handcuffs on.

312
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,140
No way! He's gonna fight us, isn't he?

313
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,430
He vanished!

314
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,230
Where did that bastard go?!

315
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,240
What?! What happened?!

316
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,420
We've taken damage!

317
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,290
He's too fast!

318
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,860
He's here on the ship!

319
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,280
Take him out! He's the only enemy!

320
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,120
No way! It didn't work!

321
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,420
I fought a Fish-Man before!
I've been through hell to get here!

322
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,130
You're only a fish - Don't
mess with humans, you fool!

323
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,720
Captain!

324
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,430
Dammit!

325
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,450
Boy, what we got is a hell of a thing-ch!

326
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,660
The power drug - Energy Steroid!

327
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,920
Fish-Men were born to be 10
times stronger than humans.

328
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,710
But once we take one Energy Steroid,
our physical strength will double.

329
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,840
20 times stronger than humans.

330
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,260
If we take 2, it'll double that!

331
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,260
This dream power will shorten our lives!

332
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,480
But we're not afraid of dying
- we just adhere to the plan!

333
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,360
--Wh-What is he doing?!
--What is he gonna do with the mast?!

334
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,700
Is that why he has those handcuffs!

335
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,370
He wants to show us that he can sink
us without even using his hands!

336
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:58,080
Humans killed Fisher Tiger
and shattered Arlong's dream!

337
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,300
The dark and tragic history
of the Fish-Men will end now...

338
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,470
...with the help of us,
the New Fish-Man Pirates!

339
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,650
Take them to the New World
and set them adrift.

340
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,910
Oh no! You didn't kill all of them, did you?

341
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,410
No, I need them alive.

342
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,830
You humans, survive with cuts and
bruises to show the people on earth...

343
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,300
...what happened to you in the sea.

344
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,720
And who you met.

345
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,180
Tell them how horrendous it was.

346
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,560
We'll capture the center of
the world, the Fish-Man Island,

347
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,140
from the gutless God of the Sea - Neptune

348
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,440
and drag you humans down
to the dark sea bottom!

349
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,030
You'll all learn that the
Fish-Men are the supreme race!

350
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,750
At the king of Fish-Man Island, Neptune's invitation,
Luffy and his crew make their to a banquet at the Ryugu Palace.

351
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:33,220
However, Luffy's hunger gets the better of him and as soon as he smells food,

352
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,560
he separates from the group.

353
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,640
Luffy then and discovers a gigantic tower locked with a door stuck with swords and axes!

354
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

355
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,820
"The Ryugu Palace! Taken by
the Shark that They Saved!"

356
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
