2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,430
"Hot Water"

39
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,990
--Catch!
--That was too high!

40
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,600
Here I go!

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,660
I'd like a Rainbow Rock.

42
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,320
I'll get right on it.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,780
Yeah, I'd like to give it a shot.

44
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,160
This is awesome!

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,460
It's hard to believe this resort was
just outside the Florian Triangle.

46
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,780
I know!

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,260
I am honored that you
are enjoying yourselves.

48
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,820
Spa Island has twelve heated pools.

49
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,060
--You're lovely!
--There are three lazy rivers...

50
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,650
Incoming!

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,460
...and a pool dedicated to diving.

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,500
We also have waterfalls for
meditation and fifty baths,

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,340
including a cola bath and a milk bath.

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,400
"Milk Bath"
"Women" "Men"

55
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,530
Furthermore, we have water ping pong

56
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,410
and a floating casino for those
who would like to play games.

57
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,970
You can enjoy exquisite cuisine prepared
by master chefs at several restaurants.

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,120
As your host, nothing could make me happier

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,090
than to melt away the fatigue
from your long voyage.

60
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,550
Some lucky visitors may even get to
see a circular rainbow and candy rain.

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,590
Oh, aren't circular rainbows

62
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,890
a rare natural phenomenon
called the "ocean's treasure"?

63
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,350
But I've heard there hasn't
been a sighting in years.

64
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,010
As I said, "some lucky
visitors" may see them.

65
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,860
Is something the matter?

66
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,860
We might see some candy rain in just a bit.

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,840
Eh?!

68
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,490
Surely you jest!

69
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm sure it must be difficult
to run a resort on these waters.

70
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,230
Since our opening, we've earned
10 billion Berries a year.

71
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,270
We're endorsed by the World Government,
so we haven't run into any problems.

72
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,930
Our security is rock solid.

73
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm confident that our

74
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,100
regular guests have nothing to
fear as they kick back and relax.

75
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,930
10 billion Berries a year?!

76
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,060
Naturally, that applies to pirates as well.

77
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,400
Thanks for your hospitality.

78
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,020
I'm sorry if that spoiled your mood.

79
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,650
As long as you're a paying customer,

80
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,100
I don't care if you're a pirate or
part of the Revolutionary Army.

81
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,190
You two are rather similar.

82
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,410
10 billion Berries! Berry, Berry, Berry!

83
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,060
"The Slow-Slow Menace!
'Silver Fox' Foxy Returns!"

84
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,370
Ready, go!

85
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,350
Boo-yah!

86
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,020
--Whoopee!
--Yeah!

87
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,590
Huh? What are those things?

88
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,550
Candy! It's raining candy!

89
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,060
Candy ball raindrops!
And they're only raining here.

90
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,980
Talk about lucky!

91
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,000
We're super lucky! Lucky!

92
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,530
Candy too heavy!

93
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,110
Stupid!

94
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,710
You guys are so stupid!

95
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,310
Huh?

96
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,220
What is that?

97
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,130
This is the ocean raccoon dog, Nukki.

98
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,050
He can transform into anything!

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,690
Wow, awesome!

100
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,030
He said that this girl is called Rina.

101
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,370
The raccoon dog talked!

102
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,830
I'm not a raccoon dog! I'm a reindeer!

103
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,930
Eh?

104
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,330
"Eh?" Be nice!

105
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,250
Are you hungry?

106
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,160
Yeah...

107
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,020
Want my lunch? But it's not a pirate lunch.

108
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,820
Huh? You're pirates?

109
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,260
Honest?

110
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,670
I'm Luffy, the man who will
become King of the Pirates!

111
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,540
I'm the ship doctor, Chopper!

112
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,310
I'm Captain Usopp, the sniper.

113
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,740
Wow! I didn't know there were
funny pirates like you guys.

114
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,160
Thank you! Now to chow do--

115
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,500
Huh? What's wrong?

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,000
I forgot about my big sister.

117
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,050
Your sister?

118
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,510
Big Sis Sayo!

119
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,110
You're eating up a storm!

120
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,420
This guy will eat anything.

121
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,280
Ocean raccoon dogs are omnivores.

122
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,000
Think he'll eat this?

123
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,240
Of course not!

124
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,290
What is that?!

125
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,170
What?! He can transform into anything?

126
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,880
Pretty much.

127
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,890
A babe! Please transform
into the hottest babe ever!

128
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,360
Ah, if only I was better with words!

129
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,830
Transform into Nami-san!
Please turn into Nami-san!

130
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,540
You're puny!

131
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,340
I am a stinking idiot!

132
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,760
But even if you're puny,
Nami-san is still Nami-san!

133
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,130
Nami-san!

134
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,220
Jerk!

135
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,160
See? Aren't they goofy?

136
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,270
Are you going already?

137
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,110
Uh-huh.

138
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,580
Thank you for the feast!

139
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,080
Oh, are you leaving?

140
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,950
Yes. Thank you for the meal.

141
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,750
Are you all right?

142
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,460
I had a blast! Thank you, Luffy.

143
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,810
Aw! Is the ocean raccoon dog leaving already?

144
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,710
That's who you'll miss?!

145
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,390
I've been looking for you two.

146
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,910
This is getting old!

147
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,780
I didn't expect you to get this far.
Your drive is impressive.

148
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,530
I'd love to catch you here and now,
but that'll have to wait.

149
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,360
I've run into some rather familiar faces.

150
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,460
You're doomed now that
I've run into you, Straw Hat!

151
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,120
It's been a while, hasn't it?

152
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,250
Who are you?

153
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,340
He doesn't know who I am...
He doesn't remember!

154
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,670
Oh, no! Boss! Don't let it get to you!

155
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,890
By any chance, are you...

156
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,770
...the guy that Zoro and Sanji beat up?

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,320
He's doing it on purpose!
It has to be intentional!

158
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,460
Boss!

159
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,360
Hey! Straw Hat, you jerk!

160
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,950
You tarnished my undefeated legacy

161
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,490
"Fox"

162
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,860
and stole our pride--our Jolly Roger!

163
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,490
Don't tell me that you've forgotten!

164
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,740
Ah! Now I remember.

165
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,680
You're Split-Head Fox!

166
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,870
I'm "Silver Fox" Foxy!

167
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,410
Luffy, be careful. As I recall,
he can shoot a weird beam.

168
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,410
Really?

169
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,630
Hey, he isn't much of a threat
if we know what's up his sleeve.

170
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,620
Don't expect me to rely
on the same tricks forever!

171
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,850
Look!

172
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,310
A mirror?

173
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,330
High-Speed Rotation Mirror Ball Amplifier!

174
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,230
Thousand-Armed Kannon, Slow-Slow Beam!

175
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,550
--Shoot!
--That's against the rules!

176
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,610
Darn... it...

177
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,760
I... told... you... so!

178
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,680
Anything struck by my beam is
slow for thirty seconds afterward.

179
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,540
I'll be taking this.

180
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,110
Now do you remember me, Straw Hat?

181
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,670
You'll start to fall in ten seconds!

182
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,670
Nine!

183
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,590
Eight!

184
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,760
Seven!

185
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,530
What a lovely bath.

186
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,070
It made my skin so smooth. It's great!

187
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,200
But I'm a skeleton, so I don't have any skin.

188
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,810
What are you guys up to?

189
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,740
Franky! Brook! Beat them up!

190
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,880
Weapons Left!

191
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,300
What's going on?!

192
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,590
Luffy?!

193
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,540
Cien Fleurs!

194
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,110
Thank you, Robin-chan!

195
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,280
I owe ya!

196
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,690
Is everyone okay? Gosh, you scared me.

197
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,360
You're amazing, Luffy!

198
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,410
Yeah, I'm a rubber man. I won't
let that Slip-Head defeat me!

199
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,830
Damn it! You've added new
members to your crew, Straw Hat!

200
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,210
B-Boss, they have a skeleton!

201
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,920
Shoot! Let's try again!

202
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,280
Victory is mine as long as
I have this mirror ball.

203
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,550
Stupid! What are you doing?
Shut the door already.

204
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,610
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

205
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,000
I swear I'll get him!

206
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,480
Please remain calm!

207
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,190
"Hot Water"

208
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,420
Why is everyone leaving?

209
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,990
I'd like to ask you two something.

210
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,130
Wh-What?

211
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,440
It's about that notebook.

212
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,610
Foxy and his goons are after it, aren't they?

213
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,430
Foxy?

214
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,800
The pirates from earlier.

215
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,020
Sure, we have a history with them,

216
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,310
but I'd say they were more
interested in your notebook.

217
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,590
I called it, didn't I?

218
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,990
This notebook explains how to create jewels!

219
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,360
How to create jewels?!

220
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,560
--Rina!
--It's okay. Leave this to me.

221
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,240
Huh?

222
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,400
It's true that they're pirates, but they
seem trustworthy. Plus they're strong!

223
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,380
If we try to deal with this on our own,
we may never reach our goal.

224
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,930
You see, this notebook
belonged to our father.

225
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,770
Oh, wow! It's full of numbers!

226
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,550
Our father is an inventor, and those
formulas explain how to make jewels.

227
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,230
You can read this?

228
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,890
Big Sis Sayo can. It goes right over my head.

229
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,630
Really? You're something else, Sayo-chan!

230
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,660
What about this? He included
a nautical chart...

231
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,800
It has a hot water mark and an "X."

232
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,480
That's his secret message.

233
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,110
We think it's a hint regarding
how to make jewels.

234
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,740
Huh? This?

235
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,050
The formula for making
them is about 99% complete.

236
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,220
And he hid the remaining 1% in this clue.

237
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,910
Right.

238
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,590
Could the hot water mark
mean a hot springs...?

239
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,190
In which case, the "X" might mean Spa Island.

240
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,330
Yep. We reached the same
conclusion and snuck aboard.

241
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,530
Impressive!

242
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,070
But despite all of our searching,

243
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,360
we can't find anything to indicate
we're on the right track.

244
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,330
I doubt that notebook alone could
tell you how to make jewels...

245
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,140
But the Foxy Crew has come this
far in pursuit of that notebook!

246
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,290
It might be legit.

247
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,880
It might be fake.

248
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,000
Huh?

249
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,930
Rina!

250
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,380
I'm sure it's fake.

251
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,630
There is no way you can make jewels!

252
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,350
What?

253
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,820
My father is a stupid liar!

254
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,410
He is really stupid!

255
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,440
I hate my father!

256
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,480
"Rina and Sayo's Village
-Three Years Ago-"

257
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,590
Dad!

258
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,540
Welcome home.

259
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,600
Sayo! Rina! This is horrible!

260
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,420
What is?

261
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,500
It's a golden beetle!

262
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,200
L-Legend says that our village
will perish when one appears!

263
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,790
What should I do?! What should I do?!

264
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,030
Dad...

265
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,400
The paint is coming off.

266
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,780
He fell for it!

267
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,620
What an idiot!

268
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,160
Scram!

269
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,160
I can't believe them!

270
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,030
What a relief! Thank goodness!

271
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,750
Huh?

272
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,030
Well, isn't this great?
The village isn't doomed.

273
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,920
Isn't it wonderful that it was a prank?

274
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,010
Our father loved our village.

275
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,080
He loved it because that was
where our mother was born.

276
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,870
My research can save the entire village.

277
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,750
Everyone will be able to live in comfort.

278
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,400
What type of research
are you conducting, Dad?

279
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,200
Jewels! How to create jewels!

280
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,300
Jewels...? Those aren't
something you make, Dad!

281
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,520
Your dad sounds neat!

282
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,610
He isn't the least bit neat!
He's a horrible father!

283
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,280
Three years ago, he went on a journey
for his research and never came back.

284
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,190
He abandoned us!

285
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,250
It's been just the two of us ever since.

286
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,420
We've had to grit our teeth
as everyone made fun of us.

287
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,700
"I don't have a dad. He's dead!"
That's what I've told myself.

288
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,140
But then a month ago...

289
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,460
Nukki suddenly came back
with this notebook in his mouth.

290
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,300
There was a letter in the notebook.
What do you think it said?

291
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,220
"Dear daughters.
Please complete my research."

292
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,550
Can you believe him?

293
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,950
He was so busy with his research that
he forgot about us for three years!

294
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,960
Why must we risk our lives and
travel to these dangerous waters?!

295
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,550
He's stupid! Stupid!
I don't believe a word he says.

296
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,800
He's fudging over his lies about
the jewels with this picture.

297
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,300
Why did he give us this quiz at the end?!

298
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,600
Your dad really is neat!

299
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,560
Huh?

300
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,900
I wanna see those jewels.

301
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Did you pay attention to a word I said?!

302
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,740
Ah, there you are!

303
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,620
You're late, Zoro!

304
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,700
Hey!

305
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,390
But didn't you come to
search for the treasure?

306
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,660
I didn't--my sister did!

307
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,170
I'm her bodyguard.

308
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,590
Her bodyguard?

309
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,970
My sister was insistent
about searching for the secret,

310
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,760
so I came to protect her.

311
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,780
What are you guys doing?

312
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,680
I am certain that there
is a way to make jewels!

313
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,940
I believe in him.

314
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,860
Big Sis Sayo...

315
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,290
Everyone, please help--

316
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,170
Big Sis Sayo!

317
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,340
I've got the girl. If you want
her back, do as I say!

318
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,500
Doran?!

319
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,120
Who is that?

320
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,290
The ship's host.

321
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,600
What?!

322
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,890
I'd like you to uncover the secret
behind that notebook.

323
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll return the girl in
exchange for the answer.

324
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,330
Shoot! Foxy wasn't our only enemy!

325
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,290
What should we do, Luffy?

326
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,380
Please, Rina! Finish the research.

327
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,590
Don't let Dad's dream fall
into the hands of that jerk!

328
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,230
Dad's research was nothing but lies.

329
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,820
I can’t believe Sayo got caught
because of his notebook!

330
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,350
Please, Luffy! Save Sayo!

331
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

332
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,400
"The Great Scramble for Treasure!
Collapse! Spa Island!"

333
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
