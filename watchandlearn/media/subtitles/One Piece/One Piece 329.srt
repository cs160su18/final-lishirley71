2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,490
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,670
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,390
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,810
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,190
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:55,570
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,540
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,000
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,250
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,010
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,600
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,110
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,570
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,830
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,130
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,460
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,840
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,390
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,600
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,140
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,850
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,480
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,110
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,320
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,480
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,610
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,950
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,330
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,660
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,710
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,130
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,220
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,870
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,910
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,440
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,910
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,030
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,540
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,690
Find it!

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,260
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,510
The Straw Hat crew
encountered the Accino Family

50
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,020
in the ice-enclosed ocean, the Arctic Path.

51
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,310
We finally found you!

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,080
Dearies, now that you've
wandered into the Arctic Path,

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,610
you'll never get to see
the open ocean ever again.

54
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,320
Say your prayers!

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,650
Meanwhile, Luffy and Chopper
tried to return to the Sunny

56
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,870
after treating Puzzle's wounds, but...

57
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,210
The Sunny is gone!

58
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,430
In order to escape from
the surrounding icebergs,

59
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,760
they tried to blast free with the Sunny.

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,430
Coup de...

61
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,660
...Burst!

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,860
But the Accino Family implemented
a certain plan to foil their escape.

63
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,280
Why not get the flag first?

64
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,460
A strange fish?

65
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,590
"The Assassins Attack!
The Great Battle on Ice Begins"

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,720
Our Jolly Roger...

67
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,490
It's gone missing?

68
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,530
When'd that happen?

69
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,940
Wh-Where'd it go?

70
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,450
It's gone!

71
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,820
Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone!
Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone!

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,540
Go, my kite, Uo!

73
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,550
What's up, Nico Robin?

74
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,230
It couldn't be...

75
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,080
Huh?

76
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,870
Is something over there?

77
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,430
Found it!

78
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,310
Jolly Roger, found!

79
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,340
Where?!

80
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,560
A bird-like fish has it!

81
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,000
I thought so.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,790
What?!

83
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,470
The people we saw earlier
have stolen it from us.

84
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,710
What?!

85
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,620
I saw one of them issue that fish an order.

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,310
Hey!

87
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,000
It's taking our Jolly Roger back
in the direction we just came from!

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Damn it!

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,790
Sanji-kun?

90
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,670
Hey, where do you think you're takin' us?

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,470
Isn't it obvious?

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,680
We're going back!

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,770
What?!

94
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,700
Don't be stupid!

95
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,270
We just escaped.

96
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,030
Calm down, Sanji-kun!

97
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,020
We're still missing both Luffy and Chopper!

98
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,240
Yeah, and Zoro!

99
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,650
At times like this, you should
think before you leap!

100
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,380
Hey, you!

101
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,580
Quit moving!

102
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,120
Hey, I said to quit moving!

103
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,840
C'mon!

104
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,950
Freeze!

105
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,420
We can't afford to stay put.

106
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,230
A Jolly Roger is as important
to a pirate as his own life!

107
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,710
We can't allow even one to get stolen!

108
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,770
We know that, but first we
should meet up with Luffy--

109
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,170
I've got another reason!

110
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,390
Guys, do you want our captain
to scold us for screwing up?!

111
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,880
I can't believe you guys!

112
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,290
Really!

113
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,280
No!

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,460
Anything but that!

115
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,920
I couldn't take it!

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,310
My pride won't let me endure
a lecture from that moron!

117
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,390
Dang...

118
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,300
Those two...!

119
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,590
Okay!

120
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,540
Let's go!

121
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

122
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,430
Crap!

123
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,400
Not again.

124
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,450
How can they move?

125
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,510
They're just ice!

126
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,380
It looks like we can't get any further

127
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,290
until we learn the truth
behind these icebergs.

128
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,030
Franky!

129
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,510
Yeah?

130
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,750
I'd like to borrow something.

131
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,250
The punks!

132
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,620
Where did they go?!

133
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,110
I, Hockera-sama, will find them first!

134
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,900
Just you wait and see!

135
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,420
Lan la-lan la-lan!

136
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,780
We really don't have time for this, Honey!

137
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,980
We need to hurry and find those pirates!

138
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,980
Don't be in such a rush, Darling!

139
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,130
No matter how hard they try,
there is no escape from the Arctic Path!

140
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,900
Indeed, it's impossible!

141
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,020
Nice!

142
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,530
That expression was nice!

143
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,740
Honey, you're the best!

144
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,430
But it's strange how we haven't found
them despite all of this searching.

145
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,080
I wonder what rock they're hiding under...

146
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,450
Soldier Dock System, Channel 3!

147
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,730
Shark Submerge III, take off!

148
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,480
Well?

149
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,420
How does it feel inside
my Shark Submerge III?

150
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,800
Ain't it super?

151
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,770
Sanji-kun, do you copy?

152
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,260
She blew me off...

153
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,920
I read you loud and clear, Nami-san.

154
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,510
So?

155
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,140
Have you learned anything yet?

156
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,980
It looks like we'll have
to dive a bit deeper...

157
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Franky, please take us
directly under the icebergs.

158
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,010
Sure thing!

159
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,900
Huh?

160
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,050
What's that?

161
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,620
What is it, Nami-san?

162
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,620
Did you find something?

163
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,580
Please slow down a bit.

164
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,030
Stop right there!

165
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,090
What is that...?

166
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,940
They noticed us!

167
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,000
What did?

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,060
I don't know!

169
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,270
What?!

170
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,300
They're headed straight for us!

171
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,670
What are?!

172
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,940
Just get us outta here!

173
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,970
Whoa! Whoa!

174
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,900
Wh-What's going on, Nami-san?

175
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,900
Crap! Crap! Crap!

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
What's going on?!

177
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,530
Go faster!

178
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,930
Darn it!

179
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,630
Nami-san!

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,670
Nami-san!

181
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,690
D'oh!

182
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,350
Crap!

183
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,280
What was that?

184
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,920
Found 'em!

185
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,810
Let's go.

186
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,370
Wait for me, Honey!

187
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,810
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

188
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,170
That hurts!

189
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,710
We must have fallen from up there...

190
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,780
Dang!

191
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,580
If it isn't a cute penguin.

192
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,080
Penguin!

193
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,130
Pen-pen!

194
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,690
Penguin!

195
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,340
Youch!

196
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,080
Hey, look.

197
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,860
It's a penguin colony!

198
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,380
Wh-What should we do?

199
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,250
What type of question is that?

200
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,720
Our only option is to run!

201
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,940
Damn it!

202
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,500
What's with these birds?!

203
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,390
Someone please tell me!

204
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,890
Please save me!

205
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,650
Help me!

206
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,820
Sweet!

207
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,330
Now I can get back.

208
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,560
Savage Penguins?

209
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,360
Yeah.

210
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,490
They're a violent breed of
penguin that inhabits these parts.

211
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,130
They're what has been moving the icebergs.

212
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,360
Awesome!

213
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,850
The bounty hunters use them to
round their prey into one area.

214
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,760
That is why it's said there is
no escape from these waters.

215
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,700
Got it.

216
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,850
Hey!

217
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,450
Chopper, we're going back to the Sunny!

218
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,600
Y-Yeah!

219
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,610
Thank you for everything.

220
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,390
Later!

221
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,400
H-Hey!

222
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,150
Let him go.

223
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,120
It's all the same, no matter where he goes.

224
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,270
On the ocean, there is no
defying fate.

225
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,210
Isn't that right?

226
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,460
Thanks for having us!

227
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,420
Later!

228
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,230
What is it?

229
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,430
What's this?

230
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,340
And here I'm sure you told me he was dead...

231
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,330
It's an honor to meet you in person,
Puzzle the Phoenix.

232
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,180
We managed...

233
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,710
to get away...

234
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,750
What the heck were...

235
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,830
those birds?

236
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,670
Lan la-lan la-lan!

237
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,310
Lan la-lan la-lan!

238
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,720
I-It's the couple from earlier...

239
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,530
I swear, you certainly are stupid.

240
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,970
Didn't I warn you that there was no escape?

241
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,270
Yahoo!

242
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,590
It's an honor to see you once more!

243
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,650
As a sign of our growing closer...

244
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,810
Don't get near me!

245
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,160
Dang, that was close!

246
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,900
Oh?

247
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,120
Would you like to fight a round?

248
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,620
I see you're halfway decent.

249
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,120
But you're doomed now that we've found you!

250
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,840
This is the end of the line.

251
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,410
Nice!

252
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,190
You sounded so cool, Honey!

253
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,190
Thank you, Darling!

254
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,500
Not in front of me!

255
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
Hey, get away from her!

256
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,460
Kissy!

257
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,460
Mr. Ugly!

258
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,230
Quit kissing right in front of me!

259
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,230
Guys, you're so annoying!

260
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,530
I thought I was gonna die!

261
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,540
That was a nightmare!

262
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,170
What now?!

263
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,330
Show yourself!

264
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,360
I've finally found ya!

265
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,640
Who're you?!

266
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,700
I'm Hockera, the third
boy in the Accino Family!

267
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,380
You're going to be my presents to Papa!

268
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,290
Presents to Papa?

269
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,340
What're you talking about?

270
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,220
Take this!

271
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,730
I'm gonna put you on ice!

272
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,320
Franky!

273
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Bring it on!

274
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,410
If you're looking for a
playmate, I'm game, kiddo!

275
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,740
Let's play, Miss!

276
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,270
Who are you?

277
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,370
I am Lil.

278
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,650
So?

279
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,560
Will you play with me?

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,540
Do you think the Sunny is okay?

281
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,420
Sure!

282
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,490
There's nothing to worry
about with them around.

283
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,620
By the way, do you know which
direction I'm supposed to be rowing?

284
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,240
Nope!

285
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,620
We were the ones in a bind!

286
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,850
It's pushing us back where we came from!

287
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,480
Whoa! Whoa!

288
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,340
What?!

289
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,640
What gives?!

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,180
It looks like you live up to your
reputation as the "Phoenix."

291
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,390
But I'm afraid you'll be
stripped of that title today.

292
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,370
P-Please wait!

293
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,070
Y-You must be mistaken!

294
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,810
This isn't our captain.

295
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,370
This is just a worthless
crewmate who got injured.

296
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,900
Our captain died a long time--

297
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,440
How dare you bastards try to trick us?!

298
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,290
I should teach you a lesson!

299
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,460
Stansen!

300
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,320
What's going on?

301
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,810
What made that noise?

302
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, Stansen!

303
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,110
Are you okay?

304
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,900
Well?

305
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,320
Come out and say it!

306
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,530
Fess up that the useless man
over there is your captain.

307
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,070
Puzzle, I believe in you.

308
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,780
You are the man who will
become the King of the Pirates!

309
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,270
Hey, Vigaro!

310
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,350
Wait!

311
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,490
Captain, what are you doing?

312
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,910
Let that creep have it!

313
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,710
Go on, Captain!

314
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,980
That brat just let the cat out of the bag!

315
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,970
You're the captain of this ship.

316
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,910
In other words, you have
a 100-million Berry bounty!

317
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,170
Although it still stands to be
proven whether you're a man worthy

318
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,230
of such a bounty.

319
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,990
Captain...!

320
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,070
Captain!

321
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,710
Oh, yes!

322
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,000
What happened to Straw Hat?

323
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,330
He was supposed to be here.

324
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,380
Are you also hiding him somewhere?

325
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,220
Well?

326
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,750
Out with it!

327
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,110
Stansen!

328
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,540
Stansen!

329
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,350
Captain, why?

330
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,590
Go back to the way you used to be!

331
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,550
Please!

332
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,550
Come back to us!

333
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,880
Damn it...!

334
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,330
Hey!

335
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,400
We came back.

336
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,750
Incoming!

337
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,850
What's that?

338
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,310
Sorry!

339
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,900
Could you give us a lift after all?

340
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,030
S-Straw Hat?!

341
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,610
Didn't you return to your own ship?

342
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,110
Ow...

343
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,120
An iceberg forced us back.

344
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,040
And I didn't know which way to go!

345
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,100
D-Didn't they think of that before they left?

346
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,460
Dunno...

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,010
That hurt...

348
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,710
Whoa!

349
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,040
True, it must be terribly difficult to find

350
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,870
a pirate ship that has lost its mark.

351
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,930
Eh, Captain Straw Hat?

352
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,010
But today is my lucky day!

353
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,320
To think I ran into two
wanted men at the same time!

354
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,900
You mean three.

355
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,400
And who are you?

356
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,450
Your luck bites.

357
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,660
I am Blend-sama, the second
son in the Accino Family!

358
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,160
Hey, geezer!

359
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,240
What happened to you?

360
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,330
Listen to me!

361
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,350
You see, that flag of yours has been
added to our family's collection.

362
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,090
Your collection?

363
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,560
We stole your pirate flag of
a skull wearing a straw hat.

364
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
What about a flag...?

365
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,910
Th-They stole our Jolly Roger, too.

366
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,240
I don't know if it's your symbol or
your cymbal, but you're not all that great

367
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,520
if you've got something that easy
to steal out on display, Straw Hat.

368
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,460
Hey, if you know how to
pick a fight with a pirate,

369
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,370
then you're prepared to face one, right?

370
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,920
Where is our Jolly Roger?!

371
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,130
Your Jolly Roger should be
in Lovely Land by now.

372
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,090
If you want it back, I dare you to go get it.

373
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,760
Lovely Land?

374
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,360
It's freezing!

375
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,910
What... is that?

376
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,880
You jerk!

377
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,980
Your "Boho boho" is getting old!

378
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,830
Give our Jolly Roger back!

379
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,550
That flag--our Jolly Roger--
represents our pride as pirates!

380
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,510
We can't let you keep it!

381
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,690
Wait, damn it!

382
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,260
Luffy, watch out!

383
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,730
You're gonna fall!

384
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,490
On the next episode of One Piece!

385
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,190
"Desperate Battles for the Straw Hat Crew!
Pinning Their Pirate Souls on the Flag"

386
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
