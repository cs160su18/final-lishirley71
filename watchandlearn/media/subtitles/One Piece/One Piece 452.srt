2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,830
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,950
Luffy has made it aboard a Navy ship
in order to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,820
who has been taken to the Navy HQ!

52
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,700
There is nothing but despair ahead for you!

53
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,500
You can't get away no
matter how you struggle!

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,790
Can't you see that it's no
use? For pirates like you...

55
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,250
...The Gate of Justice won't open!

56
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,470
Are you sure about opening the gate?

57
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,050
Warden Magellan!

58
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,720
Bon-chan is...

59
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,000
It's me!

60
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,110
Bon-chan!　Bon-chan!

61
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,940
Bon-chan, the gate's closing.

62
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,780
We...

63
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,900
...have to go.

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
Thank you!

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,910
--The gate is closing!
--We gotta sink them!

66
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,580
Do you wanna say something before you die?!

67
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,370
This is what I wanted!

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,340
Luffy has broken out of the world's
greatest prison Impel Down!

69
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,060
But the end is nowhere in sight...

70
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,160
"To the Navy Headquarters!
Off to Rescue Ace!"

71
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,160
Why do you want to live so dangerously?

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,320
If I hadn't come here with an antidote,

73
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,750
LEVEL 4 BURNING HEAT HELL

74
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,080
you guys would be dead.

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,580
You can't underestimate Magellan.

76
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,590
But we're alive!

77
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,520
The fact that you came down
here is a part of our fate.

78
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,390
But you're right! I thought
I was going to die!

79
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,810
We are...

80
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,020
...lucky.

81
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,480
Whether you die or not--it's up to God!

82
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,200
Those who harbor fear will lose!

83
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,620
We just need to live in the moment!

84
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,290
Don't we, Shiryu?!

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,430
I'm grateful for your
help! You have my thanks!

86
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,810
And again, welcome to our gang! I think
that we're gonna make a great team!

87
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,480
My future here is predictable.

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,900
I've been waiting to meet someone like you.

89
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,620
THE SHIP ROUTES OF THE WORLD
GOVERNMENT TUB CURRENT

90
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,700
All right, everyone!

91
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,710
Let's toast to our unprecedented
unheard-of breakout of Impel Down!

92
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,290
--Cheers!
--Cheers!

93
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,510
--Cheers!
--Cheers!

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,640
Oh, that's good!

95
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,610
We'll have to do it without
Inazuma from here.

96
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,370
What?! The infection is really that bad?!

97
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,660
I was infected with just
one kind of poison and...

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,660
...got it out of my system using my
Healing Hormone and Energy Hormone.

99
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,210
Heehaw!

100
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,520
But it's complicated because...

101
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,550
...one will take years off my life but
the other causes severe side effects!

102
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,060
It's better if he can rest
and recover naturally.

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,560
Nothing can help you to regain
years lost by using the hormone!

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,020
Inazuma is an indispensable New
Kama of the revolutionary army!

105
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,370
We shouldn't allow him
to push himself too hard!

106
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,750
When I think about it, he
wasn't a bad guy after all.

107
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,610
I was looking forward to seeing him again...

108
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,360
But once more, he rushed to our aid!

109
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
Bon-chan!

110
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,220
--Brother Bon!
--Bon-chan!

111
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,600
Bon-chan!

112
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,700
Hey, how long are you gonna
mourn like that, guys?!

113
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,830
He was great but he's dead
and nothing can't change it!

114
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,450
Let's just party!

115
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,320
It's a breakout party!

116
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,170
Oh yeah, let's celebrate it
as a funeral for Mr. 2...

117
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,680
I knew I'd fall into the red!

118
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,100
We don't know if Bon-chan's
dead yet, you, big nose!

119
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,640
What did you just say?!

120
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,060
Your nose is red, round and stupid!

121
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,280
Well, your face is rubbery,
stretchy and stupid!

122
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,030
What'd you say?!

123
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,240
I couldn't care less about them...

124
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:29,720
I thought that talking to fish was
the special ability of Mermaids only.

125
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,420
But you can call out to sharks, too.

126
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,760
Is it so weird for a Fish-Man
to be a friend of fish?

127
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,220
Well, I can say that it's not normal.

128
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,120
I guess that you're a misfit...

129
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,680
...of the violent species.

130
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
I take it as a compliment.

131
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,110
I can't deny the fact that
Fish-Men are violent.

132
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,860
Bon-chan's not dead!

133
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,910
Oh! Captain Buggy grew another red nose!

134
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,450
Luffy-kun.

135
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,040
You gave me an opportunity to save Ace-san.

136
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,960
I owe you a great debt.

137
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,830
Don't think of it in terms like
that. There'd be no end to it!

138
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
For me, it's just encouraging to
have you along! You're so strong!

139
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,730
I want to thank you and apologize
to you for the other case before this.

140
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,360
But, not today. There is
something more important now.

141
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,150
You can call me Jimbei!

142
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:42,620
I'm a Warlord but I'm sure
they'll revoke my title!

143
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,200
So let's run wild at the Navy Headquarters!

144
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,580
We have to live up to the expectations of...

145
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,960
...that Queer-kun and rescue
Ace-san at any cost!

146
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,720
--A Warlord?
--The Navy Headquarters?

147
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
What?!

148
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,760
Hey you! You're a Warlord?!

149
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,470
No wonder you're so strong!

150
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,690
Sorry that I hadn't introduced myself yet!

151
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,650
Everyone else knows that.

152
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,440
Hey! What's that about
the Navy Headquarters?!

153
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Don't tell me that we're heading
to the Navy Headquarters!

154
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,660
--Yes, we are!
--No!

155
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,330
I know that you guys know about the
war between Whitebeard and the Navy!

156
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,330
--What'd you say?
--The Navy HQ?

157
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,880
It's obvious. It's your faults
for being so clueless.

158
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,840
What?!

159
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,510
We passed through the Gate of Justice.

160
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,890
That means our destination must be
either the Navy HQ or Enies Lobby.

161
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,570
The Tub Current that we're on
is exclusive to the Government.

162
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,230
It's a giant whirlpool that connects
the Government's 3 major facilities

163
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,860
We wanted to break out because
we have a role in the war.

164
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,450
Yeah! The real fight is on its way!

165
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,990
"The real fight is on its way?!"

166
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,910
W-We didn't know about this!

167
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,790
--Stop the ship right now, you bastard!
--Stop!

168
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,790
We can't stop because we are on the current!

169
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,130
Why don't you guys get off?!

170
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,420
--Okay, bye!
--Yeah, bye!

171
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,300
No, we can't!

172
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,260
Devil Fruit eaters
like us will definitely be killed!

173
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,600
The Navy HQ and The Seven Warlords
versus the Whitebeard Pirates?!

174
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,390
That's more horrifying than hell!

175
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,870
I wanna go back to the prison
rather than entering this war!

176
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,480
Us from the Kama Land knew it.

177
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,630
Why didn't you tell us then?!

178
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,010
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

179
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,010
We can't escape death this time!

180
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,990
Mom!

181
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,910
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

182
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,760
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

183
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,570
Hey, do you hear something?

184
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,280
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

185
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,480
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

186
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,760
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

187
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,840
--It's a Transponder Snail!
--Who's calling?

188
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,260
Don't you get it? This is a Navy ship!

189
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,170
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

190
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,030
Why don't we just pretend we're not here?

191
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,700
--Clank!
--Hello?

192
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,110
He picked up!

193
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,120
This is the Navy HQ.

194
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,030
Oh, this is Luffy.

195
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,120
Don't give your name like that!

196
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,620
We know that the ship has
been taken by escapees.

197
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,540
We received a report from the
Fleet Escort Force at Impel Down.

198
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,510
We determined who the two main suspects
of this great escape case were...

199
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,590
...from the insider information
before contact was lost.

200
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,300
Two?

201
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,430
A pirate--Straw Hat Luffy!

202
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,270
And another pirate Buggy the Clown!

203
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,810
-- What?!
-- W-What?!

204
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,770
No way!

205
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,400
Captain Buggy is the main suspect
although there're Warlords here?!

206
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,490
Who the hell are you?!

207
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,200
Why me?!

208
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,660
--Let me see the documents.
--Here you go.

209
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,790
We thought that you were
just a nameless pirate.

210
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,630
Buggy the Clown, I can't believe that...

211
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,550
...you were a crew member under
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

212
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,760
How'd you know that?

213
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,590
What?!

214
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,850
--"The ship" - that means Oro Jackson?!
--He's kick-ass!

215
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,890
He's a star! A star among pirates!

216
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,560
We also know that you're a sworn
brother of "Red-Haired" Shanks,

217
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,980
one of the Four Emperors.

218
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,570
What?!

219
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,990
How could someone like this
have laid low until now...

220
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,660
...without raising any alarms.

221
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,950
But now, you've made yourself known.

222
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,660
Well...

223
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,420
We can't see clearly your
connection with "Fire Fist" Ace

224
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,460
but we're sure that your goal is
the same as Straw Hat Ace's rescue!

225
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,340
Well... I don't really...

226
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,430
We know that you have
Jimbei, Crocodile, Ivankov,

227
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,350
and more than 200 ruffians who
are also escapees on board.

228
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
I warn you.

229
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,570
As long as we don't open the Gate of
Justice, you guys can't get to Marineford

230
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,110
or even get out of the Tub Current!

231
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,940
There is no sea for you all
to get away to or to live on!

232
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,160
Better make yourselves
comfortable! That's it.

233
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,330
Hey wait, Navy!

234
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,710
I'm gonna rescue Ace at any cost!

235
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,550
"Wash your potatoes" and be ready for us!

236
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,010
Potatoes?

237
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,020
Clank!

238
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,180
The expression should be "watch your neck!"

239
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,900
You don't wash your potatoes and
boil them at a time like this!

240
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,980
First of all, why did he try to
pick a fight with the Navy HQ?!

241
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,490
Wait, before that... Captain Buggy!

242
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,280
Were you really a member of the crew?!

243
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,740
And a sworn brother of "Red-Haired?!"

244
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,620
Our savior is a hell of
a pirate as we thought!

245
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,080
Oh, well...

246
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,750
Damn! If word gets around, the
Government will keep an eye on me!

247
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,340
So that's his background!

248
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
And yet, he's so weak.

249
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,180
With such a pedigree, how
could you be so dirty?!

250
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,520
So every ship has at least one blemish!

251
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,690
Shut up!

252
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,480
I didn't know that. But I remember...

253
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,610
Have you also heard of the East
Blue pirate known as Buggy?

254
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,070
The Vice Captain old man was saying that.

255
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,820
Huh? The Vice Captain?

256
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,620
The old man called Rayleigh,
I bet you know him.

257
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,410
What?! Have you seen Rayleigh-san?!

258
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,630
I miss Vice Captain! Where'd you see him?

259
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,550
They're talking about "Dark King"
Rayleigh! What a conversation!

260
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,180
Captain Buggy! I knew you were something!

261
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,890
No no, wait a second! It's all true but...

262
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,600
...if you spread this around, it'll
be bad for my future as a pirate!

263
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,730
It's amazing that you were the
member of the legendary pirates!

264
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,070
Buggy! Buggy!

265
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,030
H-Hey, you fools...

266
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,820
Stop it! I was an apprentice to be exact!

267
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,910
I don't want you to make
a lion of me with that...

268
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,580
Hey, you got the wrong idea!

269
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,340
Well, I don't feel so bad...

270
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,550
Oh yeah, wait a minute!

271
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,090
The Navy has overestimated me for
sure but it's not such a bad thing!

272
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,890
Yeah! Because it's all true!

273
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,060
I'm developing a reputation here!

274
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,560
If by some chance, I could...

275
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,640
If I could beat Whitebeard,
then I'd become the one of...

276
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,560
...the Four Emperors!

277
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,570
Oh no no no... I'd go way
beyond that and become...

278
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,580
...the King of the Pirates!

279
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,210
Yeah! These guys might have
higher bounties than me!

280
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,960
If I play my cards right...

281
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,610
...I can do this!

282
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,280
Captain Buggy! We'll follow
you the rest of our lives!

283
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,090
Give us an order!

284
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,600
Let's steal this ship from the ones
who want to go to the Navy HQ!

285
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,390
And then, we're gonna be free!

286
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,400
Well, Straw Hat! You need to
give over this ship to us!

287
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,720
After breaking out, we don't
wanna go to the Navy HQ!

288
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,950
We got Captain Buggy on our side!

289
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,230
Go ahead, Captain Buggy!

290
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,290
--Buggy! Buggy!
--This is no good.

291
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,000
It's better to just kill them all.

292
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,840
Yeah, I feel like I can do it!

293
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,900
Be quiet, you flashy fools!

294
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,820
You guys are all full of whim and fancy!

295
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,250
This ship won't stop!

296
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,620
We're
heading to the center of the war!

297
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,710
And you guys are already on board!

298
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,660
Brace yourselves and think about it!

299
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:16,000
Soon, the man at the top of the
world is gonna show up in our midst!

300
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,570
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

301
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,470
If you guys are real men, why don't
you live out a dream with me?!

302
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,920
Today...

303
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,350
I'll beat Whitebeard which means
that I'll conquer the world!

304
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,020
Yeah! Captain Buggy!

305
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,570
Captain Buggy!

306
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,070
We were devastated by the darkness of hell...

307
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,620
...And we almost lost the
most important thing!

308
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,040
Losing the jewels of our hearts
that we once had - called dream!

309
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,730
I will follow you!

310
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,920
I don't want a peaceful life!

311
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,590
That's right!

312
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,720
Let's go, guys! To Navy Headquarters!

313
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,640
Looks like it's over.

314
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,390
He has this kind of ability at least.

315
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,940
Captain Buggy! You should lead the world!

316
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,560
I'll follow you to the end!

317
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,940
Yeah, follow me!

318
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,240
I hope they are having fun.

319
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,200
The ship that carries Portgaz D. Ace
will arrive at Marineford shortly!

320
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,660
Here he comes, finally!

321
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,760
Relax and go on board!

322
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,240
There's room for everybody so don't worry!

323
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,680
Be prepared for the arrival!

324
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,660
NAVY

325
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,380
The sky island, Weatheria, still carrying
Nami, continues toward the Grand Line,

326
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,550
but it's traveling far too slowly.

327
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,600
Will Nami make it back to her friends?

328
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,680
And will Franky, now a gentleman,
ever return to his old self?!

329
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,050
On the next episode of One Piece!

330
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,020
"The Friends' Whereabouts! The Weatheria
Report and the Cyborg Animals!"

331
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
