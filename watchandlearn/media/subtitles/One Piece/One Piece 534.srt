00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

your toughness, that’s what it takes

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,880
Being brazen, is it a crime?

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

57
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,320
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,560
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,480
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,660
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,830
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

74
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,760
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training.

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,010
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

76
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,930
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level.

77
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,770
Go, Shark!

78
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,780
To the Sea Forest!

79
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:50,830
"The Ryugu Palace in Shock!
The Kidnapping of Shirahoshi!"

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,040
SOUTHEAST OF THE FISH-MAN ISLAND
IN THE DEEP SEA

81
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,840
Thank you for coming all the way to see me!

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Well, Tom-san told me that one of his family
members at home is also a shipwright, so...

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,720
But it must've been difficult
to come to the Fish-Man Island.

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,520
Difficult?

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,480
I was trained by Tom-san since I was a kid
and I came here with a ship that I made.

86
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,280
Since you were my brother's pupil,
I bet it's quite a ship.

87
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,530
Yeah, it's called the Thousand
Sunny and it's my masterpiece!

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,200
I would love to see it.

89
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,630
Well, after we entered the Fish-Man Island,
it was taken away by the tide.

90
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,630
That's part of reason that I came to see you.

91
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,430
I was wondering if you could give
me a clue as to Sunny's whereabouts.

92
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,390
You'll find it.

93
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,970
I hope so...

94
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,180
When a ship sinks in these parts,
it usually gets carried by the tide

95
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,940
and ends up at a certain place.

96
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,520
I think the Sunny will be there too.
Count on me, completely!

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,110
Completely, huh?

98
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,030
We'll get there soon.
The place known as the Sea Forest!

99
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,070
The Sea Forest?

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey hey, Luffy-san!

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,290
Hey wait, Megalo! Where are you going?!

102
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,960
Father-sama, Brother-sama,
everybody at the palace, please forgive me!

103
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,630
I am going out without permission!

104
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,180
I'll be home by dinner!

105
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,480
Let's go for a "walk"!

106
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,860
What is going on, Megalo?!

107
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,070
I can't believe he left the doors open!

108
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,740
What if something happens to...

109
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,200
Skeleton, hurry up!
See if the Princess is okay!

110
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,120
Hey! You're riding my bones too hard!

111
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,760
She's not here!
Princess Shirahoshi is not here!

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,430
What?! The Mermaid Princess is not here?!

113
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,220
This is bad! This is a matter of
great consequence to the kingdom!

114
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,230
When did this happen?! Who did this?!
She must have been kidnapped!

115
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,390
Kidnapped?!

116
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,690
Princess-sama!

117
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,820
Princess-sama...

118
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,610
She must've been kidnapped?

119
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,360
Hey, what are you doing?!

120
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,500
The gate that connects the Fish-Man
Island and the Ryugu Palace...

121
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
Where is the switch to open it?!

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,420
Huh? The switch?

123
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,960
Skeleton, hurry and go back to Neptune-sama!

124
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,550
We have to tell him what is going on here!

125
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,260
We have no choice but to do as we're told.

126
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,220
They told us the only way
we'll live is if we obey them.

127
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,440
Just tell us!

128
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,150
Who are "they"?

129
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,230
They're gonna kill us if you don't tell us!

130
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,190
Kill you?

131
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,780
Tell us!

132
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,150
I don't know what you're talking about!

133
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,200
A FEW HOURS AGO THE FISH-MAN DISTRICT "NOAH"

134
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,790
What a pain in the ass!

135
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,540
Humans are such lowly creatures -
they can't even breathe in the water!

136
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,760
Listen, you pirates under
the control of Hordy Jones!

137
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,060
You should all be happy! Because you
can be part of this historic mission!

138
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,400
That's Vander Decken
of the Flying Dutchman?!

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,610
The captain of the cursed ghost ship?!

140
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,990
Don't worry, I'm his descendant.
I'm not a ghost.

141
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,000
Though I am cursed as well. I can't
swim even though I'm a Fish-Man.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,880
I got this devil power alongside
of the Mark-Mark curse.

143
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,630
Let me show it to you!

144
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,930
Alright, you human right there! Step forward.

145
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,600
Huh?

146
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,850
Hordy!

147
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,690
Are you guys serious? Don't be crazy!

148
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,820
--It's Hachi-san!
--Hatchan-san!

149
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,910
--It's Hachi-san!
--It's Hatchan-san!

150
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,280
Hachi-san...

151
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,830
The Energy Steroids will
do nothing but ruin you!

152
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,710
What's the point of destroying the island?

153
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,670
Don't underestimate the
Great Knight Neptune!

154
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,710
Hachi-san, give me a break.

155
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,680
I don't want to hear your voice anymore.

156
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,640
I can't believe you were an officer
of the pirate group that I admired.

157
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,940
You became a coward.
It's time for a generation change.

158
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,730
To teach humans a lesson,
we need the Fish-Man Island

159
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,110
so Neptune is in our way!

160
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,490
You all taught us that
we're the supreme race!

161
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,990
But Arlong-san lost!

162
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,660
Decken! Hyouzou! Why are you doing this?!

163
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,840
You even refused
Arlong-san's offer back then

164
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,050
so why are you helping these youths now?!

165
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,140
Helping? I'm just in this for the money.

166
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,390
Arlong was stingy so he couldn't pay me much.

167
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,320
I felt sorry for him that he could only
take crappy swordsmen like you with him.

168
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,860
Hachi from the Arlong Pirates?
Oh, sweet memories!

169
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,450
Your captain even tried to make
me work under him at that time.

170
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,500
That was ridiculous!
I won't work under anybody!

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,630
Hordy understands that.

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,420
Arlong-san had a dream and an ability
to take action that I could respect.

173
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,970
But at the same time, he was too
rough and lacked cleverness.

174
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:33,190
When you guys were running wild on the sea,
we were all too young to become pirates.

175
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,360
We all witnessed what they did
so we plan things more carefully.

176
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,660
Because we've learned from
our predecessors' failure.

177
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,830
I will continue where Arlong left off.

178
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,500
As a member of the group I admired so much,

179
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,090
your opposition is so
discouraging, Hachi-san!

180
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:01,470
Straw Hat Luffy who shattered
Arlong's dream is here, by the way.

181
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,350
But you don't mind at all?

182
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,850
He called me his friend even though I'm
a former member of the Arlong Pirates.

183
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,150
All three of you are my friends now!

184
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,030
Plus, Straw Hat Luffy saved my life.
I wish I could go see him now but...

185
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,450
I'm too ashamed to face him when somebody
is trying to keep Arlong's dream alive!

186
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,330
How pathetic of you to
become friends with a human!

187
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm disgusted by you!

188
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,960
Lock on to you, Hachi!

189
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,470
You forgot how pirates do things?

190
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,980
If there is something to say,
you have to use violence!

191
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,230
I suspect!

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,310
Here!

193
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,900
Where is he throwing it?

194
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,780
When I touched you just now,
you became my mark.

195
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:07,120
No matter what I throw or where I
throw it, it's like a living bird,

196
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,910
it will strike you at full speed!

197
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,500
--The knife he just threw somewhere else...
--...Flew at the octopus Fish-Man!

198
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,010
Mark-Mark curse...

199
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,890
Of course, there are a number
of ways to defend yourself.

200
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,890
Give it a try.

201
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,020
No... You have so many arrows.

202
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,270
I knew about your power - I heard the rumors!

203
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,230
Hey, Hordy, he's trying to kill me!

204
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,820
Stop Decken!

205
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,650
As he told you, Hachi-san.
Vander Decken is not working under me.

206
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,910
We are allies on equal footing.

207
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,500
And you're annoying me anyway!

208
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,040
Coward!

209
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,420
Damn!

210
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,210
Alright, get him!

211
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,760
That's it! Run, run!

212
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,770
But they will chase you, chase you,

213
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,940
chase you and chase you
to the end of the world!

214
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,690
If I can get out of here...!

215
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,700
Yes, now I can get away!
In the water, arrows will...

216
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,330
Damn! They aren't even slowing down!

217
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,000
Stop following me!

218
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,710
I can have two marks - one for each palm!

219
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,090
I haven't washed my right hand for 10 years

220
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:35,600
ever since I touched Princess
Shirahoshi and designated her as my mark!

221
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Do you understand? It doesn't matter
if it's love or a weapon that I throw,

222
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,400
they'll both follow
until the furthest hell!

223
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
This is my power!

224
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,360
Awesome!

225
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,110
That's why he could continue
stalking her insidiously...

226
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,830
...without showing himself or
getting caught by Neptune's army!

227
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,370
That's right!

228
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,040
What a sinister guy!

229
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,370
Sinister! Sinister! Sinister!

230
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,040
Now you human pirates.

231
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,670
Now that you've seen Decken's power.

232
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,050
Here is the first stage of the mission.

233
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,770
They say the Ryugu Palace
is impregnable but...

234
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,270
...someone has been able to pierce
the defenses for 10 years

235
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,650
and that's him - Vander Decken.

236
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,790
So for this mission,
you'll be thrown by Decken

237
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,370
and fly to the Mermaid
Princess in the palace.

238
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,330
What?!

239
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,340
Where you'll be landing is the
solid wall of the tower though.

240
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,050
Then, open the gate from inside the palace

241
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,140
and let us in - that is your duty.

242
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,110
--No way! If we get thrown...
--...We could die from hitting the wall!

243
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,820
You're right!

244
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,400
That's why I want you humans to do it
because your lives aren't so important!

245
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,240
You humans are less
valuable than slaves here!

246
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,870
Those of you who survive hitting
the wall carry out your duty.

247
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,120
If you succeed it, I'll set you free.

248
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,380
If you refuse to do it, I'll kick
you out of the bubble right now!

249
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,130
You lowly creatures!

250
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,930
N-No way... If we leave the bubble,
we'll drown for sure!

251
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:40,890
In that case, you have no choice but wager
on the possibility you'll survive, right?!

252
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,940
Go!

253
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,950
Today, a new history for
the Fish-Men will begin!

254
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,290
First, we conquer the Ryugu Kingdom!

255
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,370
Yeah!

256
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,210
I'm coming to you soon, Shirahoshi!

257
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,720
THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE RYUGU PALACE
A PASSAGEWAY TO THE HARD SHELL TOWER

258
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,680
And now...

259
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,050
Wait!

260
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,180
No way!

261
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,060
Hurry up, Skeleton, get to the King!

262
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,810
Wait... We have to open the gate or...

263
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,440
...Hordy will kill us!

264
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,200
Hey, I have a question for you guys. Um...

265
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,530
Sanji, you have to stay in bed!

266
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,580
I mean, at that place called
the Ryugu Palace... Is she there?

267
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,660
You know, the Mermaid Princess!

268
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,170
S-She is there! So what?!

269
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,040
Then I'll go. Even if it kills me.

270
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,760
You're going?! You never learn!
If she's beautiful, you'll die!

271
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,050
Of course she's beautiful, isn't she?!

272
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,850
I've never met her but I
heard she's very beautiful.

273
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,850
So she's beautiful, just as I thought!

274
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,310
I'll go, I'll go, at any cost!

275
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,650
Now lead me to the Ryugu Palace!

276
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,780
--What's wrong with him?
--I don't know but we have to take him.

277
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,280
You need to be handcuffed if
you're going to the palace!

278
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,620
Do whatever you want as long as
I can see the Mermaid Princess!

279
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,870
Sanji!

280
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,580
No! Wake up!

281
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,160
Fools!

282
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,380
I can't cook for the Mermaid
Princess if you handcuff me!

283
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,630
That's the reason?!

284
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,170
I knew you were gonna resist! Cart them off!

285
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,680
You bastards wanna ruin my chance
to get close to the Mermaid Princess?!

286
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,350
Do you?! Do you?!

287
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,730
Hey, Sanji!

288
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:58,150
Oh no, you beat all the soldiers...

289
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,320
We didn't do anything wrong but now...

290
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,910
It's their fault - they tried to handcuff me.

291
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,750
--They're part of the Straw Hats...
--Dangerous people...

292
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,750
Look, everybody's looking at us coldly
like they're a bunch of deep-sea fish!

293
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,840
Stop complaining! What's done is done!

294
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,180
Think before you act!

295
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,760
You beat the half of them with kung fu!

296
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,810
You were pretty strong...

297
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,060
Don't try to compliment me, you bastard!

298
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,820
It's the voice of a lady!

299
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,480
There is a man covered
with blood at the shore!

300
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,280
You're the guy from the Fish-Man District!
What happened?

301
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,240
Call a doctor!

302
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,990
Huh? I am a doctor!

303
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,660
What? Hachi?

304
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,920
What happened to you?!

305
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,420
Hey, Hachi! It's us!

306
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,180
Why are you hurt?! What happened to you?!

307
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,050
Oh... It's you guys...

308
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,600
Good to see you... Is Straw Hat with you?

309
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,560
He's not here! Wait for a moment!
I'll treat you in a sec!

310
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,940
Summon all your friends... Hurry...

311
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,450
You guys don't wanna get involved...

312
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,950
...with this island! Get out of the island!

313
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,910
The New Fish-Man Pirates will
come and attack the island soon!

314
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,750
And the Ryugu Kingdom will... fall!

315
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,970
Neptune-sama!

316
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,350
There was a kidnapping!
Somebody kidnapped the Princess!

317
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,850
And pirates are falling like
rain at the tower! In any event,

318
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,270
they're your enemies! They're attacking!

319
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:01,530
Kidnapped?! Shirahoshi?! Who did it?!

320
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,490
Somebody's making a
raid now? What should we do?

321
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,370
Why now?!
We're occupying the palace ourselves!

322
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,160
Wh-What should we do?!

323
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,540
No, don't answer!

324
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,330
I'll cut them.

325
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,670
I said "Don't answer"!

326
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,260
In order for us to survive...

327
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,760
...We have to open the gate at any cost!

328
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,680
Th-They're here!

329
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,650
Why don't you come out of Shark now?

330
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,190
N-No, I'd rather stay in here still...

331
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,900
How do you like it out here after 10 years?

332
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,620
My heart is racing! This is very bad...

333
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,500
How can it be bad? You
just got out of the tower.

334
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,540
You're weird!

335
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,630
This is...

336
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,180
...what they call an adventure?!

337
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,760
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

338
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,100
If your heart is racing, that's an adventure!

339
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,650
Did you say "the Sea Forest"?

340
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,360
What is that? Something fun?

341
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,700
It's a graveyard.

342
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,990
There is a grave that I haven't
been to since they built it.

343
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:42,040
That is the place that I've wanted
to go to the most for 10 years!

344
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:49,470
THE SEA FOREST IN THE DEEP SEA

345
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,180
It's been 10 years already.

346
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,930
Since her assassination in broad daylight

347
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,720
which threw the Fish-Man
Island in an uproar.

348
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,520
Time flies.

349
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,070
Princes have grown into tough soldiers.

350
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,990
Princess Shirahoshi is still in the tower.

351
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,950
But nobody forgets your ideals.

352
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,540
Queen Otohime!

353
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,960
Hordy's plans for revenge are underway!

354
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,130
The pirates he has sent lay
siege to the Ryugu Palace,

355
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,130
and throw it into a state of panic.

356
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,760
The crew has been caught up in the attack,

357
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,470
and the once impregnable Ryugu
Palace gate is breached,

358
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,730
The New Fish-Man Pirates have arrived,
intent on destroying the kingdom!

359
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,070
"Hordy's Onslaught! The Retaliatory
Plan Set Into Motion!"

361
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
