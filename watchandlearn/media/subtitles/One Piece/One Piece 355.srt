2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,990
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,720
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,230
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,360
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,010
We swore to reunite with my crewmate
off some capes. His name is...

48
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,060
...Laboon!

49
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,630
Laboon...

50
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,900
Seriously?

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,030
It's him...

52
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,240
We know him.

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,200
We know that whale.

54
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,110
I had no idea one of the people
Laboon has been waiting for...

55
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,850
...was that skeleton!

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,030
I love that bag of bones
and that whale, dammit!

57
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,490
Shuddup!

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,850
Now I'm getting excited!

59
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,420
He's a musician, a talking skeleton,
has an afro, goes "Yo ho ho!"

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,560
and was Laboon's pal!

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,010
He's coming aboard our ship,
even if I have to drag him.

62
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,840
He's joining our crew! Any objections, guys?

63
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,560
If there were, would you change your mind?

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,020
I wanna help him see Laboon again!

65
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,650
You've got my vote, dammit!

66
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,650
Same here, dummy!
I'm not afraid of that skeleton!

67
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,700
That's a given. I'm more concerned
about stopping Nami-san's marriage!

68
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,050
Hey, Zoro! Where are you going?

69
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to raid the place. Don't we
have one more shadow to recover now?

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,850
Sweet! Guys, get ready for our counterattack!

71
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,960
We're gonna knock
Thriller Bark outta the water!

72
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Yeah!

73
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,990
"Food, Nami, and Shadows!!
Luffy's Enraged Counterattack!"

74
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,490
What's this pole?

75
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,410
I might as well see what's at the top.

76
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,840
Here I go!

77
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,070
That's strange. I coulda sworn
my arms could stretch...

78
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,940
Weird! Did I dream that up?

79
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,020
I wonder if my legs can stretch.

80
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,150
Wh-What's that?!

81
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,030
Is that an earthquake?!

82
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,000
Sheesh! He's a stinking zombie,
so why does Oars have such a free spirit?!

83
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,710
What the heck is he doing up there?
He's making a ruckus.

84
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,040
Looks like they don't stretch.

85
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,340
Well, darn. I'll just have to climb.

86
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,640
Man! Hunting down the
zombies with our shadows

87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,850
sounds like it's gonna be a pain.

88
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,730
And Luffy's zombie is a real monster!

89
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,990
He's over twice the size of your average giant!

90
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,450
I'm not sure you guys can beat him!

91
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,910
Size isn't the only issue!
Luffy, he has your shadow!

92
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,710
Don't be such a baby!

93
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,540
Z-Zoro?

94
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,740
Size and strength mean nothing.

95
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,510
The only way to get Luffy's shadow
back is to take him down, right?

96
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,210
We don't need to search for the zombies.

97
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,470
Although I would like to see mine!

98
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,060
What's gotten into you?

99
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,940
If we stay like this, we'll never get to
walk under the light of the sun again!

100
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,650
But remember what that
grandpa zombie told us?

101
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,990
I saw what you just did!
You're terribly strong, aren't you?

102
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,870
So what did you wanna discuss?

103
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,000
There is a man I would like you to defeat.

104
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,690
I'm sure you could take him down!

105
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,590
He has created countless victims,

106
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,420
all of whom could be saved if you defeated him!

107
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,800
If we take out Gecko Moria,
everyone will get their shadow back!

108
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,110
Y-Yeah, that's what he said...

109
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,160
He's cutting to the heart
of the problem again...

110
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,760
And isn't Moria at the top of that staircase?

111
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,870
Whoa! He's dead on again!

112
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,080
So anyway, I'm gonna kick Moria's butt.

113
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,810
That way everyone will get their shadow back.

114
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,920
Sanji, you're in charge of rescuing Nami!

115
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,460
Yeah!

116
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,670
You'd better believe I am!

117
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,790
I don’t care if he’s an invisible
man or a dismissible sham!

118
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,680
I'll kick him to the ends of this fog!

119
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,390
I'll crash that wedding!

120
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,230
Oh, I forgot to mention this earlier,

121
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,770
but that invisible man
ogled at Nami in the bath.

122
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,070
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

123
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,030
What?!

124
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,860
Curse him!

125
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,060
Don't fire him up any more.

126
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,050
I'm afraid he might transform into something.

127
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,050
Damn you, invisible man! You're gonna pay!

128
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,680
Awesome! He exploded!

129
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,520
I feel bad about letting Nami get
whisked away right before my eyes.

130
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,990
I'm going with Sanji!

131
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,360
Besides, I don't wanna run
into that Warlord again!

132
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
That skeleton's duel has me concerned.

133
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,020
I'm going after him.

134
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,390
If Straw Hat throttles Moria
before he gets to fight,

135
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,790
that will be the end of it.

136
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,000
But we'll have a problem on our hands
if his shadow trashes him first.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,900
I'll join you, Franky.

138
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,220
What's the zombie of a legendary samurai
capable of? I'm dying to find out.

139
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,290
Nami-chan and the skeleton...

140
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,550
Simply put, they're the ones
who need immediate help.

141
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,730
Finally, subduing Moria
is key to claiming victory.

142
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,890
Guys, you're making this sound simple,

143
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,860
but he's one of the Seven Warlords!

144
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,820
Not a problem! So was Crocodile, remember?

145
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,240
And you don't see the problem?!
He nearly killed you!

146
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,470
I'm begging you! Please be careful!

147
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,210
I've already spelled this out loud
and clear, but your zombie is insane!

148
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,960
I get it, I get it!

149
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm on my way, Nami-san!

150
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,300
These are for you. Guys, you each get a bag.

151
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,910
They contain my special
Zombie Ascension Salt Balls.

152
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,980
Oh, is this what you were making
back there? I should have known.

153
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,440
You guys have no sense of danger,
so let me make this perfectly clear!

154
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,900
Just because these waters
are shrouded in thick fog

155
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,240
doesn't guarantee safety from the sunlight!

156
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,450
You're only safe because it's night!

157
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,500
In other words, consider your drop-dead
time limit to be dawn, when the sun rises!

158
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,000
No matter what, you can't
forget about this time limit!

159
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,590
You're absolutely right! It'd suck
if I couldn't eat before dawn.

160
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,550
We're gonna make you rue the
day you picked a fight with us!

161
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,200
Gecko Moria, we're taking back
twice the amount of food you stole!

162
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,620
And before dawn!

163
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,560
Yeah!

164
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,370
Uh, no. That's not what I meant.

165
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,900
You have to recover your shadows by--

166
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,100
--Let's go!
--Yeah!

167
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,040
--Uh, no. I meant--
--Nami-san! Take my hand, honey!

168
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,900
Fine, ignore me!

169
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,220
This spells trouble! I need to
hurry and inform the master.

170
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,090
Awesome! This is a ship?

171
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,930
Neat! Too cool!

172
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,990
I can't see squat on these waters,

173
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,890
but I see a great future ahead of me!

174
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,870
That was a close one.

175
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,370
All righty! With this ship,
I'm gonna become King of the Pirates!

176
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,670
Where is Oars right now?

177
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,470
He has climbed to the top of the mast, Master.

178
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,360
Is that right?

179
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,430
Hey! Really now, Master!

180
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,040
We can't enjoy our Laidback Fever

181
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,150
with that massive, dream-filled
zombie wandering around the island!

182
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,660
That bastard is rottin' bad news!

183
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,950
Leave him be! It's just a matter of time.

184
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,110
He'll calm down before long.

185
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,920
With Oars on our side,

186
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,540
we'll be able to steal shadows
from stronger pirates!

187
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,840
We'll start creating
Special Zombies left and right!

188
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,550
I'm going to need stronger mario, Hogback!

189
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,050
Just leave that to me.

190
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,410
H-Hogback-sama!

191
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,870
B-Big news! The pirates are...!

192
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,090
What is the matter, Hildon?

193
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,090
The three pirates we just stole
shadows from awoke on their ship.

194
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,340
They're coming back with their crewmates!

195
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,890
What?!

196
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,600
The people we stole shadows from
couldn't possibly be awake!

197
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,630
I-It looks like their friends
whacked them awake!

198
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,270
They seem to have ties with
the Humming Swordsman!

199
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,770
I believe he must have tipped them off.

200
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,450
As proof, all of the pirates
know how to purify the zombies!

201
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,160
Th-They what?!

202
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,000
The zombies are afraid of the pirates.

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,290
As such, they are currently
running for their lives!

204
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,000
This is rottin' bad!

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,090
Run for it!

206
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,760
The Wild Zombies, Surprise Zombies,
and Soldier Zombies

207
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,560
didn't stand a chance against them
before they knew about salt.

208
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,900
Send the General Zombies after them!

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,900
They can defeat the pirates
without getting fed salt!

210
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,880
Come to think of it,
where the heck is Absalom?!

211
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,070
Uh, about that...

212
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,470
His wedding ceremony is about to start...

213
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,540
The majority of the General Zombies
are attending his wedding.

214
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,880
What is wrong with those idiots?!

215
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,360
Oh, yes! Hogback-sama, he'd like
you to get everyone pumped up

216
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,140
at the reception in an hour
with your belly dance.

217
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,740
I suppose I could. Wedding ceremonies
are memories that last a lifetime.

218
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,830
I should make it fun and exciting--
This isn't the time for that!

219
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,090
Make him cancel the wedding right this instant!

220
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,200
I-I am merely a zombie, so I can't
tell Absalom-sama what to do...

221
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,660
This incident doesn't call for that beast.

222
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,000
What?

223
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,080
If we weaken them with my ghosts,

224
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,880
the Soldier Zombies should be
fully capable of capturing them.

225
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,340
Don't freak out just because they
learned the zombies' weakness!

226
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,220
I will bring all of them here bound up,

227
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,140
so go prepare mario for the rest of the crew.

228
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,690
I'm going back to my room.

229
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,310
Come on, Kumacy.

230
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,770
Okay! I'm coming.

231
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,080
She has a point. She certainly is reliable.

232
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,070
I should have expected as much
from the Ghost Princess!

233
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,320
Yes?

234
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,740
You could learn a thing or two...

235
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,890
...from Kumacy.

236
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,790
What?!

237
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,290
A-At any rate, it looks like everything
will be all right, Moria-sama.

238
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,100
Oh, really? That's no fun.

239
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Really, now! We all know
you weren't going to help...

240
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,060
I'm going to stay here for a while.

241
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,760
I want to play with Oars.

242
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,730
Then I have a favor to ask of you.

243
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,760
Since Absalom is currently preoccupied,

244
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,440
please give me command over two zombies.

245
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,990
Whatever. Pick out two
and take them with you.

246
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,250
Thank you very much!

247
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,450
In that case, I know just the two I want.

248
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,800
He's here!

249
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,590
--Where is Moria?!
--Stay away!

250
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,000
Get outta my way!

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,350
Give my food back!

252
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,200
Who's the bastard that peeped on
Nami-san when she was bathing?!

253
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,450
He's rottin' dangerous!

254
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,660
Show yourself!

255
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,960
They don't even need salt.
Their hearts are burning with anger.

256
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,920
Aren't they worried about their shadows?

257
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,340
"Moria's Dance Hall"

258
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,260
C-Captain! Five pirates are headed
straight for the dance hall!

259
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,390
"Gyaa!" "Waah!"

260
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,760
"Racing to the Dance Hall"

261
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,690
There are two on the lower bridge!

262
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,980
"Moria's Dance Hall"
"Perona's Room"
"Wonder Garden"

263
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,980
"Racing to the Dance Hall"
"Headed for Perona's Room"

264
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,550
All of them are too much for us!

265
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,980
Th-These guys are rottin' bad! Retreat for now!

266
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,990
--They're here!
--Run for it!

267
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,230
It ticks me off when I think about how
these weaklings managed to catch me!

268
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,350
If you're willing to adore me for setting ya free,

269
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,090
I'll let ya call me "Bro."

270
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,440
In your dreams!

271
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,170
Crap! I completely forgot!

272
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,270
What's wrong? What is it?

273
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,890
Ghosts!

274
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,500
I can't take it anymore! In my next life,
I hope I'm reborn as a mosquito larva.

275
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,830
I hope my eyebrows curl up
too much and I become an idiot.

276
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,460
Hey! Luffy! Sanji! What's gotten into you two?!

277
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,580
Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!

278
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,230
Robin, what just happened?

279
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,450
Those ghosts did it! They can
dishearten you with a touch.

280
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,870
As of right now, we don't
know how to counter them...

281
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,510
What?!

282
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,550
Sweet! I caught him!

283
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,250
We got this one!

284
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,440
--Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!
--Crap! They caught both of them!

285
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,150
Luffy! Sanji!

286
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,080
Shoot! Now that it's come to this--!

287
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
Lead Star!

288
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,450
Hurry!

289
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,540
If we lose heart like them, it's game over!

290
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,130
Our only hope is to carry them and run!

291
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,170
The ghosts are coming after us!

292
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,640
No! I don't want everyone to get caught!

293
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,990
This looks seriously bad!

294
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,980
S-Stay back!

295
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,390
Set sail! Set sail!

296
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,320
Huh?

297
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,210
We're falling!

298
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,920
Usopp! Sanji!

299
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,280
Wasn't that...? No, it couldn't be.

300
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,360
But I wasn't expecting that!
The stairs have completely vanished.

301
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,120
Wh-Wh-What was that? What happened?

302
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,980
A bunch of zombies, Usopp, and Sanji...

303
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,590
The whole lot of them fell
when the stairs gave out.

304
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,450
Forget about those two
who came hurtling down.

305
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,470
What the hell is that?

306
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,250
It came out of nowhere
and it's blocking our path!

307
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,490
What is this wall?!

308
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,190
Dammit! What just happened?

309
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,740
Ow, ow, ow... What was that...?

310
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,120
This isn't made out of stone...

311
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,250
Weapons Left!

312
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,580
What?! It wasn't effective?

313
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,300
No! What the heck are you two doing?!

314
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,370
See, this wall suddenly appeared in front of us.

315
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,010
Stupid! That's no wall!

316
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,370
That is Luffy's zombie!

317
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,890
What?!

318
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,940
This is...

319
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,110
Luffy's...

320
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,480
...z-zombie?!

321
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,800
"On the next episode, Oars' entry into
the fight suddenly changes everything!"

322
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,940
Now do you see just how
terrifying my ghosts are?

323
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm going to wipe out your entire crew!

324
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,850
Wait! I won't let you wipe us out!

325
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,170
Anyone can talk big!

326
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,970
Negative Hollow!

327
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,810
"Nami, who has gone missing..."

328
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,730
You've made one terrible mistake.

329
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,730
"...is getting married?!"

330
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

331
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,620
"Usopp's the Strongest?
Leave Anything Negative to Him!"

332
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
