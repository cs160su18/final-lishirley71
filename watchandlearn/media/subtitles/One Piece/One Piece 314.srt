00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,860
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,710
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,390
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,270
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,940
A long time ago, I made the decision
that I'd never again build a ship.

35
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,880
But I wanted to catch up to the
person who was my goal after all.

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,530
The next thing I knew, I was
drawing blueprints for a ship.

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,950
My dream is... to use that treasure tree...

38
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,500
...to build one last ship...
A dream ship that crosses any sea!

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,300
I've already obtained this treasure tree.

40
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,510
I've already got blueprints, too.

41
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,850
I'm going to build this ship now.

42
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,270
So... when it's completed...

43
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,070
...will you set sail on the ship I've built?!

44
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,030
What?

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,890
What?!

46
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,080
Dammit!

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,620
Wake up!

48
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,170
Luffy!

49
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,920
O-Ouch! That hurt!

50
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
That hurt?! What're you saying?!

51
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,790
That was a punch! There's no
way that'd work on rubber!

52
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,050
There's no means to ward off a fist of love!

53
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,560
Looks like you've gone on
quite the rampage, huh, Luffy?

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,150
Ack! G-G-G...

55
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,810
Grandpa!

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,850
What?

57
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,450
What?!

58
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,660
A-A Navy Vice Admiral is...

59
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,440
"The Strongest Family?
Luffy's Father Revealed!"

60
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,550
Luffy!

61
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,310
Isn't there something you

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,600
"Monkey D. Garp
'Garp the Fist'
Vice Admiral, Navy Headquarters"

63
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,600
need to apologize to me for?!

64
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,890
Vice Admiral Garp's got a grandson?!

65
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,770
This is the first I've heard of it!

66
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,230
Garp?!

67
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,700
"Garp" is the name of a Navy hero!

68
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,910
What?!

69
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,340
Luffy! Is he really your grandpa?!

70
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,580
That's right! Don't you dare mess with him!

71
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,970
When I was small, he almost
killed me a bunch of times!

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,730
Now, don't go around giving me a bad name.

73
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,110
I shoved you into a bottomless pit...

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,200
I threw you into a jungle at night...

75
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,500
I attached you to balloons and let them fly...

76
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,630
I did all those things in order
to make you a strong man!

77
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,020
I think I've just discovered where
Luffy's endless vitality comes from...

78
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,480
I eventually entrusted you with my
friend and had you train with Ace...

79
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,240
...but I take my eyes off you,
and look what happens...

80
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,620
I trained you to become a strong marine!

81
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,330
I told you over and over that
I wanted to become a pirate!

82
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,670
You got corrupted by "Red Hair"! How foolish!

83
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,100
Sh-Shanks saved my life! Don't badmouth him!

84
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,990
How dare you talk like that to your grandpa?!

85
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,890
Ahhh! I'm sorry!

86
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,150
This is terrible! Luffy got captured by the Navy!

87
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,980
Luffy!

88
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,630
Let go of me! Ow, ow, ow...

89
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,900
Oh, no! Luffy's combative spirit against
that old man has already been broken!

90
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,820
What?! They fell asleep?!

91
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,270
W-Well, what the heck should we do?

92
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,830
I've never been in this kind of situation!

93
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,470
Oh, no. I fell asleep.

94
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,790
Hm?!

95
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,840
Wake up, Luffy!

96
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,270
Is that how you behave
when you're being scolded?!

97
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,760
And that's not how you should speak
to your grandpa in the first place!

98
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,940
I don't care anymore. Do as you please.

99
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,620
Ribbit?

100
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,780
Seriously?!

101
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,520
So Luffy's grandpa is a marine
at Navy Headquarters?

102
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,480
This is getting crazy...

103
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,500
Ribbit...

104
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,960
Th-Th-That hurt!

105
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:10,660
Do you even know what kind of pirate
"Red Hair" is to start with?!

106
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,280
Shanks?! Are they... Are Shanks
and the others doing okay?!

107
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,530
Where are they?!

108
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,220
Doing okay?!

109
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,400
Well, there are countless pirates
nowadays, but out of all of them,

110
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,890
he's ranked in the top four pirates,
in the same league as Whitebeard.

111
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,840
These four reign over the second half
of the Grand Line like emperors.

112
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,220
So people call them the Four Emperors.

113
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,370
Navy Headquarters and the
Seven Warlords of the Sea

114
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,110
have joined together to
fight against these four!

115
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,080
If the balance among these
three great powers is lost,

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,250
it is said that world peace will fall apart.
That's how large their power is.

117
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,150
Huh? Err...

118
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,050
I didn't really get all that,
but it's good to hear he's doing okay.

119
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,970
It really brings back memories.

120
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,630
I'll leave this hat with you.

121
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,440
It's dear to me.

122
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,540
Take good care of it!

123
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,490
Come bring it back to me someday!

124
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,410
Once you've become a great pirate!
That's our promise, Luffy!

125
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,750
Luffy and "Red Hair" know each other?

126
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,610
Luffy told me that this guy
entrusted the straw hat with him.

127
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,850
But I didn't realize this guy
was such a famous person.

128
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,970
Th-This way, Zoro-san!

129
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,290
Dammit! The Navy is already here!

130
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,900
Please go on ahead!

131
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,660
Well, really...

132
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,880
We're sorry that we tried to extort you!

133
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,160
Well, don't worry about it!
Thanks for showing me the way! Later!

134
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,130
Hm? What's going on?!

135
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,670
That's Pirate Hunter Zoro,
a criminal with a bounty on his head.

136
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,810
Oh...? That's Luffy's friend.

137
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,090
He's quite energetic, huh?

138
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,180
Well, you guys, try stopping him.

139
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,550
Yes, sir!

140
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,940
Kukris, huh? It's not often that you see those.

141
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,360
Hiya!

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,690
Hiya! Hiya!

143
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,030
Hey, Zoro, wait! You don't have to fight!

144
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,490
What the...? You bastard!

145
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,240
Shave!

146
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,410
This technique...

147
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,090
--Sergeant Major!
--Sergeant!

148
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,890
You guys are no match for them at all!

149
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,590
You really are strong.

150
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,860
I'd expect no less from you!

151
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,060
I concede!

152
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,110
Luffy-san! Zoro-san!

153
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,070
It's been a while. Do you recognize me?

154
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,570
Who are you?

155
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,040
It's me! Coby!

156
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,500
Don't you remember me?

157
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,030
Coby?

158
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,850
Do you think... even I could join the Navy?

159
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,430
--Navy?
--Yes! Catching bad guys is my dream!

160
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,850
It's been my dream ever since I was little!
Do you think I can do it?!

161
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,440
Luffy-san and I haven't known
each other long, but we are friends!

162
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,480
Right?

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,480
Yeah! We're gonna part ways,
but we'll always be friends!

164
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,320
Thank you! I'll never forget
all you've done for me!

165
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Let's meet again sometime, Coby!

166
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
--Luffy-san...
--Bye!

167
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,740
All hands, salute!

168
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,370
See ya!

169
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,330
Coby?!

170
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,920
I do have a friend Coby...
but the Coby I know was short.

171
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,390
That's me! The Coby who
was a hopeless crybaby!

172
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,850
What?! Is that true?!

173
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,710
That Coby?

174
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,480
Why are you in the Grand Line?

175
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,000
I've still got a ways to go
to become a Navy Officer,

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,360
but when I heard that you were nearby,
I just wanted to see you guys so badly.

177
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,610
What?!

178
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,160
We owe you two for helping us

179
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,830
"Coby
Sergeant Major, Navy Headquarters"

180
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,830
become who we are now!

181
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,870
"Helmeppo
Sergeant, Navy Headquarters"

182
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,870
Well, I wouldn't go that far, but...

183
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,700
For various reasons, Vice Admiral Garp
is currently training us at Headquarters.

184
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,340
Oh, yeah?

185
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,250
At any rate, usually people can
only grow so much, you know!

186
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm so surprised!

187
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,730
Your body was flabby!

188
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,580
Sorry for visiting now, when you're
tired after all you went through.

189
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,510
Don't worry about it. It's been
a while. Let's have a party!

190
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,700
Hold on a sec, you guys!

191
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,250
You haven't noticed me, have you?!

192
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,210
Who are you?

193
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,410
It's me! It's me!

194
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,840
I don't know you. Who are you?

195
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,230
The answer is...

196
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,260
...Helmeppo. The son of Captain Morgan...

197
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,100
Helmeppo!

198
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,540
I'm the man who crucified you and
nearly executed you, Roronoa Zoro!

199
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,030
Huh?!

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,360
Now you remember me, right?

201
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,320
Huh?

202
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,250
Hey, hey, that's enough.

203
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,960
It's not nice to be a bully!

204
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,300
You seem surprisingly well, Roronoa Zoro...

205
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,220
--Take this! And this!
--Stop! Stop!

206
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,400
That specially treated stupid son!

207
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,950
Oh...

208
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,790
It's you...

209
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,990
Hey!

210
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,360
Oh, yeah... There was a
guy like that. So it's you!

211
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,320
I still can't stand these guys, Coby!

212
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,320
It can't be helped, Helmeppo-san.
You should accept the past.

213
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,040
Oh, that?

214
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,280
Yeah, that.

215
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,370
Luffy-san, you and I are now enemies, but...

216
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,830
Hm?

217
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,420
...are we still... um...

218
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,800
Yeah. We're friends.

219
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,940
Well then, you guys...!

220
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,060
Yes, sir!

221
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,510
Repair this wall.

222
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,620
What?!

223
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,610
That's so selfish!

224
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,460
If you were going to have it fixed,
why did you break it in the first place?!

225
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,120
It's cooler to go in that way, isn't it?!

226
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,780
Don't break things for reasons like that!

227
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,830
Well then, we'll repair it,
so please help us, okay?!

228
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,560
What?!

229
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,550
Okay.

230
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,830
I thought your grandpa was a big shot.

231
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,720
Well... I don't know much about his job.

232
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,400
Come to think of it, Luffy...

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,940
I heard that you saw your old man.

234
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,540
What?! My dad?

235
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,700
What do you mean by my dad? I have a dad?

236
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh... Then he didn't tell you who he was?

237
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,830
I heard that he saw you off at Loguetown.

238
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,260
Loguetown...

239
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,060
Err...

240
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,800
Huh?

241
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,760
So that's the island where Loguetown is!

242
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,760
That island is where Gold Roger
was born and then executed, right?

243
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,100
Wow, you actually remember!

244
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,870
The town where the King of the Pirates died...

245
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,070
Also known as the city
of the beginning and end...

246
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,960
Wh-What's going on?

247
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,970
To my several hundred billion
servants around the world! Look!

248
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,230
We'll now super flashily
start the open execution!

249
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,260
Monkey D. Luffy! You can
no longer move even an inch.

250
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,610
You feel honored, Straw Hat?!

251
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,470
You can die in the same place
the King of the Pirates died.

252
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,950
Since you have a big audience, do you
wanna say something before you die?

253
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,290
Well, that's okay.

254
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,670
Whether you wanna say something or not
doesn't matter, since you're gonna die.

255
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm the man who'll be King of the Pirates!!

256
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,640
Out of our way!

257
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,820
Not even Zoro can stop me now!

258
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
This is the end of your captain!!

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,280
Damn bastard!

260
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,870
If I cut down the execution platform...

261
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,880
Zoro! Sanji!

262
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,330
--Hurry up!
--Usopp!

263
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,300
--This is heavy!
--Nami!

264
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,260
Sorry.

265
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,970
I'm... dead.

266
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,930
I'm still alive after all.

267
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,750
I got lucky.

268
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,680
The Straw Hat gang is running away!

269
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,710
Capture them!

270
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,680
Go after them!

271
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,400
Luffy's old man was in that town?!

272
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,690
Wh-What's my dad like?

273
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,650
I'm curious... about Luffy's father!

274
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,550
Your father's name is...

275
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,110
...Monkey D. Dragon. He's a revolutionary!

276
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,120
You're running out of your devil's luck.

277
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,930
Don't be so sure.

278
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,300
You're...

279
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,180
Dragon?

280
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,890
What?!

281
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,820
Whaaat?!

282
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,380
T-T-The revolutionary Dragon has a son?!

283
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,060
Luffy-san is the son of that Dragon?!

284
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,090
Then... Dragon is Vice Admiral Garp's son?!

285
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,630
What the hell is with his family?!

286
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,790
I've never heard Dragon's full name before!

287
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,810
Hey, guys... What are you so surprised about?

288
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,780
Idiot! You don't know the name "Dragon"?!

289
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,350
Your father is a dangerous man!

290
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,610
Huh?

291
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,730
Ribbit...

292
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,360
Hey, Robin...

293
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,110
How can I explain it...?

294
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,880
Pirates wouldn't start a fight
with the Government or Navy,

295
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,910
but there's a power trying to bring down
the World Government directly now.

296
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,790
That's the revolutionary army.

297
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,590
And Dragon is the man who leads it.

298
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,050
Their ideology has now spread in
many countries around the world,

299
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,930
which caused rebellions and
led several kingdoms to fall.

300
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,160
The government naturally became angry

301
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,890
and has been searching everywhere for
their mastermind, Dragon, all this time

302
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,010
as the world's most heinous criminal...

303
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,740
...but he's been considered a mysterious man
whose background was completely unknown.

304
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,700
And yet...

305
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,410
And yet?

306
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,800
Ah! I guess...

307
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,500
...I shouldn't have said anything about it, huh?

308
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,900
What?!

309
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,810
Well, then...

310
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,100
...forget what I just said!

311
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,310
Whaaat?!

312
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,630
Are you really going back already?

313
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,610
Why don't you have dinner with us? Dinner!

314
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,350
We're enemies. We can't become close, so...

315
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,180
I'm so glad that I was able
to see you two again today!

316
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,350
Let's meet again for sure in the New World!

317
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,320
On the next episode of One Piece!

318
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,570
"Its Name Is the New World!
The Fate of the Grand Line!"

319
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
