00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,970
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,730
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,240
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,320
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,420
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,010
--Sogeking!
--There's no time to lose!

35
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,520
Jump down from there!

36
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,270
Hm?

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,730
Usopp!

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,110
Hey... He couldn't have... right?

39
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,790
Hey! Usopp!

40
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,320
Ahhh!!

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,880
You called?!

42
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,190
Hey, you're alive!

43
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,940
Hey! Don't you guys have
the kindness to catch a hero

44
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,570
making a desperate jump
off of the rooftop?! Morons!

45
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,070
There's an escort ship on the
other side of the bridge, huh?

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,980
Don't you think that is the key to our escape?

47
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,280
Looks like stealing that ship
is our only chance of surviving.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,430
Franky...

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,660
...Convert!

50
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,750
Franky Centaur!

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,670
Hold it, you bastards!

52
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,240
Although your physical ability
indeed spikes, exceeding its limits,

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,880
your physical strength itself just can't
keep up with that intensification.

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,900
That's not really smart.
You're shortening your life, you know that?

55
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,770
It's better than losing all sorts
of things right before my eyes!

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,990
I'll do whatever I can do!

57
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,190
You're too ambitious!

58
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,360
Tempest Kick!

59
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,700
That naive idea of yours that you
can save everyone and escape...

60
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,300
Let's see how far it gets you.

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,760
What're you doing, you jerk?!

62
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,250
Ahh!

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,950
Behind the fog...

64
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,530
...we can see the outline of the ships!

65
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,140
H-Hey, don't run away! Wait!

66
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,010
Oh, no...

67
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,530
This serves you right!

68
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,450
They're here! They're finally here!

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,530
A fleet of battleships!

70
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,810
The Buster Call has begun!

71
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,910
"I Can't Protect Anyone Unless I Win!
Third Gear Activated!"

72
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,100
I repeat. Our targets are Straw Hat Luffy
and his gang of about sixty pirates!

73
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,160
Completely destroy Enies Lobby!

74
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,670
Ah... H-Hey!

75
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,830
Hey, look at that, you guys! Don't run!

76
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,260
See? The battleships are ignoring
the bridge--they aren't attacking us!

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,400
That's because I'm here!

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,990
That's right. My old man said it, too.

79
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,230
Even the indiscriminate cannon fire avoided him!

80
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,950
However, the bridge the criminal
Nico Robin is on is an exception for now.

81
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,950
Hey! Look at this! This bridge is safe!

82
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,120
That's because I'm the Chief of CP9!

83
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,690
What a crazy sight...

84
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,340
Hm? Hey, are you...

85
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,650
I can't stop trembling.

86
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,450
I'm exercising a Buster Call.

87
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,580
Commence concerted fire!

88
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,380
We're targeting everything on Ohara,
the island of archaeology.

89
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,430
Annihilate the devils living in Ohara!
In the name of justice!

90
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,410
Buster Call...

91
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,460
Merciless, indiscriminate cannon fire...

92
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,420
It destroys anything and everything.

93
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,610
It's hellfire.

94
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,290
That tragedy is... That grisly event is...

95
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,680
...happening again...

96
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,010
Let's hurry, you guys! Be quick!

97
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,370
Stop bossing us around, you jerk!

98
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,370
If I may say one more thing,
this is affecting my wounds.

99
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,730
Could you carry me a little more softly?

100
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,340
Don't ask too much! Besides,
you're contradicting yourself.

101
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,060
As the price I paid for my great work,

102
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,360
it's no exaggeration to say that
I have wounds all over my body!

103
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,290
Ahh! All my ribs got broken! All six of them!

104
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,330
There are more than that, so don't worry.

105
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,160
Seriously, you're such a pain!

106
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,290
By the way, would you like to know
the secret of my new weapon, Kabuto?

107
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,650
I shall explain it for you. Kabuto,
the weapon that belongs to Sogeking, is...

108
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,180
--Sparkle!
--Shut up, you jerk! Or we'll make you run!

109
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,140
Please! Spare me! My ribs
got broken! A-All ten of them...

110
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,950
--There are more than that.
--What?

111
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,010
Then 20... 30?

112
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,450
How about 100?!

113
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,610
There are more than that!

114
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,110
No way that's true!

115
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,660
Is that cannon fire?

116
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,500
The Navy sure does put on a big show.

117
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,840
Amazing! Amazing! Cannon fire! Cannon fire!

118
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,030
Hey, they aren't festival fireworks, you know.

119
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,670
Anyway, where's Luffy right now?

120
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,160
You know, pirate lady, that iron
door we came through...

121
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,430
The pirate guy broke it.

122
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,680
Luffy did?

123
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,960
It was amazing... though he became small.

124
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,810
S-Small? Luffy did?!

125
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,930
Yep!

126
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,440
So these are the ones, huh?

127
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,350
Third Gear!

128
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,120
They opened...

129
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,800
All right! I'm heading there now!

130
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,640
What?! How come you're small now?!

131
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,560
Third Gear?

132
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,130
He opened the iron doors and
became small? What the heck?

133
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,810
That must've been fun!

134
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,560
Yep, Grandma! That pirate guy is fun!

135
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
She's not making any sense!

136
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,240
Anyway, let's hurry and...

137
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,020
Oh? Grandma, I can hear something down there.

138
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,730
Now that you mention it, yeah.

139
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,970
We don't have time to stop here right now.

140
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,520
No matter what it is,
we just have to keep on going!

141
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,840
Now, let's go resolutely!

142
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,760
Grandma! You're cool!

143
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,680
Th-That's...

144
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,650
Water!

145
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,790
What the heck is going on?!

146
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,700
Why is there water?! What?!
Why?! We have no way out!

147
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,090
Help!

148
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,230
Whether there's someone in the passage or not,

149
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,020
no one can now reach this place.

150
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,560
You bastard!

151
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,650
Soon this room will be submerged in the sea.

152
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,950
Coo coo!

153
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,620
You son of a bitch!

154
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,750
This place is located above the sea.
The seawater won't reach here.

155
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,850
Coo coo!

156
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,350
You can hear the sounds of the
battleships' cannon fire, right?

157
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,410
What happened to your pirate crew...
What happened to Nico Robin...

158
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,170
You must be worried.

159
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,390
If you wanna go rescue them, go right ahead.

160
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,270
I won't take my focus off of you.

161
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,160
No matter what they're going through
right now, they'll survive for sure!

162
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,740
But if I let you get away now,
you'll go kill my friends!

163
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,240
I won't take my focus off of you!

164
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,770
The cannon attack has begun.

165
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,530
By the way, I can hear a
strange sound ahead of here.

166
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,700
Shut your mouth!

167
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,410
Hurry!

168
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,990
Ah... Ow, ow, ow...

169
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,870
Hm?

170
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,560
As I thought, I sense something odd...

171
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,380
I hate to say this, but unlike you two,
I'm delicate and cautious.

172
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,770
And my sense is telling me...

173
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,730
...this sound is probably...

174
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,590
Ah...

175
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,890
Hey!

176
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,380
Wait up!

177
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,130
Whoa!

178
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,470
My ribs got broken again! Wait up, you guys!

179
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,540
I'm severely injured with
broken bones all over my body!

180
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,550
Nooo!

181
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,800
Grandma! What's going on?!

182
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,090
Who cares?! Hurry up and run!

183
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,880
You have a high caliber, befitting a boss.

184
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,110
I'd like for a certain idiot to hear that.

185
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,870
But I wonder... if your abilities are
good enough to back up that decision!

186
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,830
The result will be the same if you die!

187
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,400
Hey! Capture Nico Robin already!

188
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,880
Once this is all over, I'll be able
to become the world's hero!

189
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,870
The Buster Call sounds like a gun salute for me!

190
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,640
Razor!

191
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,360
Finger Pistol!

192
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,440
Tempest Kick! Leopard Tail!

193
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,540
Can you really defeat me?!

194
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,290
I can't protect anyone unless I win!

195
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,560
Gum-Gum...

196
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,260
...Rifle!

197
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,720
Iron Body. Empty Tree.

198
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,740
Razor!

199
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,170
I'll give you credit for having the guts to
pick a fight with the World Government.

200
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,780
But in the end, you're just like any other pirate.

201
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,010
It seems your level is nowhere
near enough to put up a good fight.

202
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,290
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

203
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,510
Flying Finger Pistol...

204
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,790
Pick!

205
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,680
Three Picks!

206
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,460
Flying Finger Pistol...

207
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,340
Fire Pick!

208
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,240
I thought I was able to meet a man
with some backbone. How disappointing.

209
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,650
Did you run out of strength from
your doping earlier after all?

210
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,130
If it's backbone you want, I'll show you...

211
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,590
...another tactic!

212
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,360
Third... Gear!

213
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,610
Bone Balloon!

214
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,070
Bone?

215
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,700
The power that moves
from one bone to another...

216
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,280
Take a look! My left arm is...

217
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,870
...the arm of a giant!

218
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,920
If it's all show, don't even bother!

219
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,380
Gum-Gum...

220
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,880
Iron Body!

221
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,380
...Giant Pistol!

222
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,420
Wh-What the hell is that?!

223
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,880
Justice would never surrender to evil.

224
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,080
For example, if there's a soldier
who can't protect what he should,

225
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,470
that alone is a crime.

226
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,520
Everything I do is in the name of justice!

227
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,810
In the past... and in the future, too!

228
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

229
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,190
"Shivering Past! Dark Justice and Rob Lucci"

230
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,760
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
