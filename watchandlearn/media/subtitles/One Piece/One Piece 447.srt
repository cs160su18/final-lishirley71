2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,260
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,000
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,330
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,370
But Ace has already been taken
away to the Navy Headquarters!

53
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,330
--I'm going!
--Huh?!

54
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,750
I'm gonna go to Navy Headquarters!

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,300
Now Luffy and others are trying to
break out and have gotten to level 4

56
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,430
but at the staircase to level 3, they
face the furious Vice Warden Hannyabal!

57
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,850
This is the great fort of hell!

58
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,350
If we let prisoners out of here, the
world will be filled with terror!

59
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,820
So as I said, I won't let you take...

60
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,400
...even a single step!

61
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,240
The only thing I care about
is saving Ace! So just move!

62
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,830
Cut it out!

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
All this arguing about right and wrong!

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,040
Search the ends of the earth,

65
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,200
and you'd find no answer!

66
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,710
So, cut the crap!

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,060
Looks like you were in middle of something!

68
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,150
Teech! Why the hell are you here?!

69
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,900
Or should I call you Blackbeard now?

70
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,440
Blackbeard!

71
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,870
So you're... Blackbeard?!

72
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,200
Pay your respects at Ace's grave!

73
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,500
If it weren't for him,
you'd be the one who...

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,630
...would've been killed, Straw Hat!

75
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,590
Then why don't you try to kill me now?!

76
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,600
Gum-Gum...

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,760
...Jet...

78
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,640
...Pistol!

79
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,410
"Jet Pistol of Anger! Luffy vs. Blackbeard!"

80
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,240
Captain!

81
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,590
I won't let Ace die!

82
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,930
Gum-Gum...

83
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,720
...Jet...

84
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,550
Vortex!

85
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,690
Straw-chan!

86
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,080
Blood? I thought his body was rubber!

87
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,010
Blood?

88
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,720
Seems like you don't have
any idea of what happened!

89
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,510
You brother Ace looked like that!

90
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,160
I think that you got it when I grabbed you!

91
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,750
Another thing that my darkness drags in is...

92
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,870
...Devil Fruit powers!

93
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,980
That means as long as I touch them,

94
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,430
Devil Fruit eaters can't
use all of their powers!

95
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,760
And that's how I beat Ace! Don't you get it?

96
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,390
Devil Fruit powers are ineffective before me!

97
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,900
So what?!

98
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,910
Wait, Luffy-kun! Enough already!

99
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,960
Let me go!

100
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,710
Not now! Hold your anger!

101
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,330
Let me go!

102
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,020
No, Luffy-kun! What is your priority?!

103
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,670
Think about it! Luffy-kun!

104
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,060
Ever since he was on good old
Whitebeard's ship, he was so strange!

105
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,480
I don't know how he got it

106
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,960
but he has this power that enabled him
to defeat even the unbeatable Ace-san!

107
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,660
You can't waste your time and energy here!

108
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,700
Fighting with him out of anger now
doesn't help you to save Ace-san!

109
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,800
You're stronger than I thought!

110
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
You got more Haki than you did before!

111
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,630
Your name is Blackbeard?

112
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,760
I heard that a nameless pirate...

113
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,230
...who was on Whitebeard's ship
had taken my place as a Warlord.

114
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,730
But it's odd.

115
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,070
You should've been summoned
by Navy Headquarters already.

116
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,150
Why are you here?

117
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,080
You're risking your title of Warlord
that you really wanted by being here.

118
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,290
It's all part of my plan!

119
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,960
Do I have to tell you everything about it?

120
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,710
Mr. Crocodile!

121
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,840
No, you don't. Actually
I'm not interested at all.

122
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,760
Oh, how cold of you!

123
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,930
H-Hey! What's going on?!

124
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,600
Magellan's here!

125
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,730
It's not good.

126
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,770
Straw boy, you better go now!

127
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,110
If you get poisoned by Magellan again,
there's no way for you to survive this time!

128
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,410
It's Warden Magellan!

129
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,660
Dammit! Everyone, run!

130
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,080
Warden Magellan...

131
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,420
Thank god! Warden's here!

132
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,250
Magellan... I get to meet him finally!

133
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,670
Climb up the stairs!

134
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,090
The bazooka troops are gone!
Nothing's in our way now!

135
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,020
Ivankov! Mmm... I won't let you go!

136
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,730
Let me hear the scream of a queer!

137
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,650
P-P-Princess! P-P-Please don't!

138
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,440
S-S-Striking me with your
whip? It's gonna hurt!

139
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,530
What happened to you?

140
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,700
But I like how you're freaking out!

141
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Now stop fighting me!

142
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,330
I-I-I got it! I'm coming to you now!

143
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,670
Catch me if you can!

144
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,510
Mmm... My whip!

145
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,110
Give it back to me, Ivankov!

146
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,810
If you're so into screaming,

147
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,980
why don't you scream yourself?!

148
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,770
I'm the queen of queers--Ivankov!

149
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,030
Why don't you call me Mistress?!

150
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,280
Heehaw!

151
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,810
Ivankov!

152
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,500
Straw Hat! You better hurry and
climb up the stairs to level 3!

153
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,640
It's fortunate for us that you broke
their defense on the staircase!

154
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,520
You helped us, too.

155
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,350
We took advantage of the
panic that you caused!

156
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,400
Yes! We can get to level 3!

157
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,820
Let's go at once!

158
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,680
It's a demon guard again!

159
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,640
This time, it's Minotaurus!

160
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,150
What?! Minotaurus?!

161
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,610
"Oh Come My Way" Kenpo:

162
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,080
Memoirs of a Winter's Sky!

163
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,660
Ready, Straw Hat?!

164
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,830
--Candle Lock!
--Alright!

165
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,120
Gum-Gum...

166
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,540
...Mallet Rifle!

167
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,960
I thought that we already
beat him on level 3!

168
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,880
It's inevitable.

169
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,810
They're all awakened Zoan
type Devil Fruit eaters!

170
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,350
That's why they're extremely
tough and resilient!

171
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,270
So you're saying that he
ate the Devil Fruit, too?!

172
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,940
If we don't hurry up, the
other three will recover soon.

173
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,010
But we shouldn't be afraid of them now.

174
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,660
Because the boss of hell
will be here any minute!

175
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,310
Warden Magellan!

176
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:44,260
I got a report that Blackbeard is already
on this floor at the staircase to level 3!

177
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,590
I ordered Shiryu to handle
them! Was he defeated?!

178
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,640
--This is the monitoring room!
--What now?!

179
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,350
We've got a problem!

180
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,520
Somebody broke the Vision
Receiver Transponder Snail...

181
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,480
...and none of monitors are working now!

182
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,190
Plus, all communication channels to the Navy
HQ and government agencies are cut off!

183
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,950
So we can't contact...

184
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,290
W-What's going on here?

185
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,500
What's the matter?! What happened?!

186
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,170
--Who did all that?!
--Clank!

187
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,510
Don't blow my cover!

188
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,090
I don't want Magellan clued in!

189
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,160
The communication has been cut!

190
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,490
--Send someone to check!
--Yes, sir!

191
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,710
This is bad.

192
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,120
If Blackbeard got
to this floor, it means that...

193
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,960
...he has broken the block that I set
on level 2 and made his way there!

194
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,300
Nothing is going as planned!

195
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,340
We allowed just this one rat to
sneak in and now look at this mess!

196
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,680
--Buggy!
--Mr. 3!

197
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,350
--Buggy!
--Mr. 3!

198
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,890
We are flashy lucky men!

199
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,230
Guys! We're finally here! It's level 1!

200
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,740
Everyone! We're gonna go
out on the sunny street!

201
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,500
Our very lucky savior!
Captain Buggy!

202
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,080
I can't believe that the poison
block had gone on its own!

203
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,130
Yeah, me too!

204
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,380
We're so lucky!

205
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm gonna save Ace at any cost!

206
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,480
Yeah, I'm not gonna say that it's a waste!

207
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,190
Anything is possible in this world!

208
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,310
I told you that the Sky Island exists!

209
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,840
She said "Sky Island!"

210
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,670
Give me a break!

211
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,390
Hey, you got me there.

212
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,670
You guys believe in such an ancient legend...

213
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,680
that there's an island in the sky?

214
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,110
Listen. The era where pirates
dream about things is over!

215
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,360
When I see idiots chasing after
dreams like that, I get disgusted!

216
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,910
Luffy!

217
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,480
The Sky Island exists.

218
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,620
You're that guy...

219
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,920
The new era they're talking about is crap!

220
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,130
The era where pirates have dreams
will be over, they say?! Huh?!

221
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,520
People's dreams... have no end!!

222
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,810
Isn't that right?!

223
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,820
And so does the One Piece!
It certainly exists!

224
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,990
You all should look forward to this!

225
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,710
In a few hours, we're going to...

226
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,880
...put on a show that's
gonna shake the whole world!

227
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,510
Don't stop, Luffy-kun!

228
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,480
Heehaw!

229
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,360
Keep going!

230
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,900
To level 3!

231
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,990
There's no way that we can beat
him! We can't get through!

232
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,790
He's pushing us backward on
his way down the staircase!

233
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,760
Damn! We're helpless! What should we do?!

234
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,720
Hey, Straw Hat! Be careful!

235
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,230
--Straw-chan! Let me help...
--Wait!

236
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,500
Why?

237
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,480
We better not bother him now!

238
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,490
Hey! What do you mean
"bother?!" I just wanna...

239
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,240
Outta my way!

240
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,800
Straw-chan!

241
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,930
Second Gear!

242
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,020
Gum-Gum...

243
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,600
...Jet...

244
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,690
...Pistol!

245
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,700
Ace!

246
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,250
A-Amazing!

247
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,120
He finished the demon
guard with a single blow!

248
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,670
He's quite a guy as I thought!

249
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,530
Straw-chan!

250
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,130
Okay, guys! The lid of the
pot of hell is off now!

251
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,710
Let's go!

252
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,090
Warden!

253
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,440
Can you just help me, Warden?!

254
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,400
Sadie-chan! What happened to you?!

255
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,750
Okama-kov... has beaten me!

256
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,540
It's humiliating! My life
is about dominating others!

257
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,620
Help her get down! I gotta run!

258
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,320
Oh, yes! Right away!

259
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,520
Are you Magellan?!

260
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,190
So you're Blackbeard?!

261
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,860
Yes, indeed!

262
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,150
Hydra!

263
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,420
I don't have time to ask
what brought you guys here!

264
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,510
Ouch! What is this?!

265
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,220
It should be poison! Dammit! That bastard!

266
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,650
Hannyabal!

267
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm surprised that you held out this long!

268
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,340
Let me handle the rest!

269
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,250
Vice Warden!

270
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,650
You look horrible!

271
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,440
--Give him the treatment now!
--Yes, sir!

272
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,260
Vice Warden! Stay with me! Vice Warden!

273
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,060
You can't die! Because you're the only one...

274
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,310
...who can take my place!

275
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,160
Straw Hat! How did you survive
after I poisoned you?!

276
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,790
He's probably the one who
caused this situation!

277
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,040
I must take his life for sure this time!

278
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:51,180
Straw Hat!

279
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,520
Is that Magellan?!

280
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,480
That was from the bottom of the stairs!
Once he catches us, we're dead!

281
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,700
That poison bastard!

282
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,430
I will never let you get out of this prison!

283
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,890
Luffy and the others have finally reached level 3.

284
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,680
In order to hold off Magellan,
who continues to gain on them,

285
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,930
Ivan-san orders Inazuma to seal off
the stairway leading to level 2

286
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,680
and remains behind on level 3 alone

287
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,560
where he unleashes his secret technique,
New Kama Kempo, on Magellan!

288
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,040
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,980
"Stop Magellan! Ivan-san's
Esoteric Technique Explodes!"

290
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
