2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,890
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,320
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,650
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,420
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,860
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,900
After hearing that his brother Ace was
captured by the navy and is waiting to be executed,

50
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,780
Luffy stowed away on a navy ship
with the Snake Princess's help

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,370
and headed to the Great Prison - Impel Down!

52
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,720
"The Friends' Whereabouts! The Science
of Weather and the Mechanical Island!"

53
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,090
If you were to take a trip,
where would you want to go?

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,410
Zoro!

55
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,970
Brook!

56
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,640
Usopp!

57
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,560
Sanji!

58
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,690
Franky!

59
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,240
Nami!

60
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,440
Chopper!

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,490
Robin!

62
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,060
Luffy?

63
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,710
It was just a dream.

64
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,340
You were screaming.

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,930
I saw my friends.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,990
I see.

67
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,010
What can I say to cheer him up?

68
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
Luffy.

69
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,020
Don't worry.

70
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,630
You have to think first
about saving your brother.

71
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,640
You have faith in your friends.

72
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,080
Don't you?

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
You...

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,120
Plus,

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,710
you are not alone now.

76
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,760
I am here for you.

77
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,640
Hancock!

78
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,430
How foolish I've been!

79
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,270
I didn't notice there's
been a goddess on my side!

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,920
Luffy!

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Hancock!

82
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,400
...And that's how it'd all play out!

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,620
--No, I can't do it! Yes, I want to! No, I can't!
--What're you doing, Hammock?

84
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,040
Meanwhile, a few days ago...

85
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,470
W-What happened?

86
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,940
Silently...

87
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,180
Where am...

88
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,550
Are you up?!

89
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,160
What? Who the heck are you?!

90
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,570
Where am I?

91
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,240
You're in my house. Now, calm down...

92
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,340
Don't mess with me!

93
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,410
Oh! You're scaring me.

94
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,880
It's not good to move around
so much. You're in bad shape.

95
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,210
--And the weather is...
--Stay away!

96
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,410
Bad shape or not, I'm getting out of here!

97
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,710
If I'm not there, they can't go anywhere.

98
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,800
--Quietly...
--Get lost!

99
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Forgive me.

100
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,520
--I can't help wanting to help you.
--I said get lost!

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,650
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

102
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,650
Hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl.

103
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,080
Little girl, who flew through
the sky to get here.

104
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,980
I heard you the first time. What do you want?

105
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,790
Are you calmed down a bit now?

106
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,590
Are you sure you're not
going to flip out again?

107
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,880
Yeah.

108
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,050
This is good!

109
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,610
No wonder. You were sleeping for
two days since you crashed here.

110
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,990
For that long?

111
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,210
Yes. You must have had a rough time, huh?

112
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,250
Ta-dah!

113
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,590
Let me show you something! These
are tightly tied Wind Knots!

114
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,630
If I untie one...

115
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,650
there is a gentle breeze.

116
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,730
If I untie two...

117
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,930
there is a strong wind.

118
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,500
If I untie three...

119
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,040
it really starts blowing!

120
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,440
What're you doing?!

121
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,030
I thought it might cheer you up.

122
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,190
Yeah, I'm really cheery now! Thank
you so much! I'm outta here!

123
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,660
Where are you going? It's
impossible, young girl!

124
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,510
This isn't so bad!

125
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm okay!

126
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,240
Looks like a huge cyclone is on its way!

127
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,420
Oh no, I told you!

128
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,910
You're covered in dirt.
Come in and take a shower!

129
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,900
In the meantime, I will
wash and dry your clothes.

130
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,470
Grandpa.

131
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,740
What?

132
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,840
This is not just a rain!

133
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,380
An enormous cyclone's approaching!

134
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,840
What? What did you say?

135
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm telling you that a storm
is coming! A gigantic one!

136
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,320
Oh yeah, this is true.

137
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,730
Maybe somebody else will fall out of the sky.

138
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,590
God! He's so irritating!

139
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,620
Whatever happens, I don't care!

140
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,150
What? What's this?

141
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,700
If you turn the wheel,
hot water will come out.

142
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,590
T-The wheel?

143
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,300
Clouds raining hot water? What's going on?!

144
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,670
How's the water temperature?

145
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,360
If you push the wheel, hot air comes out.

146
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,320
I made some tea.

147
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,200
Oh, thank you!

148
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,870
It's good!

149
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,820
Wait! What? Why're we so relaxed?!
I said "a storm is coming"!

150
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,630
You should really give a crap!

151
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,250
You have to calm down!

152
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,040
Are we really gonna be alright?

153
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,050
It is about time.

154
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,310
I'll be back soon. You wait
here quietly, young girl.

155
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,820
What?! H-Hey!

156
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,630
Wait!

157
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,740
How can he walk smoothly in this wind?

158
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,540
Here it is!

159
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,630
Cool Ball!

160
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,250
Heat Ball!

161
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,830
Here I go!

162
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,120
Cyclone Burst!

163
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,120
Whoa...

164
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,870
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

165
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,870
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, young girl!

166
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,360
I heard you the first time.

167
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,490
What?

168
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:55,280
Oh, you only saw it the one time
but you already used the Wind Knot.

169
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,750
You are impressive!

170
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,280
It's easy!

171
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,800
Okay, I got to go!

172
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,100
Wh-What is this?

173
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,800
Where... am I?!

174
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,800
This is a small Sky Island - Weatheria,

175
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,610
where scientific studies
of the weather are conducted.

176
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,230
S-Sky Island?!

177
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,530
That cyclone was going to be a good sample

178
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,620
but it suddenly disappeared.

179
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,470
I wonder who did such thing.

180
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,170
Nami was whisked away to
a small island in the sky.

181
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,350
Will she able to get back to her friends?

182
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,440
"A Winter Island on the Grand Line"

183
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,040
The storm's getting worse. Let's
take a break somewhere, Kitton.

184
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,350
Okay.

185
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,720
What's wrong, Taroimo?

186
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,280
--It's big!
--Kitton, back off!

187
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,380
W-Wait! Stop, Taroimo!

188
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,420
Wait!

189
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,720
He's human!

190
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,730
What do we do?!

191
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,480
E-Excuse me! Are you all right?

192
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,020
He thought that you were
something we were hunting.

193
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,100
Yeah, I'm fine!

194
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,210
How is that possible?!

195
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,580
Ah, so you are fine.

196
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,440
That's good, right? Taroimo.

197
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,210
But, damn!

198
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,500
How far did I come?

199
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,570
Oh, it's so cold! Is this the arctic?!

200
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,380
Franky!

201
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,140
Oh no! He's only in his
underwear in all this snow.

202
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,310
Have you been robbed?

203
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,050
Put this fur pelt on.

204
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,320
Fur pelts?! You got to be kidding! No thanks!

205
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,150
If I wore crap like that...

206
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,570
Aw! Nah, man, it wouldn't be
fitting for a pervert! Aw!

207
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,360
Hey, follow my lead!

208
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,580
Shake your hip to the right!

209
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,830
Right hand on your waist!
Stick out your left hand!

210
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,830
Slide and left!

211
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,000
Right! Left! Right! Left!
Right! Left! Right! Left!

212
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,550
Repeat! Aw!

213
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,780
One! Two! One! Two!

214
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,930
Right! Left! Right! Left!
Right! Left! Right! Left!

215
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,890
One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two!

216
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,310
Right! Left! Right! Left!
Right! Left! Right! Left!

217
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,610
Aw! One! Two! One! Two!

218
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,820
Ha!

219
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,430
Super!

220
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,400
Woo-hee! Great!

221
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,130
I'm still pretty cold! Where
the hell is this place?!

222
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,940
What?! You don't know where you are?

223
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,340
Why the hell would I know this place?!

224
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,380
You're on Mechanical Island,
Future Land Baldimore,

225
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,350
the birthplace of the genius.

226
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,040
--Degenerate?
--The genius.

227
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,350
The... Degenerate?

228
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,320
The genius.

229
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,030
Mister!

230
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,590
Geek! I mean, god!

231
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,580
Let's take him to the hospital, Kitton!

232
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,700
Okay.

233
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,020
"OPERATION IN PROGRESS"

234
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,740
So he is a cyborg.

235
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,820
I can't believe that his
energy source is cola.

236
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,720
What should we do?
We don't have any cola here.

237
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,530
There's no time to lose. Let's just begin.

238
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,870
Okay.

239
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,970
Mister!

240
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,080
Mister?

241
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,470
Hello! You're the boy from earlier, right?

242
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,870
I'm sorry to keep you waiting!

243
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,880
S-Something's different about you.

244
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,650
Yes! Unfortunately, they don't
have any cola here so...

245
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,680
...they used tea instead.

246
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,180
It's Darjeeling!

247
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,920
Tea?

248
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,780
It has a super flavor!

249
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,910
It makes me super relaxed!

250
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,310
M-Mister!

251
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,570
Oops! I'm sorry!

252
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,380
Here you go!
Be careful, it's hot.

253
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,360
No no! That's not what I was gonna say!

254
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,570
Mister! You were funnier
before and I miss it!

255
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,360
Oh yeah? What was I like?

256
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,780
Like this!

257
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,270
Super!

258
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,790
Kid.

259
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,170
--Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
--How can you even say something like that?

260
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,260
Franky becomes a gentleman
on Mechanical Island!

261
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,210
Will he ever be the same again?!

262
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,100
And what will happen to
the separated Straw Hats?!

263
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,870
Chopper awakens on an island

264
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,420
to find himself perpetually under attack
by giant birds and brawny natives,

265
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,160
landing him in a nasty crisis.

266
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,390
Meanwhile, Sanji awakens

267
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,550
on Peachy Island, the island of dreams,

268
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,100
where he has an encounter with
someone truly frightening.

269
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,590
On the next episode of One Piece!

270
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,060
"The Friends' Whereabouts! An Island
of Giant Birds and a Pink Paradise!"

271
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
