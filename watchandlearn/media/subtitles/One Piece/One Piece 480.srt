2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,070
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,030
He and the Whitebeards finally got over the

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,380
encircling walls to make it to the scaffold!

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,980
In the midst of the Navy's onslaught,

64
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,540
Luffy runs toward Ace with
the Whitebeards' assistance!

65
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,630
You guys!

66
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,590
Pops?!

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,010
From now on, back Straw Hat Luffy up...

68
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,760
...with all your strength!

69
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,320
They made a path!

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,990
I'm here, Ace!

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,840
Grandpa! Move out of my way!

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm not going to move!

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,100
Because I'm a vice admiral of the Navy!

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,020
I've been fighting against pirates
since long before you were born!

75
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,730
Old man!

76
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,320
If you wanna pass through here,
you have to kill me first!

77
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,110
Straw Hat Luffy!

78
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,540
Because of the path you two...

79
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,870
...have chosen to live!!

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,640
"Each on Different Paths! Luffy vs. Garp!"

81
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,220
Please, grandpa! Just let me go by!

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,030
Luffy!

83
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,000
C-Coby! S-Stay with me, Coby!

84
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,760
Damn Straw Hat!

85
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,930
How could he do this to Coby without mercy?!

86
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,020
I'll make him pay!

87
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,270
I-I have to become...

88
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,230
...much much stronger...

89
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,280
Y-Y-You are alive! I'm so relieved!

90
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,450
Where's Luffy-san?

91
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,670
That damn Straw Hat is...

92
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,250
...being blocked by Vice Admiral Garp!

93
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,880
Are they really gonna fight?!

94
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,550
Luffy-san!

95
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,760
Straw Hat is heading to the scaffold! Dammit!

96
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,890
It's easy to get him from this distance!

97
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,910
Aim at Straw Hat Luffy!

98
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,360
You impertinent fools!

99
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,110
Stand back!

100
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,080
Slave Arrow!

101
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,120
--We...
--Love...

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,700
--You...

103
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,380
Pirate empress! Whose
side are you really on?!

104
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,840
Of course, Luffy's...

105
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,340
...but what if you hit Vice Admiral
Garp with a stray bullet?!

106
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,970
--What?!
--N-No!

107
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,920
Vice Admiral Garp! He is none other than...

108
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,770
...my grandfather!

109
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,560
--Your grandfather?!
--Vice Admiral Garp?!

110
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,530
If I get married with Luffy, then of
course, he becomes my grandfather!

111
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,350
--It's just...
--...In your head!

112
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,370
You gotta find a way, Straw Hat!
Hurry up before the bridge collapses!

113
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,080
Straw Hat!

114
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,960
Luffy-kun!

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,390
Luffy! Straw Hat Luffy!

116
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,810
Like I said, if you wanna pass through
here, you have to kill me first!

117
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,620
Ouch!

118
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,160
You bastard!

119
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,210
Grandpa!

120
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,550
Why do you want me to fight with these guys?!

121
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,800
That's your training!

122
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,060
My training?!

123
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,760
It just makes me hungry and I
don't wanna get hit anymore!

124
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,730
Don't be such a baby!

125
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,400
You got to become the strongest Navy soldier!

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm gonna become a pirate,
not a Navy soldier!

127
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,580
Huh?

128
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,620
You fool!

129
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,500
Ouch!

130
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Nothing's more painful than grandpa's fist!

131
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,070
Gum-Gum...

132
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,070
What a fool...

133
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,330
I gotta tell you something!

134
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,490
What is it?

135
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm not gonna become a pirate!

136
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,670
You finally got it!

137
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm not gonna become just a pirate,

138
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

139
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,720
You can't be influenced
by "Red-Haired" like that!

140
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,510
You're dismissed! I got to
beat some character into him!

141
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,190
Grandpa!

142
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,190
I'm not gonna let you become
a pirate at any cost!

143
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,060
Although you're worn out and sleeping,
your stomach is active as always.

144
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,740
I guess you must hate a grandpa
like me; so intimidating.

145
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,030
But Luffy,

146
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,290
the reason that I'm training you
so harshly to become a Navy soldier is...

147
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,750
...that I don't want you to stray
from the right path at any price.

148
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,120
That is my wish.

149
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,810
Luffy, we'll have a great dinner tonight

150
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,670
because I swiped plenty from the Navy.

151
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,570
You can eat as much meat as you want!

152
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,820
Grandpa...

153
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,460
I can't do it, grandpa! Move out of my way!

154
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,370
If you can't, Ace will die!

155
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,080
No way!

156
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,710
Things don't always go as you want!
I'm not gonna have mercy on you!

157
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,680
Luffy, I consider you...

158
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,720
...my enemy!

159
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,000
Luffy!

160
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,280
Garp!

161
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,630
Dammit! My mind is so warped!
It's not the right time for this!

162
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,970
Pops and brother and friends are...

163
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,720
...going down one by one bleeding, but...

164
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,350
I'm so happy that I can't hold back my tears!

165
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,900
At this last moment, I'm starting
to think that I wanna live!

166
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,830
Vice Admiral Garp!

167
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,610
Old man!

168
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,760
You're their parent after all, Garp.

169
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,480
He is about to get to the scaffold!

170
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,360
You called him a reckless piece of crap!

171
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,030
He is reckless!

172
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,700
I wonder how he can set "Fire Fist" Ace free.

173
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Get lost! You fool!

174
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,830
You're not careful.

175
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,960
Pops!

176
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,820
Finally... finally...

177
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,280
I made it!

178
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,960
Luffy!

179
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,240
You're so...!

180
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,500
Ace!

181
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,060
Hold on!

182
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,140
Take this.

183
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,560
It's your brother's handcuff key.

184
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,690
I have the key!

185
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,030
Luffy, how did you...?!

186
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,800
Wh-What the hell is that?!

187
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,310
--Look! Fleet Admiral Sengoku is using his power!
--I've never seen it before!

188
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,490
You can't get away from me!

189
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,330
Sengoku!

190
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,460
A giant Buddha!

191
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,880
I can't believe that you even have
such a thing, Straw Hat Luffy!

192
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,240
Oh no, the key!

193
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,680
Get ready!

194
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,980
Aim at them and be ready to
fire at a moment's notice!

195
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,730
No way, the key...!

196
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,120
Straw Hat Luffy!

197
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,820
You're a serious criminal who
should be punished by death, too!

198
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,700
I'm gonna execute both of you
brothers with my own bare hands!

199
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,750
What was that? I passed
out all of a sudden...

200
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,800
Straw Hat... Oh!

201
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,320
San! Why are you here?!

202
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,110
What is that?!

203
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,700
Hey, San! Protect Ace with a wall!

204
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,860
Gum-Gum...

205
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,160
...Giant Balloon!

206
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,170
Candle Wall!

207
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,290
Is he expanding?!

208
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,560
--The scaffold is collapsing!
--What happened?!

209
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,350
Ace is still alive!

210
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,330
We're falling!

211
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,780
I'll make the key! Uncuff him right away!

212
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,990
Alright!

213
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,310
Captain Buggy! There's brother 3!

214
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,740
What?! What is he doing in
that ridiculous costume?!

215
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,080
I thought he ran away from here already!

216
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,220
The execution of "Fire Fist" Ace has
to do with the prestige of the Navy HQ!

217
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,050
We have to finish it!

218
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,600
That was...

219
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,560
...the executioners!

220
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,890
Ring, ring, ring... Clank!

221
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,110
Oh, that's good! Admiral Borsalino
stopped Straw Hat in the plaza!

222
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,900
Straw Hat?!

223
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,800
You gotta save your brother at any cost!

224
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,660
Mr. 2...!

225
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,660
Okay, what should we do now?

226
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,750
We're gonna rescue Straw-chan!

227
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,630
Because I'm his friend! I
don't need any other reasons!

228
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,420
Friends?

229
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,970
Bon-chan, the gate's closing.

230
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,720
We... have to go.

231
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,440
Thank you!

232
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,110
Straw-chan!

233
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,980
--Bon-chan!
--Straw-chan!

234
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,610
You gotta save your brother at any cost!

235
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,960
He never ran away.

236
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,690
He honored his friendship with Straw Hat!

237
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,190
Okay guys, hurry up and get ready!

238
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,390
Yes, sir!

239
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,320
Where's the other guy?!
What's taking him so long?!

240
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,200
Since it was such short notice, he's
having trouble getting ready...

241
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,520
Hey, hurry up!

242
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,160
Alright, let's go!

243
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:23,170
If I tell you that I'm here out
of respect for my late comrade,

244
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,170
are you going to laugh at me?!

245
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,050
No, I won't!

246
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,770
Fire! Blow them away!

247
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,600
Save your brother, Straw Hat!

248
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,060
Okay!

249
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,420
Oh no!

250
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,830
Straw boy!

251
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,080
No way!

252
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,460
Ace!

253
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,550
--Brother 3!
--They all got hit!

254
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,940
"Fire Fist" can't use his power because of
the Sea Prism Stone handcuffs!

255
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,320
He's dead!

256
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,810
And we got Straw Hat, too!

257
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,870
There's a tunnel of fire in the smoke!

258
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,120
You've always been like this!

259
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,000
Luffy!

260
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,920
You've never even listened to me...

261
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,550
...and always done such crazy things!

262
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,850
--Good!
--Oh my!

263
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,180
Ace!

264
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,850
I-I can't believe it!

265
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,950
Straw Hat and brother 3 are alive, too!

266
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,950
Ace!!

267
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,760
Ace is free at last!

268
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
Seeing Ace and Luffy taking on the Navy
in such a well-synchronized combination

269
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,970
raises the morale of the Whitebeard Pirates.

270
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,170
But Whitebeard, looking to a
future still farther ahead,

271
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,350
comes to a decision of his own.

272
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

273
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,090
"Ace Rescued! Whitebeard's Final Order!"

274
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
