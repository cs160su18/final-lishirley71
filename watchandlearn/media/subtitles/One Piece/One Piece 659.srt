00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:49,780
We will keep making our own route

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:12,670
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,950
and if that makes you feel something - that's the treasure

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,680

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,950
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

60
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,120
The bond with potential power will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,120

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,690
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,960
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,680
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,430
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,370
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,370
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,680
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,990
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Luffy entered a fighting competition - in which a winner will
get the Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize - and won the first round.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,870
And while the last match of the first round is on,
the losers are...

75
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,760
You're...

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,200
I mean, you, sir, are...

77
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,510
...King Riku-sama, aren't you?

78
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,780
Since I'm deep underground now,

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,440
I no longer need to disguise myself.

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,910
"A Horrible Past!
The Secret of Dressrosa!"

81
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,890
THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

82
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,890
Luffy-senpai!

83
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,560
Oh?! You must be...

84
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,330
Oh, wait! No! My name is Lucy!

85
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,670
That's not important now...

86
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,670
Oh, I can't!
I'm too nervous to even speak.

87
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,480
If you've got nothing to say, I'm gonna go now.
I wanna go support Rebecca.

88
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,810
Don't go!

89
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,950
I was asked by Z-Z-Zoro-senpai!

90
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,920
What?! By Zoro?!

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,260
Yes!
He asked me to bring Luffy-senpai to him!

92
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,560
I see! Where is he?

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
H-He's outside of the Colosseum.

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,740
I-I'm gonna show you! This way!

95
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,870
Okay!
I'm counting on you, Crest Head!

96
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,410
"Counting on you, Crest Head"?!
Luffy-senpai's counting on me and...

97
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,620
I'm counting on you, Crest Head!

98
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,480
...he gave me a nickname!
That means...

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm counting on you, Crest Head!

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,150
...I'm Luffy-senpai's friend now?!

101
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,660
Hey, what's wrong?

102
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,510
Heated fights are going on
in the battle royal of Block D!

103
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,450
She's so persistent! Very tenacious!
The contender - Rebecca!

104
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,800
Watching her not-unbeautiful fighting style
makes me...

105
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,210
...wanna not unsupport her!

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,650
I'm Rebecca's real father!

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,660
THE KING RIKU ARMY HEADQUARTERS

108
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,710
A-Are you?!

109
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,980
Drop dead already, Rebecca!

110
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,350
--You kin of King Riku!
--Part of that evil family!

111
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,660
Granddaughter of the pyromaniac!
Go to hell!

112
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,180
If you're her father...

113
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,900
If you're telling the truth,
since she's King Riku's granddaughter...

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,140
When you were a human,
don't tell me you were...

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,570
Everything started that night.

116
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,610
Hey, answer my question!

117
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,560
Were you King Riku's...

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,950
No, it might
have started long before.

119
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,250
Since the day a woman named Monet
started to work at the palace...

120
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,050
What?

121
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,420
Monet?!

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,260
The bird woman that we encountered
in Punk Hazard?

123
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,600
This country has changed
in a big way last decade.

124
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,970
Both the scenery and the people!

125
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,140
DRESSROSA - 10 YEARS AGO

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,140
Hey, what happened?

127
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,140
Some pirates did this.

128
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,650
But the King Riku Army fought for us
so we got away with this little damage.

129
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,350
Oh, the King Riku Army!

130
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,260
I have a message from King Riku-sama.

131
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,360
What? From King-sama?!

132
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,800
"I'm sorry that I couldn't protect
my dear citizen's house from the pirates."

133
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,970
"The King Riku Army will handle
the repair of your house."

134
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,530
--That's more than we deserve!
--Don't worry. Guys, get to work!

135
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,440
Alright! Let's help them!

136
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,820
Yeah! We help each another when someone's in trouble.

137
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,550
That's what King Riku-sama always says!

138
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,280
Okay! Let's do it together!

139
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,600
It's been two weeks without rain.

140
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Yeah but even during this drought,
the flowers don't die.

141
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,570
Why is that?

142
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,910
It's thanks to the fairies.

143
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,110
They are protecting the flowers.

144
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,210
I wanna eat more!

145
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,460
--If you have energy to shout, you're fine.
--What?

146
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,020
Although we're very poor,
we don't have to fight in a war in this country.

147
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,220
That's the best thing. Don't you think so?

148
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,070
Uh-huh!

149
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,860
For 800 years
under the reign of the Riku Family,

150
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,530
this country had never been involved
in a war.

151
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,770
That's amazing.

152
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,660
Yeah.
It's miraculous for a country.

153
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,580
Even though the country was poor,
the people and fairies all helped each other

154
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,610
and were rich in spirit.

155
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,020
Dressrosa was a very peaceful country.
However...

156
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,060
A "nightmare" came flying to the palace
out of the blue!

157
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,660
Who are you?

158
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,410
Don't try to scream or call for help.

159
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,780
Y-You are...

160
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,950
My name is Don Quixote Doflamingo.

161
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,020
I guess you know what my name suggests,
don't you?

162
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,200
I've been troubled by hearing
about a pirate named Don Quixote these days.

163
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,470
Yes, you were right to be troubled.

164
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,870
I'm a descendent of the Don Quixote Family
that once governed this country.

165
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,350
I am the rightful king of this country!
And now, I'm...

166
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,380
...back!

167
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,790
But you robbed a transport ship
of the Heavenly Tribute

168
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,290
of money for the Celestial Dragons
from various countries

169
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,290
and became a Warlord by blackmailing
the World Government, I heard.

170
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,300
They don't know what to do with me.

171
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,870
They can't handle me
because I'm not afraid of the Celestial Dragons.

172
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,640
Since you know my status and what I'm capable of,
I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

173
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,240
I want my country back!

174
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,250
If you refuse,
there's gonna be bloody mess in Dressrosa.

175
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,860
But I'm not a devil.
I know you don't like to fight.

176
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,960
So...

177
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to sell you this country
for 10 billion berries.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,420
You're gonna sell this country for money?!

179
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,930
I can just...

180
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,540
...take it back from you
without giving you such an opportunity.

181
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,070
If we can avoid a war by paying money,
I'd like to do so.

182
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,780
But 10 billion berries is a lot of money!
We don't have that much...

183
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,020
Yes, you do!

184
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,160
Scrape it up from your dear citizens.

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
What?!

186
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,450
I'm expecting to have it
by the break of dawn tomorrow.

187
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,230
You can't get aid from other countries.
Prove your worth as a king.

188
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,460
And you can't tell your citizens about me.

189
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,910
You only have two choices.

190
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,210
Collect money to avoid a war or...

191
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,970
...fight me and see
your citizens bathed in blood.

192
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,650
Pick the one that you want.

193
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,880
Can't we fight Doflamingo, King-sama?!

194
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,720
No! Fighting may sound good
but humans should not kill each other!

195
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,710
But it's hard to collect that much money!
There aren't that many rich people in this country!

196
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,750
We shouldn't have to pay the family
that once abandoned this country in the first place!

197
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,650
If it means war, we're gonna fight...

198
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:12,550
For 800 years, Dressrosa has never fought a war.
It proves we're not beasts!

199
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,090
Don't become a brute! Be a human!
I won't let you kill anybody!

200
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,200
--But...
--Captain Tank!

201
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,230
I know you have a lot to say.

202
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,540
But what we value the most is
the citizens' lives.

203
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,840
I know you feel the same way.

204
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,370
I beg you!

205
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,620
We soldiers of the King Riku Army
truly believe in you

206
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,850
and do as you tell us to.

207
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,590
And we take pride in it!

208
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,960
Tank, thank you for saying that.

209
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,230
No.

210
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,440
Please forgive me for being disrespectful.

211
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,280
Listen! We don't have much time!
Split up in units and go to different towns!

212
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,040
Collect 10 billion from all over the country.

213
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,550
If we can't do it,
this country will be taken over by the pirate.

214
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,720
We're going to lose the trust of the citizens
by collecting their money.

215
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,640
But it's just for several hours!

216
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,830
When everything is over,
we'll make it up for them sincerely!

217
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,460
That's the only way!
There's no fooling anyone to get out of this!

218
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,670
Collect as much as you can!
The country is on the line!

219
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,400
Yeah!

220
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,140
Let's go! Follow my lead!

221
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,940
Yeah!

222
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,420
--It's the Army.
--What are they doing this late?

223
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,590
That's Captain Tank!

224
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,430
Stop!

225
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,670
Listen, everyone!

226
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,240
Bring all the money you have
in this town here!

227
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,680
--Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?
--What's going on?

228
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,210
--Just bring it!
--Hurry up!

229
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,650
King-sama will be furious with you
if he hears about this!

230
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,660
This is...

231
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,310
...the king's order!

232
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,770
King-sama will be furious with you
if he hears about this!

233
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,410
This is the king's order!

234
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,410
Hurry up! We can't tell you what's going on
and we don't have time!

235
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:57,550
Just believe in King-sama
and bring all the money you have here!

236
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,760
That's too sudden.

237
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,760
It's impossible!
No one's gonna accept such a request!

238
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,160
The Video Transponder Snail?

239
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,370
Nation of Dressrosa!

240
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,530
King Riku-sama!

241
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,700
It's King Riku-sama!

242
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,170
I know it's too sudden
and an unreasonable request.

243
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,850
But please let me borrow all of your money
from all of you people...

244
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,480
...without asking me for a reason!

245
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,650
The king is bowing his head!

246
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,090
King Riku-sama!

247
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,920
But why is he doing this?

248
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,160
It's really too sudden!

249
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,730
King-sama, stop bowing your head!

250
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,000
You shouldn't be doing that!
You're the king!

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,170
--Please stop!
--Lift your head!

252
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,790
The successive kings will be ashamed of you
for doing such a thing!

253
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,340
--King-sama!
--Why do you have to do that!

254
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,010
You're humiliating yourself in front of the whole world!
Just stop!

255
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,580
King-sama!

256
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,240
Please! This is not some kind of joke!

257
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:11,560
I don't mind cutting
my arm or leg off to prove it!

258
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,080
Listen, Tank.

259
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,570
If things go wrong,
I will kill even just Doflamingo.

260
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,340
King Riku-sama, is that...

261
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,140
I'll leave the rest up to you.

262
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,050
To live up to his expectations,

263
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,270
I'll collect the money at any cost!

264
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,340
Even if I lose...

265
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,840
...the trust of the people in me
as a military captain!

266
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,170
I am begging you!

267
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,480
Hurry up, everyone!
Let's bring all the money we got as the king says!

268
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,620
Yeah! King Riku is such a kind-hearted man!
He wouldn't do this out of ill intent!

269
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,500
That's right!
There must be a reason for this!

270
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,020
--Bring all your money!
--All right!

271
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,570
The king's virtue made it possible!

272
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,160
Here!

273
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,570
Thank you!

274
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,900
I'm sorry!

275
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,730
They're doing it out of their trust
in the eight centuries of the Riku Family's reign.

276
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,830
How wonderful this country is!
It will be saved for sure!

277
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,920
Thank you!

278
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,150
King Riku-sama!

279
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,070
Long live King Riku-sama!

280
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,960
Thank you all.

281
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,540
Take all the money to the palace!

282
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,070
--Hurry up!
--Yes, sir!

283
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,780
--Captain Tank!
--What's wrong?!

284
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,930
--King-sama is in the town of Sevio!
--It's on the screen!

285
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,150
What?!

286
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,050
THE TOWN IN THE SOUTH - SEVIO

287
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,580
King-sama!
You didn't have to come all the way! We're gonna...

288
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,990
Get away!

289
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,960
What?!

290
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,620
It's King-sama!

291
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,290
King Riku-sama! We don't know what the deal is
but we trust you so...

292
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,840
Get away!

293
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,960
What?

294
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,230
Get away from me!

295
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,200
What?!
King Riku-sama, what are you...

296
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,210
Don't! There is a magazine!

297
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,230
King Riku-sama!

298
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,290
King Riku-sama?

299
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,650
Stop! Don't make me do this!

300
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,730
--King Riku-sama, please stop!
--What are you doing?!

301
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,290
Back off! Stay away from me!

302
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,790
Get away from me!

303
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,960
He cut the soldiers, too!

304
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,670
My body is moving on its own!

305
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,380
What are you doing?

306
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,120
King Riku-sama!

307
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,000
Boy... What kind of king he is!

308
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,460
Well, the night has just begun, soldiers.

309
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,900
You should dance, too!

310
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,780
Parasite String!

311
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,250
Wh-What the hell? What's going on?!
M-My arm is moving on its own!

312
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,020
What?

313
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,690
The soldiers are rampaging now, too!

314
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Stop it!

315
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,860
Help me...

316
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,800
C-Captain!

317
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,230
It's not me!

318
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,870
I-I can't control my body!

319
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,940
I know!
That's what's happening to me!

320
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,910
Why does it move on its own?!

321
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,610
Is it what's happening to King-sama?!

322
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,020
King Riku-sama, why are you doing this?!

323
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,880
He's never done anything wrong up
til now!

324
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,590
Did we do something?!

325
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,620
There's no way to justify myself!

326
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,600
This country is finished!

327
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,700
Doflamingo set us up!

328
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,100
--What happened to the king?!
--Please stop!

329
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,870
Hey, hey!
Can we do it already, Doffy?

330
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,410
Idiot. Don't rush.

331
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,980
I have to make the people tremble
with fear more

332
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,350
and get them hate King Riku
with all their heart!

333
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,990
And then, the heroes will appear!
