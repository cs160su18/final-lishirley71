00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,540
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,980
What're you doing, old guy?!
Move this rock!

22
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,650
Perfect timing!

23
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,250
What're you doing here, anyway?

24
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,950
What's the deal, Nami?

25
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,550
Dinosaur!

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,630
There's someone on this island!

27
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,230
Who is it?!

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,370
Why, you...!

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,650
10,000 Kilogram Press!

30
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:58,290
Mr. 3. Please excuse the codename.
I'm a mere formative artist.

31
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,830
And this is my realist painter assistant,
Miss Golden Week.

32
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,100
Mr. 3?! The Wax-Wax Fruit man?!

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,670
He's a "candle man" who controls
the wax he secretes from his body.

34
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,870
You guys are gonna pay for this!

35
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,130
"The Devilish Candle!
Tears of Regret and Tears of Anger"

36
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,450
Curse you! What are you doing?!

37
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,880
What am I doing?

38
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,620
This is why I can't stand
unsophisticated dolts.

39
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,490
I'm creating a work of art, obviously.

40
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,130
Just be a good little girl.

41
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,840
Did you honestly think you
could escape from Baroque Works?

42
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Especially when someone with a
30 million-Berry bounty winds up like that?

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,450
I'm happy I could thank them
for what happened at Whisky Peak.

44
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,320
You wannabe pirates should
never have stuck your noses

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,160
into such delicate issues as this.

46
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,260
We've already captured your
swordsman friend and the other girl.

47
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,830
You caught Zoro?

48
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,740
Then you guys're gonna get cut down!

49
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,770
Oh?

50
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,840
You still talk big,

51
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,010
even after one of my
Kicky Bombs to the face?

52
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,110
You can't hurt me with that!

53
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,550
I'm gonna kick you guys' asses!

54
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,190
Unbelievable.

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,790
Luffy-san!

56
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,030
Die!

57
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,650
--Fool!
--Luffy-san!

58
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,920
Luffy-san! Luffy-san!

59
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,590
Let's go, Miss Valentine.

60
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,620
Luffy-san!

61
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,290
Usopp-san! Karoo!

62
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,380
Damn you...

63
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,780
Give it up! Give it up!

64
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:21,060
Once solidified,
my Candle Jacket is as hard as iron!

65
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,460
You giants may have brutish strength,

66
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,630
but it becomes all but useless
once you've been caught.

67
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,870
Using your brain is the key.

68
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,700
There's no need to
uselessly face you head-on.

69
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,610
You lowered your guard
as you reveled in victory,

70
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,880
Red Ogre Broggy.

71
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,980
Don't glare at me like that.
You're terrifying me so!

72
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,920
You should be happy! Your long,
long battle has come to an end!

73
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,430
You fought for a whole century
for your so-called pride, right?

74
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,130
Shouldn't the taste of victory
be especially sweet, then?

75
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,040
Even if it is the fruit
of others' assistance...

76
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,670
Am I wrong?

77
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,770
Damn you! You don't mean to say...!

78
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,380
But the final victory belongs to me!

79
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,750
Are you aware that the large
bounties on your heads from long ago

80
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,490
come to 200 million Berries total?

81
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,360
Even today this holds true!

82
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,390
Why, you...!

83
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,430
I feel as if I've discovered
a long-lost treasure!

84
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,370
So that's what you're after, huh?!

85
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,600
Mr. 3!

86
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,440
We brought her.

87
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,340
Our company's little traitor.

88
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,080
What took so long?
I was getting sick of waiting.

89
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,610
Your methods are too underhanded, Mr. 3!

90
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,450
Planting bombs in Dorry-san's alcohol...!

91
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,250
What?!

92
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,050
Alcohol?

93
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,090
The alcohol I gave him?!

94
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,330
Dorry! How was your drink?!
Hit the spot, didn't it?!

95
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,370
Yeah... It tasted "godly"...

96
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,340
That's what you meant, Dorry?!

97
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Wretched little girl,
giving our tricks away.

98
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,950
Well, no matter.
There's nothing you can do now, anyway.

99
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,820
Candle...

100
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,280
...Lock!

101
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,630
Mr. 5!

102
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,500
Bring the swordsman and the girl!

103
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,470
We're about to begin!

104
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,310
Extra Big Candle Set!

105
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,550
T-This is Mr. 3's ability?!

106
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,020
What's going on?!

107
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,720
Here they are.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
How naive.

109
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,970
Being ridiculed by people of
their caliber is so embarrassing

110
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,640
that I'm pissed at myself.

111
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,410
You can't help that you're weak.

112
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,980
Huh? What was that?

113
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,310
Nothing! Just set
the candles up quickly!

114
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,680
Set?

115
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,950
What is that?!

116
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,550
Nami-san... Mr. Bushido...

117
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,290
Vivi! What happened?!
Weren't you with Luffy?!

118
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,990
Yes, I was, but...

119
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,930
If you're wondering about Straw Hat,
I took care of him myself!

120
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,300
It was an easy job, too.

121
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,800
You did?

122
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,440
Welcome, friends, to my service set!

123
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,600
Is this how it feels to be
a candle stuck in a cake?

124
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,000
What's that spinning thing up there?

125
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,300
And I can't move my legs...

126
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,370
Of course they're not gonna let us move.

127
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,310
They're the enemy.

128
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,910
Damn. It's hard.

129
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,920
Plus I can't put any strength
into it from this stance.

130
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,550
Something's raining down!

131
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,060
May you enjoy my "Candle Service"!

132
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,790
The wax haze falling from above you

133
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,230
will eventually change
you into wax figures!

134
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,700
You'll become perfect "human models"

135
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,040
that not even I could
achieve with my skills!

136
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,380
Your wax figures will have
literally captured your spirit!

137
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,110
Now die, in the name of art.

138
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,720
Screw that!

139
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,920
Why do we have to turn
into your works of art?!

140
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,760
Broggy-san! Quit sitting
there and go on a rampage!

141
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,460
You're gonna get turned into
a wax figure too, you know!

142
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,130
Man, talk about a huge person...

143
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,470
Anything you say to him is pointless!

144
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:43,370
He just now realized he foolishly
shed proud, joyful tears of victory

145
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,840
after killing his friend Dorry,
with whom he fought for 100 years,

146
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:54,780
but without even noticing that he
had suffered injuries beforehand!

147
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,390
Or did you perhaps cry
for your friend, instead?

148
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,230
Whatever the case, there's no
undoing what you've done now, fool!

149
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,840
I knew...

150
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,740
I knew about it.

151
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,780
From the moment we
first exchanged blows...

152
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,390
...I knew Dorry was hiding something.

153
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,860
You knew, huh?

154
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,260
You lie!

155
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,060
If so, then why didn't
you cease your fighting?

156
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,900
I didn't see a shred of pity in
the way you heartily cut him down!

157
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,040
A pipsqueak who doesn't even
know the first thing about duels

158
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,940
would never understand
the meaning of those tears!

159
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,550
What would you know?!

160
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,020
Are you saying I should shame a warrior

161
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,220
who hides the fact he's been
weakened and tries to fight anyway?!

162
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,360
A warrior who'll go that far to
keep fighting doesn't deserve pity!

163
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,570
And now... I know the reason behind it.

164
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,240
Now that I know, I'm going to
finish things with my own two hands!

165
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,750
That's the very least I can
do for my dear friend Dorry!

166
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,520
Broggy-san!

167
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,770
--Broggy-san!
--Broggy-san!

168
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,640
What an annoying, talkative monster.

169
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,980
U-Usopp...

170
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,650
Usopp...

171
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,360
Can you let them get away with this?

172
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,690
No... I can't...

173
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,910
Can you... not stand this?

174
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,020
Alright! Let's all three of us
go beat them senseless!

175
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,190
Broggy-san!

176
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,260
How dumb!

177
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:53,230
I underestimated how brutishly
strong these giants can be!

178
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,930
It would seem you need
to be seized completely!

179
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,270
Wax-Wax Arts! Handcuffs!

180
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,770
I'm just getting started!

181
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,420
And now for the finishing touch!

182
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,820
Take this!

183
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,130
Can't move now, can you?!

184
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,840
How can he be so horrific?!

185
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,180
Now, then! Accelerate, Candle Service!

186
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,250
Turn these people into wax figures!

187
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,460
M-My chest is starting to hurt...

188
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,790
The wax haze is getting into our lungs!

189
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,090
At this rate, we're going to turn
into wax figures from the inside out!

190
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,600
Yes! Yes! Make it look like
you're in as much pain as you can!

191
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:11,010
Expressions of pain and agony
are the very things I seek in art!

192
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,440
May you solidify
while filled with terror!

193
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,110
You call this art,
you creepy topknot freak?!

194
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,120
How dare you do that to Broggy-san?!

195
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,420
You guys are going to
regret this! You got that?!

196
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,960
Scream and holler all you want!

197
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,870
For 100 years...

198
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,980
...day in and day out,
we fought and fought...

199
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,720
...and dueled only because of our
pride of Elbaf, village of warriors!

200
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,090
Yet... why are we being subjected
to this, Elbaf, god of war?!

201
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,930
If this is how we're
to meet our end, Elbaf...

202
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,170
...don't you think it's unfair?!

203
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,840
Why won't you let us die in battle?!

204
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,940
What a look!

205
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,350
Yes! That sorrow!
That grief! That struggle!

206
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,820
What a marvelous work of art!

207
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,150
Elbaf!

208
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,890
Oh no! My hands won't move!

209
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,390
I don't wanna die this way!
Can't we do something?!

210
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,490
My body's already turning stiff!

211
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,090
What do we do?!

212
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,560
Zoro! Do something!

213
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,600
Hey, old man.

214
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,900
You can still move, can't you?

215
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,940
So can I.

216
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,480
Whadya say we crush these guys together?

217
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,580
Hold on, Zoro! What are you doing?!
You're not seriously gonna--!

218
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,320
Yeah.

219
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,790
You're gonna cut your own legs?!
Quit joking around!

220
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,090
It's no joke.
It's the only way out of here.

221
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,090
What're you two gonna do?

222
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,630
What are you talking about?!
It's pointless!

223
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,560
Even if you do get down from here
that way, they'll catch you again!

224
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,030
There's no way to
know that unless we try!

225
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,030
We're gonna kick the bucket
if we stay here anyway.

226
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,040
So let's put up some ugly struggling!

227
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,470
There's no reason to die heroically
for these pieces of scum!

228
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,710
Right?!

229
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,450
What the hell? Is he crazy?

230
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,150
He's bluffing!
There's no way he could do that!

231
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,920
He's merely acting tough!

232
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,460
What a cheeky runt.

233
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,390
I'm pathetic. It seems I had
even lost the will to fight.

234
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,700
I'll fight alongside you
and your fighting spirit!

235
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,340
You can't be serious, right?!

236
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,570
How will you be able
to fight afterward?!

237
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,080
Who knows?

238
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,410
But... I plan to win.

239
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,420
Who are these guys?!
They're off their rocker!

240
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,150
What kind of man is he?!

241
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,190
But I've seen this
look somewhere before...

242
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,060
Princess Vivi!

243
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,030
Are you prepared not to die?

244
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,560
W-Wait! I'll fight, too!

245
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,000
--Vivi!
--Alright, then.

246
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,370
Let's do it, runt!

247
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,610
Don't be stupid!
What can you possibly do?!

248
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,780
Hey, you guys!

249
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm gonna kick your asses,
just so you know!

250
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,360
What?

251
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,760
--Let's do it, Usopp!
--Yeah!

252
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,560
Bird!

253
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,630
Luffy! Usopp!

254
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,770
Karoo!

255
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,770
Master Broggy!
We've taken on your frustration!

256
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,870
Usopp...

257
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,340
Beat those guys up so much
they lose their original forms

258
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,810
and send them flying far off somewhere!

259
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,710
Yeah! I will!

260
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,980
These guys spoiled
the old giant guys' duel!

261
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,590
So you're the one with the
highest bounty in the East Blue?

262
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,460
My, how Navy Headquarters'
standards have fallen!

263
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,930
--Whoa! What a weird head!
--Quiet, you!

264
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,430
--It's the number 3, and it's on fire!
--Shut up!

265
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,260
Break this pillar first, Luffy!

266
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,000
We're about to turn into wax figures!

267
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
Oh? You're in trouble?

268
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,640
No, there was no problem at all.

269
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,110
Hey! Your leg!

270
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,110
Yeah. I went about
halfway through, I'd say.

271
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,450
How is that no problem at all?!

272
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,750
For now, could you bust
this pillar for us, Luffy?

273
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,950
I leave the rest to you.

274
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,350
Alright, no problem!

275
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,760
I wouldn't be so sure.

276
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,030
Dunno what it is,
but let's break that thing!

277
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,460
Alright! Got it!

278
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,400
I'm a bit of a different person today!

279
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,640
Hurry it up! We're gonna solidify!

280
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

281
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

282
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

283
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

284
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,420
So even...

285
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,630
...if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

286
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,840
the ship will continue forward

287
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,940
Bon voyage!

288
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget about them!

289
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,950
I know I'm a fool, but I gotta go

290
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,620
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

291
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,290
I know I'm a fool, but I'm gonna fight

292
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,300
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

293
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,570
Do everything you can, and you'll
get a little nearer to any horizon

294
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,980
Gum-Gum Mallet!

295
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,820
Alright! The pillar broke!

296
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,990
Huh? Why didn't you run away?

297
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,250
We can't move!

298
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,450
The wax has us stuck!

299
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,920
Oh, that's why?

300
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,390
Hurry and break this set!

301
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,260
No.

302
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,960
Quit joking and hurry up!

303
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,000
What should I do?
I don't feel like saving you guys!

304
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,300
On the next episode of One Piece!

305
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,170
"A Hex on Luffy! Colors Trap"

306
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
