00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,010
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,730
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,230
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,410
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,480
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,990
Are you insane?! Don't think
that you'll be able to survive

35
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,850
after making the entire world your enemy!

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,690
I'll pursue that woman to the very
ends of the earth and eliminate her...

37
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,360
I want to live!

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:07,690
...Jet... Gatling!

39
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,080
Luffy!

40
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,870
Luffy...!

41
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,830
The first column is...!

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,370
Th-This is a report to all ships.

43
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,920
This is a report to all ships!

44
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,090
Mr. Rob Lucci of CP9 has just...

45
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,930
Has just been defeated...
by pirate Straw Hat Luffy!

46
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,730
Luffy...

47
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,920
It's over...

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,200
We'll be okay now.

49
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,580
We're gonna go back together!

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,050
Robin!

51
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,930
"From the Sea, a Friend Arrives!
The Straw Hats Share the Strongest Bond"

52
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,490
Th...

53
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,740
Th-This can't be happening!

54
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,080
Mr. Rob Lucci, the leader of
the current CP9, is considered

55
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,510
to be the strongest in the history of Cipher Pol.

56
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,640
To think that even he has
been defeated by a pirate...!

57
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,110
Luffy won!

58
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,860
Coo, coo, coo...

59
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,240
Coo, coo.

60
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,840
He had me worried there.

61
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,260
So you finally did it, Straw Hat!

62
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,930
Luffy!

63
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,390
Everyone! Get on the escape ship
right away! We're gonna set sail!

64
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,610
You did it! Luffy!

65
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,610
You did it, Straw Hat!

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,820
Hm?

67
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,030
Y-You morons! They can hear us!

68
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,940
That's okay! We'll let him know!

69
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,910
Hey! Who're those voices?!

70
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,710
We don't know! They're coming
from somewhere via transponder snail!

71
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,880
Bro!

72
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,270
What?! This voice...

73
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,220
Stop it! If we had just taken off,
we would've been considered dead!

74
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,650
You guys...

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,450
Those guys...

76
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,990
Are they possibly the pirates
we took out at the main gate?

77
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,790
Well, they can't be...
I'm sure they all fell off the cliff!

78
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,460
There's no way they could've survived.

79
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,170
Dammit! It's a cannon attack!

80
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,390
Bro!

81
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,890
Hey, idiot! Don't push!

82
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,980
Don't move!

83
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,360
--We're gonna fall!
--The ropes are gonna rip!

84
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,390
You morons! Galley-La's ropes never tear!

85
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,480
Seriously, after I told you
to keep your mouth shut...

86
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,960
We're all okay!

87
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,730
The giants took all the cannon fire for us!

88
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,490
Ribbit!

89
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,460
Whoa! They sure are tough.

90
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,160
Grandma! They're all alive!

91
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,060
Sodom and Gomorrah are okay, too!

92
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,460
I'm so glad to hear that!

93
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,650
Now, if we take our sweet time here,
the battleships will come again!

94
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,140
Let's hurry up and get out of here!

95
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,050
Anyway... we have a means to escape,
so don't worry about us!

96
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,690
We'll see you after we
make it out of here alive!

97
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,880
That's right!

98
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,930
Let's hurry!

99
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,140
You guys need to hurry up and climb already!

100
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,880
The blood is rushing up to my head!

101
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,150
Actually, it's rushing down!

102
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,420
Okay, climb up!

103
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,910
Climb up slowly!

104
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,170
We're gonna fall!

105
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,910
--Ribbit!
--Don't shake!

106
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,080
You guys...! Dummies...!

107
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,080
I wasn't worried about you guys! You dummies!

108
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,040
Those idiots are alive!
I'm glad...! I'm glad! I'm so happy!

109
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,750
Yeah. It's really a relief.

110
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,220
But there's no point if you die here, is there?

111
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,910
Yeah. You're right.

112
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,810
Should we head over to
the main gate right away?!

113
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,230
Do it later. Right now, we have
to focus our efforts here.

114
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,240
What're you all doing?!
Carry out your duty already!

115
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Yes, sir!

116
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,540
Hey! Bring on as many guys as you'd like!

117
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,170
Thunderbolt Tempo!

118
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,590
Tiger Trap!

119
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,840
Oni Giri!

120
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,300
Pound Phoenix!

121
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,060
Cien Fleurs!

122
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,270
Keep an eye on Straw Hat in the first column!

123
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,620
Y-Yes, sir, but...

124
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,360
Hm?

125
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,380
Pirate Straw Hat Luffy also
appears to be severely wounded!

126
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,750
He isn't moving at all!

127
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,370
What?!

128
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,730
Hey, Luffy!

129
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,760
What're you doing?! Hurry up
and get your butt over here!

130
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,610
We have to run or we won't survive!

131
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,820
What's the matter! We're almost there!

132
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,790
Use your Gum-Gum to shoot yourself over here!

133
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,080
Once you're here, I'll carry you!

134
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,580
We're surrounded by the sea
and a bunch of battleships!

135
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,970
If we stay here, we're gonna be killed!

136
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,000
It seems that the pirates are trying
to escape using the escort ship.

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,980
Yeah.

138
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,940
Luffy!

139
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,490
Luffy! Can you hear me, Luffy?!

140
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,350
I-I can't...

141
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,500
My body...

142
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,710
What?

143
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,630
...isn't moving at all.

144
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,810
It isn't moving...?

145
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,890
Don't be ridiculous! You defeated the enemy!

146
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,350
We got Robin back, too!
All that's left is for us to go back!

147
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,770
Please! Try hard!

148
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,530
Usopp!

149
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,670
Let's take the ship to
the column where Luffy is!

150
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,450
Everyone! Hurry up and get on the ship!

151
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,370
Fire!

152
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,970
No! Our escape ship is...!

153
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,950
Oh, crap...! Now it's hopeless...

154
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,570
Besides that ship, there's no other
way for us to escape from here!

155
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,030
Kokoro-san... Chimney... Gonbe... Chopper!

156
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,720
O-Oh, no...

157
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,530
I'm gonna die!

158
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,870
They're okay somehow!

159
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,620
Outta our way!

160
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,010
Good!

161
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,800
Sanji-kun! Where on earth have you been?!

162
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,900
Well, sorry about that.
I had to take care of something.

163
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,810
But at any rate, this is terrible.
We're in serious trouble!

164
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,590
Since we have Robin-chan,

165
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,530
I thought they weren't gonna
attack this area. But the ship was...

166
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,570
That's it, you bastards!
Release the old lady now and...

167
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,160
This is no time for that!

168
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Mermaid Kick!

169
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,000
Fire.

170
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,290
They're even firing on their own people!

171
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,100
Corner them at the second column!

172
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,310
Fire!

173
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,570
Watch out! Run! Run!

174
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,960
Fire!

175
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,950
Dammit! They've finally
taken out the entire bridge!

176
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,470
We're cornered on this column!

177
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,850
We're out of options!

178
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,330
We have no choice but to
fight them all from here!

179
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,240
Don't be stupid! There's gonna be
wave after wave of stronger guys!

180
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,360
Prepare all cannons to fire on the first column!

181
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,270
Eliminate Straw Hat Luffy immediately!

182
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,940
Luffy!

183
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,120
Luffy's in danger! We have
to at least bring him over!

184
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,460
Oh, crap...!

185
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,570
Luffy!

186
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,980
It won't work. Because of the distance,

187
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,800
even if I try to pull him,
I'll drop him into the sea.

188
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,760
Luffy!

189
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,160
This is bad. Things are in a terrible state!

190
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,200
Straw Hat won, but he can't stand up!
It seems like his life is in danger!

191
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,060
What?!

192
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,220
--Straw Hat!
--Straw Hat!

193
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,650
Ribbit! Ribbit!

194
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,650
Stand up, Straw Hat!

195
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,060
Get ahold of yourself, kid!

196
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,600
Pirate guy!

197
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,290
Luffy! Stand up! Please!

198
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,950
Isn't there something you can do, Luffy?!

199
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,310
Luffy!

200
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,460
Straw Hat!

201
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,850
Straw Hat! You can do it!

202
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,670
Straw Hat!

203
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,800
Ribbit, ribbit!

204
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,760
Oh, crap... I'm seriously in trouble...!

205
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,520
Luffy!

206
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,600
Do something, Luffy!

207
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,490
Straw Hat!

208
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,070
Get ahold of yourself, Straw Hat!

209
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,980
Straw Hat!

210
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,410
Again...!

211
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,870
Who is that?!

212
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,620
Hey! Do you wanna get killed?!
This is no time to be spacing out!

213
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,110
Just whose voice is this?

214
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,590
Th-That's right! This is the
same voice from that time...

215
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,500
What's going on?!

216
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,170
--Straw Hat!
--Straw Hat!

217
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,920
It's obvious! My underlings are...

218
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,050
No! Not those voices!
I've been hearing it for a while!

219
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,950
Huh?!

220
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,070
Below...?

221
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,670
Look below?

222
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,980
I'm not mistaken. I can hear it. What? Below?

223
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,360
Who's that?!

224
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,440
What the hell is this?

225
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,180
It's telling us to look below!

226
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,290
What're you talking about, reindeer?

227
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,360
In five seconds, fire at Straw Hat
Luffy in the first column!

228
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,000
--Luffy is gonna...!
--Straw Hat!

229
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,980
You're such a... Really, you're such a...

230
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,020
Jump into the sea!

231
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,150
Four seconds!

232
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,570
Into the sea!

233
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,360
Usopp?!

234
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,530
Robin! Can you drop Luffy into the sea?

235
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,580
--Leave it to me!
--You idiot! Are you trying
to get us to commit suicide?!

236
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,620
Getting desperate won't save us!

237
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,110
Three!

238
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,130
We're gonna be saved!
She came to rescue us!

239
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,010
We've got one more friend, right?!

240
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,970
Two!

241
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,620
Chopper! Did you look below?!

242
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,930
I did!

243
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,640
Cien Fleurs!

244
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,360
One!

245
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,020
Delphinium!

246
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm moving! Is Robin doing this?!

247
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,040
Into the sea!

248
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,960
Into the sea...!

249
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Into the sea!

250
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,210
Follow Luffy!

251
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,510
Here we go!

252
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,140
Here we go...!

253
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,970
Into the sea!

254
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,020
The pirates are jumping into the sea!

255
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,690
How stupid! There's no way that they
can survive after jumping into this sea.

256
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,060
Did the pirates lose their minds?!

257
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,980
Let's go back, everyone!

258
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,300
Fire!

259
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,640
Back to the seas of adventure!

260
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,610
Get on the Merry!

261
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,740
Merry!

262
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,210
I came to get you!

263
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,380
I have been alone all this time.

264
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,760
To think that what Saul said came true...

265
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,930
Friends...

266
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,230
I appreciate them for rescuing me
from the bottom of my heart.

267
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

268
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,940
"Everyone Makes a Great Escape!
The Road to Victory Is for the Pirates"

269
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
