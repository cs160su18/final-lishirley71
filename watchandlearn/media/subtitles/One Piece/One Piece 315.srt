00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,930
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,740
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,290
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,450
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,390
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,120
Your father's name is...

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,520
...Monkey D. Dragon. He's a revolutionary!

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,480
What?!

37
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,940
Hey, guys... What are you so surprised about?

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,790
There's a power trying to bring down
the World Government directly now.

39
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,110
That's the revolutionary army.

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,950
And Dragon is the man who leads it.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,930
Ah! I guess...

42
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,000
...I shouldn't have said anything about it, huh?

43
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,800
Well, then...

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,630
...forget what I just said!

45
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,140
Whaaat?!

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,900
Since you're my grandson, I decided
not to capture you on this island!

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,110
I'm gonna give the Navy that good excuse,
so stay here and rest easy!

48
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,110
That can't be an excuse,
so let's tell them that he got away.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,200
I just came along with these two.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,070
Well, take your time and talk with them.

51
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,490
I'm going back!

52
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,660
Okay! See ya!

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,370
That's too casual!

54
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,830
Be more reluctant to say goodbye, you idiot!

55
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,940
You haven't seen your grandpa in forever!

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,490
What do you want me to do?!
All you did was hit me!

57
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,260
Even so, I still want my grandson
to love me, you moron!

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,840
Ah...

59
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,900
That selfishness... You can
really tell that they're related.

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,230
Yeah.

61
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,950
"Its Name Is the New World!
The Fate of the Grand Line!"

62
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,460
Anyway, that old man was like a storm.

63
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,620
I was really surprised about Dragon.

64
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,300
So he was special to begin
with because of his lineage.

65
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,280
Where's Luffy?

66
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,880
He's out front talking to Coby and his buddy.

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,380
Don't you have to go?
They're your friends, too, right?

68
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,760
It does bring back memories...

69
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,380
...but it was Luffy who saved Coby.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,800
Nami isn't around either, huh?

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,320
I thought she wanted to hear
stories about the marines...

72
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,780
I wonder if she decided to let them talk alone...

73
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,330
She went to the pool with
Kokoro-san and the others.

74
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,600
Pool?

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,650
Yeah, to the Galley-La Company's
employee pool that's behind here.

76
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,880
What?! Nami-san's wearing a bathing suit?!

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,240
I'll go bring drinks or something!

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,270
Then, you guys also crossed
that mountain, huh?

79
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,750
That mountain? Oh, no,
we didn't cross Reverse Mountain.

80
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,420
Hm? But I saw in a newspaper before

81
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,230
that my grandpa's ship
crossed that mystery mountain

82
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,100
and entered the Grand Line.

83
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, that article was a lie.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,870
Hey, Coby! You shouldn't
tell him about it so casually!

85
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,510
Ah...

86
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,560
But it's okay, since it's Luffy-san.

87
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,440
H-How could it be okay?!
He is a pirate, you know!

88
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,860
Don't worry.

89
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,640
Hmm... Don't just talk to each other.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,340
Ah... Let's see... This is top secret,

91
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,070
but headquarters' battleships can
get through the Calm Belt, so...

92
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,650
What?! That's not fair!

93
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,120
Of course, it's not 100% reliable, though.

94
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,340
But how come?

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,080
There's a swarm of Sea Kings several
times larger than battleships there.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,260
We had a terrible time there!

97
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,390
To tell you the truth,
at the bottom of the battleships,

98
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,440
they spread these stones
called Sea Prism Stones.

99
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,800
What about it?

100
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,070
Ah... That is to say...

101
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,700
...that Sea Prism Stones release
the same energy as the sea itself,

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,440
so to the fish in the sea, those ships are...

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,340
The sea's energy...!

104
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,550
Oh, I see! So even when those
ships pass by on the sea's surface,

105
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,910
the Sea Kings wouldn't notice them.

106
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,390
In that case, they don't have
to go through the trouble

107
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,530
of passing through Reverse Mountain,
the entrance to the Grand Line.

108
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,710
They can just enter as they please.

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,400
The Navy's scientists are pretty impressive.

110
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,070
I got some good info.

111
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,900
Lady! Lady! Aren't you gonna swim?!

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,250
Hey!

113
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,890
Hey, be quiet, Chimney!
Chances like this don't come often!

114
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,190
Pirate lady! This is boring! This is boring!

115
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,330
Quiet! I'm eavesdropping right now!

116
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,360
Is that something you want
to broadcast out loud?

117
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,720
Dig into these epoch-making technologies,

118
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,730
and you'll always find Dr. Vegapunk,
a Navy scientist. He's incredible!

119
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,350
Yeah, he's really incredible!

120
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,300
For example, Straw Hat,
take Devil Fruits, like the one you ate.

121
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,360
He's already clarified how
their powers get transmitted.

122
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,880
In addition, another one of his big
achievements over the past few years

123
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,940
is creating new tech that allows
an object to eat a Devil Fruit.

124
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,810
Dr. Vegapunk...

125
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,640
I see... There are some
amazing guys out there, huh?

126
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,940
Yes, the world is full of incredible people!

127
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:50,650
I realized what a small world
I lived in before I met you.

128
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,490
If you hadn't come out of that
barrel that day, Luffy-san...

129
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,420
...I bet I would still be buttering up
Alvida and doing chores for her.

130
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,940
That's right, you were on Alvida's ship!
That was really funny!

131
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,300
To start with, the reason
you were on her ship was...

132
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,430
What is it? I don't know anything about that.

133
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,560
Err... Well... Um...

134
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,010
You wanted to go fishing and got
on a pirate ship by mistake, right?

135
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,890
What the hell?! What a bungler!

136
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,520
Back then, I was such a coward
that I couldn't even run away.

137
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,870
But because I was on that ship,
I was able to meet you, Luffy-san.

138
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,540
So it wasn't a mistake after all!

139
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,770
I was doing chores on that ship
in order to meet you, I bet!

140
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,460
Is that how it is?

141
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,470
That's how it is, yep!

142
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,430
You've kinda become strong.

143
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,230
I'm being trained every day, so...

144
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,780
Seriously, your grandpa doesn't
know how to go easy on others.

145
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,190
Yeah, I know what you mean.

146
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,640
No, Vice Admiral Garp is a wonderful man!

147
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,420
He took us in when we had
nowhere to go due to an incident.

148
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,830
We can train in Navy Headquarters right
now all thanks to Vice Admiral Garp.

149
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,330
Yeah, his grueling training sure is tough...

150
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,520
It's tough... but I really appreciate him.

151
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,150
So, I'll at least become able to
return the favor first, and then...

152
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,070
No! I'm gonna get promoted
high enough to boss him around!

153
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,010
Whoa! Cool, split chin!

154
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,240
What'd you say?! It's not split!

155
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,740
I still can't get used to...

156
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,930
...Kokoro-san looking like that...

157
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,660
Pirate lady! Let's play volleyball!

158
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,690
What?! Are you really going back already?

159
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,110
Why don't you have dinner with us? Dinner!

160
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,820
Properly speaking, we're enemies.

161
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,010
We can't become close, so...

162
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,250
Luffy-san, do you know what the
second half of the Grand Line is called?

163
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,500
People call the last sea that
lies beyond the Red Line

164
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,430
by another name...

165
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,070
The New World.

166
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,380
The New World...

167
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,440
It's a sea where those who will open
the way to the next era gather.

168
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,290
The one who comes to conquer this sea
will indeed be the King of the Pirates.

169
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,070
Yep.

170
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,840
Luffy-san! Let's meet again there for sure!

171
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,020
Next time I see you, I'll capture you!

172
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,050
I'll get stronger and stronger,

173
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,870
and one day... I'll become a...

174
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,740
...N...

175
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,980
Navy Admiral!

176
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,320
Whoa... Ah... Um...

177
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,840
I-I-I'm sorry! I-I got too full of myself!

178
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,700
I'm so embarrassed! I wanna crawl under a rug!

179
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,100
I-I got carried away, since I saw you, and...

180
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,830
Coby...

181
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,000
You're gonna fight me, right?

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,790
Then at least get to that level.
It's obvious you'll need to.

183
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,260
I-It's an Admiral we're talking about...

184
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,210
Next time we meet, we'll be stronger!

185
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,390
More amazing!

186
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,350
Why...

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,390
As I am right now, it's such a wild dream

188
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,900
that just saying it almost makes me faint...

189
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,330
And yet, how can you
have faith in me like that?

190
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,210
Oh? You're still a crybaby, huh, Coby?

191
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,970
I'm so glad that I was able
to see you two again today!

192
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,110
It really is a lot of work
chasing after these people.

193
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,140
We'll get stronger and stronger!

194
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,430
Let's meet again in the New World for sure!

195
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,640
--Let's go!
--Ah, hey!

196
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,450
You guys'd better be prepared!
We'll blow you away in time!

197
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,210
Hey, wait up, you jerk!

198
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,390
All right! Let's see who
makes it to the harbor first!

199
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,920
Don't be silly! That's not fair!

200
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:48,890
Luffy... didn't you just
create another crazy enemy?

201
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,520
Coby is a man who makes
things happen. I know that much.

202
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,100
It was good to see that
he seemed to be doing well.

203
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:28,220
But I wonder if he realizes how the world
sees what happened in Enies Lobby...

204
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,100
In any event, an island directly under
the Government was annihilated...

205
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,660
...although I guess the news that they brought
down CP9 probably won't be made public.

206
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,810
Of course, it can't be made public,
since CP9 is a secret organization.

207
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,240
The truth is, Enies Lobby caught fire
due to the Buster Call in the first place,

208
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,820
and yet they claimed that Luffy-san
and the others did all of that.

209
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,370
With the entire military force
of Enies Lobby at our disposal...

210
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,170
With the power of Buster Call,
as strong as an entire country's military...

211
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,510
Why... Why in the hell can't we...

212
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,340
Why...? Why can't we take a single woman...

213
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,740
...from a puny little band of pirates?!

214
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,560
The Navy should be protecting Justice...
There's no way this is right.

215
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,940
So you just need to become a
big shot and change it, right?

216
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,400
Yeah, you're right.

217
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,260
Seriously, to think that he picked
a fight with the Government

218
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,590
in order to get just one crewmate back...

219
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,850
Just how stupid is he?

220
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,400
So you're worried about Luffy-san, too, huh?!

221
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,930
No, it's not like that!
I have nothing to do with him.

222
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,770
I'm just looking on from a distance.

223
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,340
Hey! What're you two doing slacking off?!

224
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
--Ahhh!
--He's here!

225
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,810
It's 1,000 years too early for you to fool
around in a place like this, you idiots!

226
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,200
No meals for either of you for a week!

227
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,960
Y-Yes, sir!

228
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,400
Nami-san! Water-water meat barbecue is ready!

229
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,810
Okay!

230
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,390
Grandma, that was amazing!

231
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,160
It smells good.

232
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,750
Right?!

233
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,110
Here, say "Ahh."

234
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,010
Ugh!

235
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,490
Yummy!

236
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,910
Yummy! Water-water meat barbecue!

237
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,060
Sogeking! When'd you get here?!

238
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,750
Okay, guys, keep eating!

239
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,480
Why are you crying?

240
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,490
Shut up! The smoke is hurting my eyes!

241
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,170
So how is it, Robin-chan?! You can
tell it was marinated well, right?!

242
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,700
Yeah, it's delicious.

243
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,990
Oh, there they are!

244
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,700
Straw Hat! We heard that you woke up!

245
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,120
Oh, Franky Family! Come here and eat!

246
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,410
Whoa! They're having barbecue!

247
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,000
My favorite!

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,820
Whoa! There are so many of you!

249
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,680
Hey, add more meat!

250
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,630
Ah! Sodom and Gomorrah!

251
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,270
I'm hungry.

252
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,350
Me, too.

253
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,060
Giants! Hey!

254
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,480
Hey, Straw Hat! You woke up?!

255
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,560
Oh, Galley-La is here, too, huh?!

256
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,960
What're you guys doing around the pool?

257
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,210
Ahh! Shameless girl! What're you...?!

258
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,820
This is a pool, mister.

259
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,440
Well... something smells good.

260
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,350
Iceberg-san! No! You shouldn't
see this! This woman is a perv!

261
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,450
Hey...

262
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,290
We're taking a break from building a ship!

263
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,170
That's right! Rejecting a party
would make me less of a man!

264
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,750
You'd better have a seat for me!

265
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,960
You'd better!

266
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,920
Yow!

267
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,800
We've been waiting for you, Bro!

268
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:07,260
Here we go! Entrant #1, Sogeking! I'll sing!

269
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,520

Stay there and listen, Nico Robin.

285
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,030
It can't be...

286
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,010
Aokiji...?

287
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,080
Why didn't you run as usual?

288
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm sure you could've escaped
from CP9 alone if you'd wanted to.

289
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,410
I told you that it's different now.

290
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,890
I couldn't just stand by... and let them die.

291
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,270
Jaguar D. Saul, the giant who
fought for Ohara 20 years ago,

292
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,820
was a close friend of mine.

293
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,360
Kuzan!

294
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,360
Can you take pride in this attack?

295
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,410
Can you still keep your head high?!

296
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,710
On that day, I let you escape
the island according to his wish.

297
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,530
So I'm obligated to watch
the rest of your life to the end.

298
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,060
But after 20 years, you seemed
to have no tree to call home.

299
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,060
I judged that I could no longer
ignore a dangerous bomb

300
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,140
that bounced around as it was chased.

301
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,980
Above all things, I thought
that you wanted to die.

302
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,240
With this whole thing, I was going
to settle everything regarding Ohara.

303
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,950
As a matter of course, I couldn't predict
that CP9 would be defeated at all.

304
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,800
So you finally found a tree to call home?

305
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,810
Yes...

306
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,260
Whether Saul letting you
live was right or wrong...

307
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,320
Will you show me the answer from here on?

308
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,140
That's what I intend to do.

309
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,710
Then, live strongly.

310
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,210
Ohara still lives on.

311
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,180
Aokiji!

312
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,170
Hey! Robin! Look at this!

313
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,830
Robin! Look at this!

314
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,700
Robin!

315
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,110
Are you eating meat?!

316
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,340
That's so cool, Luffy!

317
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,360
You're doing that stupid
stuff again?! Cut it out!

318
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,270
You too! You're wearing a shirt over
a bathing suit! That looks stupid!

319
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,150
--Are you tryin' to be Franky?!
--Don't say that!

320
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,520
Hey, that way!

321
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,570
I heard that the pirates are having a party!

322
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,140
You finally found a tree to call home?

323
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,960
No one is born into this world to be alone!

324
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,920
Yeah, you're right, Saul.

325
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,100
Live together with them.

326
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,430
Yes...

327
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,520
Hey! Robin!

328
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,150
Hey! This way! This way!

329
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,860
Maybe... I'll try it, too.

330
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,020
Yeah! Do it! Do it, Robin!

331
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,860
Please don't do it, Robin-chan!

332
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,040
Whoa! You don't have to go that far...

333
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,010
Pardon me, but since I'm on an enemy ship,
I used a bit of intimidation.

334
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,210
There's something I want to discuss with you.

335
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,890
Whitebeard...

336
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,730
Please stop Ace, your second
division commander.

337
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,240
On the next episode of One Piece!

338
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,070
"Shanks Makes a Move!
The Linchpin to the Reckless Era!"

339
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,570
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
