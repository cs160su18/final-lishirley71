00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome treasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King of
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone dreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen through
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny is
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve your
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

17
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,320
How's it look?! Have we lost them?!

18
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,190
Looks like they've given
up. I can't see them.

19
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,700
Really? Good!

20
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,160
Anyway, that monstrous cannon sure scared me!

21
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,570
Where the heck were they hiding that thing?!

22
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,700
A cannon?!

23
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,490
Yeah, you know, that huge thing that
the warriors were carrying.

24
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,410
Oh, that...

25
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,370
"Oh, that"?! Hey, it's no
laughing matter! It was really scary!

26
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,220
He's right! Don't laugh!

27
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,000
Ah! There they are! It's Nami and Conis!

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,540
What?! Nami-san!! Conis-chan!!

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,230
Ow!

30
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,720
Are you all right?!

31
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,600
Of course!!

32
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,480
"Off to the Blue Sea!!
Finale Woven by Feelings"

33
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,910
What? They rushed off of the island?

34
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes. We couldn't even give them our gift.

35
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,660
How disappointing...

36
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,170
I wonder if they even realize how much
we appreciate what they did.

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,100
Exactly. They have no idea how I feel.

38
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,860
It's not fair, Aisa... that you
alone got to say goodbye to them.

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,670
Everyone's in an uproar that we
let our saviors run away.

40
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,660
But Luffy and the others told
me not to tell anyone.

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,260
Did you say anything to them?

42
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,120
Yeah! I said, "Thank you."

43
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,960
Hey Laki, did you know?Luffy's
body stretches!

44
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,260
He'd be like, "Gum-Gum Pistol!!"

45
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,450
Hey, Aisa, don't move!

46
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,640
I didn't know there was a strong warrior
like him in the Blue Sea, too.

47
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,000
I wanna be like him, like "Gum-Gum...!"

48
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,990
Aisa...

49
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,320
Let's just trim your hair for
today. Let your hair grow.

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,160
What?

51
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,820
I'm sure it'll look good on you.You're
a girl, so you should look cute.

52
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,460
Cute?! Me?!

53
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,870
That's right... since there won't be any
need for you kids to carry arms...

54
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,330
...and since you can now live
freely,like people in the sky should.

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,580
You're ladylike today.

56
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,220
Now, don't move, Aisa!

57
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,080
Ladylike Laki!

58
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,180
Aisa!

59
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,330
Great Warrior Calgara...

60
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,400
We were told that the Shandians' role
had been fulfilled.

61
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,990
And I'm sure your wish was delivered to
your best friend as well.

62
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,410
We no longer have to make future
generations shed blood.

63
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,250
The battle is over...but
we won't lose our pride!

64
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,210
So please continue to watch over us.

65
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,570
We swear that we will not let the fire
of Shandora go out ever again!

66
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,880
I am the Sky Knight,a
freelance soldier-for-hire.

67
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,090
This land won't need such a thing anymore.

68
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,540
What this land needs now is
someone to govern it.

69
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,380
I'm saying that I'd like
you to be that person.

70
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:19,850
You're the best suited for it. This
city belonged to your people from the start.

71
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,010
What's this all of a sudden?That's
not a good reason.

72
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,950
With this battle, I think everyone
must have realized...

73
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,660
...that no one can own Vearth.

74
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,780
"God" is our support.

75
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,010
The name of the land is Skypiea.The
name of the city is Shandora.

76
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,740
The only person who can unify them is you,

77
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:46,250
who continued to be anguished by
the battle in this land.

78
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,910
Sky Knight Gan Fall... I would like you
to take the seat of God again,

79
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,710
and support this land
whose scar is still deep.

80
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,820
We'd like you to, as well!

81
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,760
Gan Fall-sama!

82
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,120
If it's you, we'll accept it, too!

83
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,930
Yeah!

84
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,250
Gan Fall!

85
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,260
God!

86
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,840
Please come back!

87
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,010
Honestly...

88
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,770
Just when I thought I could finally really
enjoy growing pumpkins...

89
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,760
Everyone! We can see it now!

90
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,270
Please look to the front! It's Cloud End!

91
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,440
Ah! Let's see!

92
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,870
I see... So we can go back down from there?

93
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,800
We got here sooner than I thought.

94
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,870
So we're going back down, huh?

95
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,540
Yeah, now that we're about to go
back, I admit I hate to leave.

96
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,480
It's time to say goodbye to
this pure white sea.

97
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,590
The sky island was fun...
though it was scary.

98
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,350
So once we go through that gate,we'll
be heading straight down

99
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,530
to the Blue Sea via a Milky Road, huh?

100
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,090
I wonder if we can visit
the sky island again...

101
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,820
Hard to tell with this place.

102
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,040
Well then, everyone! I'm
sorry!We'll say goodbye here!

103
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,840
Please take care, everyone!

104
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,710
Thanks for seeing us off!

105
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,520
Conis-chan! Take care of yourself!

106
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,210
Say hello to the others!

107
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,730
See you!!

108
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,100
Thanks for everything!

109
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,010
No, we should be thanking you!

110
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,850
I'll never forget you all!

111
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,190
Conis, old guy and little white
one! You all take care!!

112
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,400
Yes!

113
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,390
Now, furl the sails immediately and
hold on tight to the ship!

114
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,690
Alright! Do as the old guy said!Sounds
like it's gonna go pretty fast!

115
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,650
Yeah, we're sliding from
a 7,000-meter height! Hurry up!!

116
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,610
Okay!

117
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,870
Wh-What?! What?!

118
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,930
He says, "Don't forget about me."

119
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,770
Oh... That's the South Bird we
brought to the sky with us.

120
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,020
Now, Captain! We got the
log for the next island!

121
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,730
Yeah! Once we get off from here,we'll
start on a new adventure again!

122
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,940
Guys! You ready?!

123
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,310
We're gonna go back to the Blue Sea!

124
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,620
Yeah!!

125
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,270
Everyone! Be careful while dropping!

126
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,410
While dropping?

127
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,610
Heso!

128
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,940
Here we go! The sky island's famous
Octopus Balloon!

129
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,290
It's an octopus!!

130
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,680
You son of a...!

131
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,390
Ow-ow...

132
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,350
Wh-What?! What the...?!

133
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,020
Hey, look! This is so cool!!

134
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,800
What the hell is this?!

135
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,150
It's a balloon!

136
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,700
This is fun!

137
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,920
We've slowed down!

138
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,040
I... I thought that I was finally gonna
go to the netherworld.

139
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:08,290
Ring it! See off the saviors
of this land by ringing the bell!

140
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,040
Heso!

141
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,170
Luffy! See you again!!

142
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,990
Come visit us again!!

143
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,860
Thank you!!

144
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,470
Go back to the Blue Sea safely!!

145
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,750
When you look up, you see the sky.

146
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,770
Is this God's Land on the clouds
a dream or reality?

147
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,570
10,000 meters far up in the sky...

148
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,690
If you listen carefully, you
can hear the sound of the bell.

149
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,160
It rings today, and it
will ring again tomorrow.

150
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,230
The sound of the bell that echoes in the sky

151
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,820
glorifies and sings about
the wandering land...

152
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,580
This is cool!

153
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,560
Yeah! This feels so good!

154
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,620
You're calling off the search?!

155
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,610
It's just natural, right?!The
city of gold was in the sky.

156
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,450
We won't find anything at
the bottom of the sea.

157
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,560
This is the end.

158
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,120
There's no point in staying here.

159
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,260
Old-timer...

160
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,800
Old-timer...

161
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:50,530
I really thank you all... for joining me
to pursue my dream for years.

162
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,740
What're you saying...?

163
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,300
Don't treat us like strangers...

164
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,520
Say, you guys!

165
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
What kind of romanticism shall
we go after next?!

166
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,020
"Noland the Liar"

167
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,740
We'll follow you to the ends of
the earth, old-timer!!

168
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,450
Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold!

169
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,000
We've finally become super
rich!!What shall we buy?!

170
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,910
How about buying a huge bronze statue?!

171
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,210
You moron! What's the point
of exchanging gold with bronze?!

172
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,930
We should increase the number of cannons!
Let's buy ten of them! Ten!

173
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,080
Nami-san! I want a lockable refrigerator!

174
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,670
Don't be stupid! What're we gonna do
when we get hungry?! I object!

175
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,070
I... I... I want you to buy me some books!

176
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,940
I want to read medical books
from other countries!!

177
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,670
That's just why we should
buy it, you dumb ass!

178
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,690
Hey, hold on a second, you guys!

179
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,690
We'll split the treasure
once we get back down, okay?

180
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,500
Please buy books for me!

181
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,110
If we buy whatever you guys like, I have a
feeling that it won't do us any good.

182
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,320
Navigator...

183
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,440
I wonder where this ship is heading.

184
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,040
Where? The next island...

185
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,100
What?! What?!

186
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,930
What's the matter?

187
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,430
What's the matter, Nami-san?

188
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,290
Darn! We started riding an air current at
some point and now we're drifting!

189
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,800
Air current?!

190
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,890
Come to think of it, there is a wind...

191
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,330
Is that a problem?

192
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,120
Of course it is! As it stands, we
don't know where on the sea we'll land!

193
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,990
What're we gonna do? In this state,I
can't set the sails and control the ship.

194
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,250
Well, don't worry. We'll just head back to
the next island once we reach the sea.

195
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,360
You just blurt things out
casually, as always...

196
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,130
But...

197
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,990
What is it, Sanji-kun?

198
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,800
Well... I guess it was my imagination.

199
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Hm? What're you talking about?

200
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,280
No, nothing...

201
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,890
There's a problem! Hey!

202
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,280
Oh, it was just a dream.

203
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,120
What's with you?!

204
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,890
I'm gonna cut you into
fillets,you damn Moss Head!

205
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,240
You scared me!

206
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,160
Now, now, Zoro's tired, too,after
the battle in the sky, so...

207
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,430
The sun's completely set now.

208
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,870
But it's a nice view.

209
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,660
Yeah, you're right.

210
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,880
Hm? Is it morning?

211
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,010
I just said that the sun set!

212
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,530
It's taking quite a long
time to get to the Blue Sea.

213
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm so worried about how
far the ship will drift.

214
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,990
Then shall I sing a love song
or something to take your mind off it?

215
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,850
Shut up!

216
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,800
It'd be quick and easy if we drifted
to Raftel, wouldn't it?

217
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
Usopp! That'd be cool!

218
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,010
That's not possible.

219
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,260
To get to Raftel, we still have to go
more than halfway around the Grand Line.

220
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,450
Uh, well, yeah... I know that.

221
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,080
In any case, I'm so bored.

222
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,720
When are we gonna reach the sea?

223
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,910
Oh, just go to sleep.

224
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,380
If you're bored, come
here,too, Zoro! This is fun!

225
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,350
Oh? Luffy?

226
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,840
Where did his voice come from?

227
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,980
It sounded sorta far off.

228
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,960
Luffy! Where are you?!

229
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,050
I'm over here! Everyone, come up here, too!!

230
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,930
This is fun!!

231
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,060
Ugh! So he is up there!

232
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,020
Awesome! This is awesome!!

233
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,860
Hey! Don't be reckless!Our
lives depend on that balloon!!

234
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,270
Don't worry! Don't worry!

235
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,790
No, Luffy! Come back down!

236
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,880
Hey Luffy, stop it!

237
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,950
What's the matter all of a sudden, Sanji-kun?

238
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,440
This octopus is shrinking!If we
don't do anything, we'll fall!

239
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,430
What?!

240
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,190
Hey, Luffy!

241
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,170
What's going on?

242
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,060
He said this octopus is shrinking!

243
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,730
What?!

244
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,320
Now that you mention it,it
looks smaller than before.

245
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,230
What're we gonna do?!We're
still pretty high up!

246
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,950
I wonder if it'll last
until we reach the sea...

247
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,980
Hey Luffy! Something is
strange,so come back down!!

248
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,670
That was quite a scare, since it
stopped bouncing suddenly.

249
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,240
Like I said, the octopus is shrinking!

250
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,890
O-Oh? I didn't do anything,but
we came back to the ship!

251
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,570
Ahhh! We're falling! We're falling!!

252
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,440
This is bad! At this rate,we'll
be swallowed by the sea!

253
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,330
There's no guarantee that
we'll fall into the sea!

254
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,150
Ugh! That's right! Dammit!

255
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,340
What're you doing, Usopp?!

256
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,500
What else?! Protecting the ship!

257
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,980
What're you gonna do?!

258
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,500
Don't be reckless, Usopp!

259
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,140
Usopp Aa-aa-aa!

260
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,240
Okay, it worked!

261
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,560
Alright!

262
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,570
I'm gonna use all the Breath Dials I have...

263
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,790
There! Float!!

264
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,600
It's slowed down.

265
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,460
Sweet!

266
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,370
Were we saved?

267
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,880
Looks like it.

268
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,630
Did you see my wonderful work?!

269
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,210
Usopp, you're so cool!

270
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,470
I wondered what was gonna happen
for a moment there!

271
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,470
Yeah, seriously, I thought that was it.

272
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,070
Why?!

273
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,180
Usopp!!

274
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,520
Everyone, grab onto something and hold tight!

275
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,380
It's cold...!

276
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,160
Nami-san! Robin-chan! Are you okay?

277
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,390
That startled me! The octopus suddenly
shrunk all the way!

278
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,260
I wonder if the air leaked out.

279
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,850
What the heck happened?!

280
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,690
But we somehow made it down... without dying.

281
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,410
You! Thanks!

282
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,860
Still...

283
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,730
...we really went to an incredible
place, didn't we?

284
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,740
Now that we've fallen, it's so far up.

285
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,470
It's as if we were dreaming.

286
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,330
It's a dream land. I wonder if we
can go visit again some day.

287
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,000
You might be able to get closer if you die.

288
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,210
Zoro, so you think you can go to heaven?

289
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,850
You jerk!

290
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,250
Well, things're calm now at any
rate.I'll make coffee or something.

291
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,360
I'd rather have dinner, Sanji!

292
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm saying I'll get on it right
away,so have some coffee and wait!

293
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,520
Okay...

294
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,900
By the way...

295
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,870
Where the heck... are we?!

296
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,620
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

297
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,830
You gaze at the heavens as you wander about

298
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:27,450
Just like the moon,you
keep your gaze constant

299
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:39,830
And your deep reflection
wanes as you slowly disappear

300
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:53,360
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

301
00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:07,080
Dream, you travelers who
spend countless nights drifting

302
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,610
Even if you may not be able to go back

303
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:17,960
you will surely start moving forward again

304
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,310
Ugh! Where are we?!

305
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,930
What are these spotlights?!

306
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,040
A stage?! Is it my one-man show?!

307
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,850
Idiot!

308
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,760
This is the siren for a state
of emergency! Could this place be...?!

309
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,200
If that's the case, it looks like
we've fallen to a damn troublesome place!

310
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,510
Looks like we'd better first
get away from the ship.

311
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,590
What?! What about dinner?!

312
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,200
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,760
"A State of Emergency Is Issued!A
Notorious Pirate Ship Has Infiltrated!"

314
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
