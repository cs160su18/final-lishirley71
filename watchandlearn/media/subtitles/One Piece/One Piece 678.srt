The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Freedom is our only compass,
We are best friends

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920

Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,940
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,960
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,640
and have come to Dressrosa

76
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,580
but Law has been captured by Doflamingo.

77
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,160
Luffy snuck into the Royal Palace
to take back Law.

78
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,170
Sugar has passed out!!

79
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,870
What?!

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,650
The servants that we've been
collecting for a decade

81
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,370
are turning back into humans!

82
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,570
The spell of the Hobby-Hobby Fruit is
being removed!

83
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,970
We accomplished Operation SOP!

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,470
Who is he?!

85
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,440
Brother Kyros!

86
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,010
The toys were originally humans

87
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,770
but they were erased from our memories!

88
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,960
Since the Devil Fruit eater Sugar
passed out now,

89
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,860
we got our memories back!

90
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,140
He's the former commander of
the King Riku Army - Kyros!

91
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,860
You are...!

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,480
You're Kyros, aren't you?!

93
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,280
Yes, sir!

94
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
for a decade!

95
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,770
Now, I'm here to save you!

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,440
I'm here to take back the real Dressrosa!

97
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,110
"The Fire Fist Strikes!
The Flare-Flare Fruit Power Returns!"

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,970
A decade!

99
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,060
For a decade, we have suffered!

100
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,730
Doflamingo-sama!

101
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,560
Young Master!

102
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,390
You bastard!

103
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,860
From now on,
I'm gonna rip the mask off of all your deceptions!

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,780
Mingo's dead!

105
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,130
I was gonna kick his ass...

106
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,670
--There they are!
--I see them!

107
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,080
--You bastards!
--They found us!

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,000
Shoot!

109
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go rescue Tra-guy!

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,030
What?!

111
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,210
What in the world is going on?!

112
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,030
The toys in the Colosseum turned into
humans and animals all of a sudden!

113
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,200
Even I don't know how to
explain this situation...

114
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,130
Why is a gorilla here?!

115
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,700
Run!

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,820
I can't believe it!

117
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,070
Damn Trebol! He must've left Sugar unguarded!

118
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,090
That idiot!

119
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,490
How surprising!

120
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,880
Hey! How much longer are you gonna cry?!

121
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,570
Am I a babysitter?!

122
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,840
It's not that!

123
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,250
I just remember!

124
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,960
Mother-sama, I picked so many flowers!

125
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,710
Wow, Rebecca!

126
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,400
Would you like to have one?

127
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,240
Thank you. I would like to.

128
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,550
And this is from your mother to you!

129
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,990
Would you like to have one?

130
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,340
Let's eat!

131
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,540
Go ahead. Dig in.

132
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,990
Someone that I loved so much!

133
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,300
I'm gonna go to the palace!
Alright, Scarlet? Rebecca?

134
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,620
Father-sama!

135
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,340
If it gets dangerous here,
go to the Red Flower Field and wait there!

136
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,290
I'll come and get you at any cost!

137
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,190
Father-sama!

138
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,870
Father-sama!!

139
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,330
F-Father-sama!

140
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,940
What?

141
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,070
I...

142
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,780
...had a father!

143
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,520
Huh? What are you talking about?!

144
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,920
I guess that's the plot that's been
undermining the country, Rebecca.

145
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,860
Things always have a core.

146
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,270
And if you can strike it,
you can turn any situation around.

147
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,090
My great senpai!

148
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,540
Now I don't know what you are talking about!

149
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,460
Even the ring has one.

150
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,110
A core.

151
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,500
Let's just finish up this fight.

152
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,880
What the...

153
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,610
There are cracks in the ring!
Did Lucy do something?!

154
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,880
Dragon Claw Fist!

155
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,950
Dragon...

156
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,520
...Breath!

157
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:24,470
Whoa! Lucy's unbelievable attack!
The ring is sinking!

158
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,570
The ring has exploded!

159
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,260
What?

160
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,360
It's floating!

161
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,900
You bastard! What did you do?!

162
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,420
I gotta go somewhere! I'm gonna win this!

163
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,880
--Ring, ring, ring... Clank.
--Oh!

164
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,140
I heard a huge noise up there!

165
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,040
Hack?

166
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,930
Did he do something reckless again?!

167
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,660
He's gonna head underground now.

168
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,040
The ring has totally collapsed!

169
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,370
It seems like the water level is falling!

170
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,610
We can no longer guarantee
the safety of the Colosseum!

171
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,830
Everybody, please evacuate immediately!

172
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,100
It's driving to the center!

173
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,020
There must be some cracks in
the foundation of the ring!

174
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,760
The water is flowing down into the ground!

175
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,950
Give up, give up, give up!
You can't hold on to my neck! I'm choking!

176
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,540
This is nothing!

177
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,060
It's spirit! All about spirit!

178
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,030
That's...

179
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,620
I found it!

180
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,760
That son of a bitch!

181
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,500
I won't let you have it!

182
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,020
I got wet!

183
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm losing my strength...

184
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,460
Don't!

185
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,010
We weren't gonna give anyone that prize!

186
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,470
Everybody's out of the ring!
I'm the winner!

187
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,580
What?!

188
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,460
You said the one who gets
this will be the winner!

189
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,760
The Flare-Flare Fruit!

190
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,080
It's all mine, isn't it?

191
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,580
Th...

192
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,250
The champion! The champion!

193
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,540
I know now isn't the time

194
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,820
but the one who got
the Flare-Flare Fruit

195
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,490
by taking advantage of this mess is...

196
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,830
...the biggest dark horse of
this competition - Lucy!

197
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,400
He is the champion!!

198
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,560
Disgusting!

199
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,760
I can't hold out... anymore...

200
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,760
Oh my great senpai! Help me, too!

201
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,260
You're a man.
You have to take care of yourself!

202
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,700
What?!

203
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,470
But I knew that's what you would say...

204
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,810
--I'm gonna make one more attack so watch out!
--What?!

205
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,060
Damn! He ate the Flare-Flare Fruit!

206
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,740
Isn't he the guy
from the Revolutionary Army?!

207
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,530
Ow, it's hot!
I really can generate a fire!

208
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,970
His clothes! I forgot I have them!

209
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,800
No, it's just my imagination!
It's not hot!

210
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,940
I am a fire now!

211
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,840
Ace!

212
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,110
I take over your ability!

213
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,470
Ace!

214
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,540
I take over your ability!

215
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,170
You are...

216
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,460
Fire Fist!

217
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,750
THE UNDERGROUND TRADE PORT

218
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,920
Damn you Straw Hats!

219
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,420
Tontattas!

220
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,040
Thank you for knocking Sugar out!

221
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,860
How dare you free our servants!

222
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,270
There's no way
I'm letting you get out of here!

223
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,800
Usoland!

224
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,290
Are you okay?!

225
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,750
Guys! Please look after Usopp!

226
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,120
Okay!

227
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,300
Let's run!

228
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,890
Don't let him lay a finger on Usoland!

229
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,490
You guys want to destroy the SMILE factory!

230
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,860
Isn't that right, Nico Robin?!

231
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,550
Sticky-Sticky Chain!

232
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,200
Wait!

233
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,900
A Giant!

234
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,840
You guys are the Little People.

235
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,800
Let me borrow him for a sec.

236
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,900
Usoland!

237
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,520
He's hurt so bad.
He must've fought so hard to save us...

238
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,840
Guys, look!

239
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:32,960
I heard some of you have been living
as a toy for a decade.

240
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,000
How painful is that?

241
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:50,170
"YOU" ARE HURTING ME  "DO"N'T MOVE ME

242
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,270
You...

243
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,340
Do...

244
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,650
If it weren't for you,
we would've lived as toys forever!

245
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,330
We would've lived as their slaves!
It feels like our lives have been spared!

246
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,950
Take a good look, warriors!

247
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,540
This man is...

248
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,270
...the hero who broke the spell on us!

249
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Vi...

250
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:28,400
STOP MO"VI"NG ME, I SAI"D"

251
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,670
D...

252
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,790
His name is...

253
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,100
Captain Usopp!!

254
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,050
Captain Usopp!!

255
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,650
Thank you!!

256
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,240
Usoland!

257
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,040
--What happened?!
--The ceiling collapsed?!

258
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,020
A heavenly light!

259
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,280
What?!

260
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,730
D-D-Don't tell me
he is a messenger from heaven!

261
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,080
Are we...

262
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
...witnessing a miracle?!

263
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,200
S-So divine! He's like god!

264
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,870
H-Hey everybody, listen!

265
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,000
God Usopp is gonna say something!

266
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,630
You...

267
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,320
...people...

268
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,650
...will...

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,410

...me...

273
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,170
What?! Wh-What did he say?!

274
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,420
PUT ME DOWN, "YOU" IDIOT

275
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,720
You...

276
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,190
"PEOPLE" LIKE YOU ARE THE WORST

277
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,190
...people...

278
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,230
"WILL" YOU STOP

279
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,610
...will...

280
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,830
HEY "BE"EFY "GUY", OPEN YOUR BLIN"DED" EYES

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,370
"ME"ATHEAD

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,640
...me...

287
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,310
"YOU" "PEOPLE" "WILL" "BE"
"GUY" "DED" "BY" "ME"

288
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,330
"You people will be guided by me"?!

289
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,980
"You people will be..."

290
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,700
"...guided by me"!

291
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,420
So you really are...

292
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,730
...sent from heaven...

293
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,730
to be our savior!

294
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:55,160
God Usopp! God Usopp! God Usopp!...

295
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,700
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

296
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,870
Usoland! Usoland!

297
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,770
Guide us, God Usopp!
What are we supposed to do?!

298
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,270
--He's right!
--It's our turn to help you!

299
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,080
We want to work for you!

300
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,550
Please! Guide us! Show us the way!

301
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,670
The action we must take!

302
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,930
Then, why don't you destroy
the factory behind me

303
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,440
and rescue our little friends?

304
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,880
At your command!

305
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,310
Usopp!

306
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:08,450
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

307
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,040
What the hell is wrong with...

308
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,440
...these people?

309
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,850
The Fire Fist finally returns!

310
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,180
The mysterious man Lucy who inherits Ace's

311
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,710
will and power comes down into
the darkness of Dressrosa

312
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,380
and when his astonishing
true identity is revealed,

313
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,010
a new history of the three
brothers will begin!

314
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,450
On the next episode of One Piece!

315
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,820
"Dashing onto the Scene!

316
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,230
The Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Army, Sabo!"

317
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,460
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
