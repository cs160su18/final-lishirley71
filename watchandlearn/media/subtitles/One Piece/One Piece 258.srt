2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,160
Well, then...

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,330
Although we got in fights back in
town both with the Franky Family

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,540
and the Galley-La shipwrights,
we're all going after the same enemy now.

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,010
Listen. We're comrades.

6
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,970
Gum-Gum...

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,340
Three-Hundred Pound...

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,930
We're gonna crash!

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,320
...Cannon!

10
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,280
W-We got through!

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,180
Hey, is that you, Luffy?

12
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,770
Oh, Sanji! How's it going
over there? Where's Robin?

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,760
Robin-chan is still in their custody.

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,000
Nami-san just told me
the reasons for her actions.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,400
I see.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,970
Yeah... Well... that's what's going on.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,180
Go ahead and give them hell.

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,330
Don't be reckless, Luffy!

19
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,850
Tell him to wait until we catch up!

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,620
Hey, Cook! Can you hear me?!
There are crazy guys on that train, so...

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,820
That's okay.

22
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,130
Zoro...

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,820
What would you do if it were you?

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,800
Hm?

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,500
After hearing that Robin lied and was
taken into custody in order to save us,

26
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,920
could you just stay put?

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,750
It's no use trying to stop him.

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,910
Hey, Moss Head! Are you worried about me?

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,090
Why would I be, you idiot?!

30
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,920
But sorry...

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,390
After hearing what Robin-chan was thinking...

32
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,390
...even if the Captain orders it,
I'm not gonna stop!

33
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm...

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,740
...not coming.

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,360
It no longer has anything to do with me, right?

36
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,900
If the World Government itself
becomes your enemy at last,

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,860
I don't wanna be part of it.

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,610
You'll join with Luffy and
the others as well, right?

39
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:38,170
I'm sorry, but I'm no longer
honor-bound to go rescue Robin!

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,730
I left the Straw Hats!

41
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,410
See ya.

42
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,550
Oof.

43
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,020
Ah!

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,230
Ahhh! I found them!

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,940
Oh, shoot!

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,360
Metallic Star!

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,240
Who's there?!

48
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,880
He told me everything.

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,730
I heard that you guys want
to rescue a mademoiselle.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,780
That alone is reason enough
for me to lend a hand.

51
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,430
I will fight alongside you!

52
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,020
My name is...

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,520
...Sogeking!

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:47,990
"Sniper Warrior
Sogeking"

55
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:04,760
I was born on the island of snipers

56
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,560
I never miss my mark

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,270
Lulu lala lu

58
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,360
Whether it's a mouse's eyeball, lock on!!

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,070
Or even your heart, lock on!!

60
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:29,160
The man who hails from the island of snipers

61
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,410
Lululu, lulu lala

62
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,090
Now... run away!

63
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,050
Sogege, soge, soge

64
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:47,220
Sogeking!

65
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,680
"Sniping"

66
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,310
It's all right! Now let's move forward

67
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,730
with the sun always in our hearts

68
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,110
As power passes through our clasped hands

69
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,410
let's grab hold of our wishes

70
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:29,800
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,970
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

72
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,940
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

73
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:51,070
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

74
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,570
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

75
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,410
but what you cherish most will be right there

76
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,450
And if you get into a jam

77
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,460
I'll always be there to protect you

78
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,710
It's all right! Now let's move forward

79
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,170
with the sun always in our hearts

80
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,430
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

81
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,680
and gaze at the light beyond

82
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,390
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

83
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,690
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

84
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,110
So let's grab hold of our wishes

85
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,530
under the same flag-- together, we're one

86
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,870
One Piece

87
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,290
"A Mysterious Man Appears?!
His Name Is Sogeking!"

88
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,020

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,280
What the heck is he doing?

93
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,090
Well, try to understand his feelings.

94
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,120
He feels that he can't go rescue
her outright as a friend.

95
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,940
So this is his own way of settling things.

96
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,860
♪ The man who hails from
the island of snipers... ♪

97
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,120
Geez... what a pain.

98
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,670
Hey! Come over here!

99
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,970
Oh, okay.

100
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,530
Okay, then. We'll have the meeting
for Operation Rescue Robin-chan now.

101
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,490
We've never met before. Don't you
guys have any questions about me?

102
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,520
First of all, the car you guys were in
was #6, so there are five more cars left.

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,850
You know, like,
"Where is the island of snipers?"

104
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,800
Robin-chan is in one of those cars.

105
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,340
Why, it's in your heart!

106
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,990
By the way, are you strong?

107
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,530
I'm super strong, you idiot!

108
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm especially strong this week!

109
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,740
If we can rescue Robin-chan
in the end, we win, but...

110
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,350
...there are a lot of enemies.

111
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,140
If we carelessly jump the gun
and get surrounded

112
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,320
in a small space like a train,
that'll be a problem.

113
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,280
So it's probably best if we
avoid any unnecessary fights

114
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,180
and crush the main forces in turns.

115
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,890
Makes sense.

116
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,450
It's best if we don't fight.
That sure is a good point, Sanji-kun.

117
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,310
So, that leads me to a possible strategy.

118
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,990
Huh?

119
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,170
Look... Listen carefully.

120
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,680
Th-This is...

121
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,790
Amazing...

122
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,370
Okay! Now I'm ready for battle!

123
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,740
Hm? What're you guys doing?

124
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,240
Don't "What're you guys doing?" us!

125
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,320
How dare you so openly change in
front of everyone, you shameless girl?!

126
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,380
Nice shamelessness.

127
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,380
I couldn't help it. We only have one car.

128
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,120
Hide your belly! Belly and legs!

129
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,920
You guys, too, Square Sisters!

130
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,250
People like you corrupt society!

131
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,390
Shut up, you shy man.

132
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,690
Shy man.

133
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,810
You little...

134
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,670
If you like, I'll change, too.

135
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,640
I'm sorry, but please don't! Seriously!

136
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,530
What rude guys.

137
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,820
Dammit!

138
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,980
I wish they had made the pockets
in these black shorts bigger.

139
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,200
Don't pack meat in your pockets!

140
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,490
You guys seem refreshed.
You're full of enthusiasm.

141
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,700
Of course! This is in order to rescue Robin!

142
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,910
We'll beat them all up this time for sure!

143
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,850
You'd better! If you get stuck
somewhere again, I'm not gonna forgive you!

144
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,880
I'll be fine! I've got a
reason I won't lose this time!

145
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,040
A reason...

146
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,220
Hm? Nami, did you change your weapon?

147
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,980
Hm? No.

148
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,360
After we came back from the sky island,

149
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,200
Usopp improved it and
made it stronger using dials.

150
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,530
It's the Perfect Clima Takt.

151
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,910
I see. So it's Usopp's...

152
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,190
That's right! It's Usopp's...

153
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,710
Yeah... It's his last work.

154
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,790
Don't go bumming people out!

155
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,890
Ready? Well then, let's go.

156
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,970
An intruder?

157
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,460
Y-Yes, sir. That's what I heard.

158
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,680
It's not possible to get on board
Puffing Tom while it's running.

159
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,560
If there really is an intruder,

160
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
it means that we let him come
on board when we departed.

161
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,230
Good grief...

162
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Coo coo.

163
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,580
I agree. It's embarrassing.

164
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,520
But at the same time, it's not possible
to get off while it's running, either.

165
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,960
The intruder as well as the criminals
are certainly still on this sea train.

166
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,640
Keep calm and look for them.

167
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,680
Yes, sir!

168
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,980
"Car #7"

169
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,140
Captain T-Bone... Hiding in a
small place like this would be hard.

170
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,120
Hm?

171
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,840
Good evening!

172
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,170
There they are!

173
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,400
They're behind the door!

174
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,210
We've found three suspicious men,
including the criminals!

175
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,050
They're in car #7! Corner and capture them!

176
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,120
The way you're using the hammer is no good.

177
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,760
Shut up!

178
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,960
Stop this futile resistance!

179
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,810
Open the door!

180
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,650
Hurry up and board it up!

181
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,020
I-I know.

182
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,220
Guys! This way! Suspicious men
were found in car #7!

183
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,220
You found them?!

184
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,140
Let those in car #3 know, too!

185
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,030
We'll corner them and capture
the criminal Franky alive!

186
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,910
There's no place to escape to!
Seize them carefully!

187
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,330
Hey! Stay back!

188
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,170
Whoa! They started shooting!

189
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,440
Hurry up, Soge!

190
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,180
Well, a little help would be nice!

191
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,540
Don't shoot blindly! We can't kill them!

192
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,520
Dammit!

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,540
Captain T-Bone...

194
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,180
Step aside.

195
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,580
I hate crooked sword attacks.

196
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,940
Right-Angle Flash!

197
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,160
Bone Soir!

198
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,290
I hate crooked sword attacks.

199
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,360
Right-Angle Flash!

200
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,240
Bone Soir!

201
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,300
Th-They're not here!

202
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,180
Are they on the roof?!

203
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,270
Hurry up! Our enemy is at
the very end of the train!

204
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,800
Now! Hurry!

205
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,620
Don't tell me...

206
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,600
All, go back to the front cars! This is a trap!

207
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,120
A trap?!

208
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,990
--What the...?!
--Go back! This is a trap!

209
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,990
What?!

210
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,300
Even if we want to go back, the door is...

211
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,800
Who was that?!

212
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,730
The cars are detached!

213
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,840
What?!

214
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,040
Dammit! They're the ones who did it!

215
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,770
You bastards! You'll regret this!

216
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,850
So it was too late...

217
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,260
Well then, gentlemen! Watch out
for Sea Kings! Have a nice trip!

218
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,990
Take care!

219
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,240
Two cars' worth...

220
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,200
With this, at least fifty small fries
or so must've been taken care of.

221
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,440
But, Sanji-kun...

222
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,110
Aren't Straw Hat Luffy and the
others coming on the same railway?

223
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,250
Well, they'll probably do something about it.

224
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:51,940
Y-You bastards! Time to be
blown away along with the door!

225
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,130
Oh, going somewhere?

226
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,970
What?!

227
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,680
All right, then. Let's take care of
the remaining five cars, shall we?

228
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,630
Y-You son of a bitch! Don't think
you can get away with this!

229
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,800
How dare you do such terrible
things to even Captain T-Bone?!

230
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,840
Hey! Report this to CP9!

231
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,110
So there are more small fries?

232
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,390
Frit... Assorti!

233
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,870
Sogeking... Gunpowder Star!

234
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,670
Strong... Right!

235
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,590
--What?
--Huh?

236
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,500
Heavyweight bullets... Fire!

237
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,470
Whoa!

238
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,260
They hit him!

239
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,320
--Ow...
--Wha...

240
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,230
Fire! Fire!

241
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,770
How come the gun isn't working?!

242
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,680
Huh?!

243
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,670
Hey! What the hell are you?!

244
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,650
Hm?

245
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,980
Oh, I'm a cyborg.

246
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,270
A cyborg?!

247
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,410
That's right. Steel and weapons
are built into my body.

248
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,450
If I'm shot, it hurts a little
and sometimes it bleeds too,

249
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,490
but, well, it doesn't work.

250
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,700
Something like that is possible?

251
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,680
The world is a big place, huh?

252
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,660
Amazing!

253
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,370
--How's this?
--Ouch!

254
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,600
What're you doing, you jerk?!

255
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,400
What? Isn't a needle small enough
that it doesn't hurt at all?

256
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,200
You idiot! How dare you
start a dreadful experiment?!

257
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,060
Then, I'll tell you this before you
go any further. The back is different!

258
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,170
Look. I did the makeover by myself,
so I couldn't reach the back side.

259
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,310
Only the front side is cyborg.

260
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,890
I see...

261
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,250
Well then, while I'm at it,
I'll tell you one more thing.

262
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,500
My belly tends to feel cold.
Why do you think that is?

263
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,780
How would I know?

264
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,970
That's because I've got a
fridge in my belly to chill cola.

265
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,670
Whoa! That's handy!

266
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,740
That's amazing! That'd be great for hot days!

267
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,940
Hey! This is no time for a conversation like that!

268
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,380
We've beat all the enemies in this car!
It's cleared! Let's go to the next car!

269
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,430
Next is car #4.

270
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,640
"Car #4"

271
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm Wanze! I'm mad, mad Wanze!

272
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,360
Huh?

273
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Now, now, now!

274
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,530
I'm Wanze!

275
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,020
Hey, you guys! Are you hungry?

276
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,480
I'm Wanze. I'm the head steward,
so I can cook anything!

277
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,020
Would you like ramen noodles?
Well then, I'll make ramen noodles.

278
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,130
But before that, there's a snippet
of knowledge I want you to have.

279
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,330
My nose hairs look like this!

280
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,160
They're reticulate inside, which means
they look like fishnet pantyhose.

281
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,890
Keep that in mind!

282
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,850
"Flour"

283
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,770
Okay, then! First, I'll put the flour
in my mouth and knead it well.

284
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,680
Now, bon appetit!

285
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,030
Who'd eat that?!

286
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,800
That was a waste of time.

287
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,250
Wanze, we're keeping someone waiting.

288
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,030
So, we're in a hurry. See ya.

289
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,000
Hold it!

290
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,750
If you want to pass through this car,
you'll have to defeat me first!

291
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,630
Are you trying to stop us?

292
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,560
I will stop you! Now, now, now!

293
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,970
For this escort mission on the sea train,

294
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,350
I'm here to deal with attacks
like this just in case they happen!

295
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:26,490
If you want to let the criminal free,
then beat my Ramen Kenpo!

296
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,410
R-Ramen Kenpo?!

297
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,620
"R-Ramen Kenpo?!"

298
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,380
That son of a bitch! He's mocking me!

299
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,900
Don't be taken in, idiot!
You're playing right into his hands!

300
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,130
Now, now, now! How was my
impersonation of that idiot?

301
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,780
--Grrr!
--Like I said, don't be taken in!

302
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,830
Now, now, now, now!

303
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,220
What a restless guy.

304
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,480
What?! The bullets grazed him,

305
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,730
and yet his expression didn't change.
He even looks relaxed...

306
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,600
I-I thought my heart would jump out of my skin!

307
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,210
So you were shocked?!
Don't show confusing expressions!

308
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,770
I'll take care of an annoying jerk like him!

309
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,740
Wait, you guys.

310
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,140
If you're taken in by him like this all
the time, it'll just slow things down.

311
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
I'll make short work of him.

312
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,700
What upsets me is that someone
like you would call yourself a cook!

313
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,470
I'm talking to you!

314
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,850
Hey! You've been taken in!

315
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,210
But look! He dodged Sanji's kick easily!

316
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,950
What's with his relaxed expression?!

317
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,930
I thought I was a goner!

318
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,550
So you were shocked?!

319
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,950
Stop that pattern!

320
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,370
At any rate...

321
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,590
...leave this guy to me.

322
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,710
You guys go to the next car.

323
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,360
We had a dream that day

324
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,150
Our belief in ourselves

325
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:47,220
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

326
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:56,770
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

327
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:06,940
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

328
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:15,480
In the end, we can all surely smile

329
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,330
I'm gonna beat you up using
my mad, mad Ramen Kenpo!

330
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,650
I hate those who play with food!

331
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,840
Don't talk so saucy when you're
an amateur who can't even cook!

332
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,870
Pardon me for being saucy.

333
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,300
This isn't quite a token of my apology,

334
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,310
but shall I show you how a first-class
cook handles kitchen knives?

335
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,200
On the next episode of One Piece!

336
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,550
"Showdown Between Cooks!
Sanji vs. Ramen Kenpo"

337
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,570
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
