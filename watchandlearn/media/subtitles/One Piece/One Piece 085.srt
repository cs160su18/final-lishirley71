00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,920
"An Outcast's Dream!
Hiriluk the Quack!"

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,990
Day 3. Prognosis, the
bacteria were reduced to 30%.

23
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,410
Whoa! You're amazing!

24
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,250
Just as you'd expect from a monster!

25
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,140
But what happens if I do this?

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,930
Poke, poke...

27
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,060
What?! What're you doing?!

28
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,820
So funny!

29
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,200
Shut up! Go away!

30
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,060
Won't you become my friend?

31
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,910
I really really like you!

32
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,290
Y... Your friend?

33
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,060
Become a pirate!

34
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,890
I'm not interested in pirates at all.

35
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,250
And I never wanted a friend!

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,260
If you become my friend,
my other friends will all be happy!

37
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,610
Wait!

38
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,710
Why would I wanna
become your friend?!

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,210
Don't insult me!

40
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,320
You're definitely funny!

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,450
I'll definitely make
you become my friend!

42
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,700
In order for you to get
a healthy smile back,

43
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,240
I prepared an exceptionally
nutritious dish...

44
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,070
Thank you, Sanji-kun.

45
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,290
though you're still painfully beautiful
even after what your body's been through...

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,170
Good lord! When did you use
my kitchen without asking?

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,580
Madam, the roast over there is for you.

48
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,340
It's high in protein and
is good for rejuvena--

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,350
Ahhh!

50
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,740
I'm not a "madam."

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,820
I'm a sparkling single...
and still youthful.

52
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,470
You're still 139 years old... right?

53
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,850
Doctorine! Help me!

54
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,600
Wait! Hey! Wait!

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,980
Wait!

56
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,570
Wait! Wait!

57
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,490
What're you doing?

58
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,160
This guy's gonna join us
and become our friend!

59
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,910
Oh, really?!

60
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,350
I didn't say that!

61
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,050
You did.

62
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,200
--I didn't!
--You did!

63
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,080
Be quiet, both of you!

64
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,530
Wait!

65
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,180
Wait!

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,180
Friend, huh?

67
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,130
How deep a meaning
that word has to him...

68
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,140
To ask without knowing that...

69
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,840
There was one man whom
he opened up to when he was alone...

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,340
The man's name was Dr. Hiriluk.

71
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,160
He was a quack who gave Chopper
a name and called him son.

72
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,630
Hold it!

73
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,250
Did you find him?!

74
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,800
No! We can't find him!

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,230
That darn quack, Hiriluk!

76
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,100
We'll catch him no matter what!
Those're Wapol-sama's orders!

77
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,920
--Yes sir!
--Yes sir!

78
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,770
Dammit!

79
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,520
You can't go on like this.

80
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,340
Let's call a doctor.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,040
No. There aren't any
doctors in this country...

82
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,430
except for the Twenty MDs
who belong exclusively to Wapol...

83
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,900
We'll beg Wapol and call
the Twenty MDs. I'll go.

84
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,420
You don't have to.

85
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,960
I'll examine him.

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,140
Hiriluk!

87
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,650
N-no thank you!
Please don't!

88
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,070
A bunch of people you treated
ended up getting worse!

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,760
Don't be modest.

90
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,270
I just developed a wonderful
all-purpose drug yesterday.

91
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,940
You're lucky.

92
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,910
Hmm? It's not what you think.
This is a tranquilizer gun.

93
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,000
I use it when the
patient's pain is severe.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,690
I... I'm gonna go get the guards!

95
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,420
Please leave!
If you want money, I'll pay!

96
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,680
I don't take money from sick people.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,950
I just want to help you.

98
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,320
Don't! Stop it! I've got a family!

99
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,270
Croak! Croak, croak!
Croak, croak, croak!

100
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,440
Croak! Croak!
Croak, croak! Croak!

101
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,770
Hmm? This is strange.
Did I use a wrong ingredient?

102
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,590
I thought frog extract would work...

103
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,900
Guess it was a failure. Oh man...

104
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,470
S-Sorry... I didn't
mean for this to happen...

105
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,530
Hiriluk! Are you there?!

106
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,440
--Hold it!
--Hold it!

107
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,590
Hmm?

108
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,920
Are you happy, young man?

109
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,630
The doctor hunt has come
to the final stage.

110
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,120
I hear that you and I are the
only doctors left in this country.

111
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,610
Wapol is trying desperately to catch us.

112
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,980
Even if that wasn't the case, you're
already an outcast in this country...

113
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,880
since you're the worst of the quacks.

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,040
I won't get caught by some doctor hunt.

115
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,280
I'll save this country using
medical science one day.

116
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,280
Oh? Didn't you mean to say
"destroy the country"?

117
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,210
There're people on the bridge!

118
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,190
I'll see you around, quack.

119
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,660
I don't wanna see you again,
you thieving doctor.

120
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,740
I'll never get caught!

121
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,630
I'll save as many sick people as possible!

122
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,560
Hmm?

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,020
You've been shot?

124
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,390
We need to stop the bleeding
right away or you'll die!

125
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,740
Don't worry. I'll save you!

126
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,370
It's a yeti! Shoot him to death!

127
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,760
I just made an ointment that even
works on broken bones 3 days ago.

128
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,160
You're lucky.

129
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Don't let him get away!

130
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,760
Kill him!

131
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,100
Shoot him!

132
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,750
What are you?
You don't look like a human.

133
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,900
Oh, yeah. You're that yeti that
people have been talking about...

134
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,670
Yeah! It hit him!

135
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,830
It wasn't enough! Finish him!

136
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,200
H... How dare you...

137
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,760
Who do you think...

138
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,890
I am?!

139
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,670
Hey! Wait!

140
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,360
I will never shoot you!

141
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,490
My name is Dr. Hiriluk!

142
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,110
I'm a doctor!

143
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,020
That was Chopper and Hiriluk's
first encounter.

144
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,940
So what happened...

145
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,890
to the reindeer taken in by Hiriluk?

146
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,030
What?! You can talk?!

147
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,530
Why did you stay quiet for 3 days?

148
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,490
I thought you'd hate me if I talked...

149
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,420
When I talked to humans the other day,

150
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,060
they shot me...

151
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,260
because it's strange for
a reindeer to speak...

152
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,290
You speak, so what?!

153
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,310
I can speak, too...
a lot better than you can.

154
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,350
Get out of here! Chopper!

155
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,500
What?

156
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,880
Dammit! It failed again!

157
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,730
Hey, are you okay, Chopper?!

158
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,170
Hmm? Well, you aren't okay
to start with, I guess...

159
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,880
Why are you calling me Chopper?

160
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,130
You're Tony Tony Chopper.

161
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,940
After all, you're a reindeer and have
fine antlers that could chop down trees.

162
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
That's a cool name, isn't it?

163
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,190
That's what I'll call you.

164
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,720
Chopper...

165
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,950
Listen, Chopper.

166
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,570
Always observe patients,
and give them proper treatment.

167
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,300
Doing so will save people's lives.

168
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,750
Let's go! Patients are waiting
for me today once again.

169
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,870
Get out of here, quack!

170
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,470
I thought lizard eyeballs would work...

171
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,810
Never come back!

172
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,820
Go away!

173
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,470
Run! It's the guards!

174
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,750
Chopper! We'll use the decoy plan!

175
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,680
What's that?!

176
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,400
Take care!

177
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:12,810
What?

178
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,020
You almost got me killed!

179
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,720
Oh yeah?!

180
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,780
You failed to die once already!
You clumsy blue nose!

181
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Don't call me blue nose!

182
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,590
Doctor...

183
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,660
Hmm?

184
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,930
This is... the first time
I've fought with someone...

185
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,960
Makes sense...

186
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,930
To fight, you have to have an opponent.

187
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,890
Then... is it your first time
for this as well?

188
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,140
Hmm?

189
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,230
I'll give it to you. It's a gift...
as a memento of our making up.

190
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,700
A gift? Making up?

191
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,200
We both go through hardships
as outcasts, don't we?

192
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,750
But don't hold a grudge against humans.

193
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,320
This country is sick right now.

194
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,770
Both the citizens and the king
suffer from a sickness of the heart.

195
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,580
People would probably say that
you can't treat a sick country,

196
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,680
but that's not true.

197
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,140
Once my invention is complete,
this country will be saved!

198
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,950
There used to be a master-thief
in a country in the far west.

199
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,140
He had a serious heart disease.

200
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,040
He went to see every possible skilled
doctor and got treated by them,

201
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,200
but no one was able to cure him.

202
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,190
After being told he'd die,
he passed by a mountain

203
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,040
while frustrated and unsettled.

204
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,370
There... he saw a sight that
he had never seen in his life.

205
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,020
Cherry blossoms!

206
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,780
He saw vivid cherry blossoms
all over the mountain!

207
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,320
And then, he went to see another
doctor and was shocked...

208
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,060
because he was told...

209
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,670
"You're completely healthy."

210
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,560
What?

211
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,990
He was cured!

212
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,500
It was indeed a miracle!
Don't you think?

213
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,480
But this was unmistakably
medical science!

214
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
By being emotionally moved,

215
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,790
some sort of change
happened in this man's body!

216
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,760
In other words, there's no disease
in this world that can't be cured.

217
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,800
No matter what anyone says about me,

218
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,870
I'll save this country as a doctor!

219
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,930
That's why I raised this skull
towards all the diseases!

220
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,510
Skull...

221
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,880
This is a symbol of the belief
that nothing is impossible!

222
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,380
I will save this country as a doctor!

223
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,010
By raising this,
I'll fight just like pirates do!

224
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,530
Hey! Reindeer!

225
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,540
Join us and become our friend!

226
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,560
Hmm? Whoa! That looks delicious!

227
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,920
It's cool to be a pirate!

228
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,250
Doctor, what are pirates?

229
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,560
Pirates?

230
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,530
Pirates are incredible guys at sea.

231
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,200
They have large, well-trained
bodies and eyes like an eagle.

232
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,880
Their voices are like
a thunder splitting the sky!

233
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,050
Are you... really a pirate?!

234
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,690
Hmm?

235
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,120
Yeah, I am...

236
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,600
Like I've been saying, join us!

237
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,070
It's fun to be a pirate! Pirates sing, too.

238
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,200
What? Th-they sing?

239
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,740
Yeah. And they dance, too!

240
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,960
You call that being a pirate?!

241
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,910
That's right!
And they go on lots of adventures!

242
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,370
Adventures?

243
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,580
So pirates go on adventures then?

244
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,210
Of course!

245
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,640
Pirates risk their lives
to go on adventures!

246
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,850
You can meet lots of amazing people!

247
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,970
It's cool to be a pirate!

248
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,790
There're tons of incredible guys at sea!

249
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,220
Chopper, go out to sea some day.

250
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,620
If you do, you'll understand very
well how small your problems are.

251
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,620
This island that you were born on
is like this compared to the world.

252
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,430
Really?

253
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,170
No, it's smaller! Like this! It's true!

254
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,220
Your future lies beyond that sea!

255
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,000
The good times passed
in the twinkling of an eye...

256
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,340
And...

257
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,310
The time to bid farewell...

258
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,290
comes for everyone...

259
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,610
It took one year.
Now your treatment is complete.

260
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,580
Your injuries are
completely healed, Chopper.

261
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes! Thank you, Doctor!

262
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,910
Well then... take care...

263
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,470
What?

264
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,160
Now, leave! Live as you please!
I'm busy with my research!

265
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,010
I no longer have any moral
obligation to take care of you!

266
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,560
Doctor!

267
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,840
I'll never cause you any trouble!
Please let me in!

268
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,670
I'll massage your shoulders everyday!
I'll make you tea and clean the house!

269
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,810
Please! Let me stay!

270
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,280
I don't have any friends!
I have no place to go!

271
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,900
Doctor!

272
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,370
Doctor!

273
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
Doctor!

274
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,700
Doctor!

275
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,160
Chopper!

276
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,140
Look at this, Doctor. I'm injured.

277
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,770
Hey, Doctor!

278
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,020
Look at this!

279
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,640
Why... Doctor?

280
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,880
Go... to the sea! Go anywhere!

281
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,360
Don't ever come back here!

282
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,660
Forgive me, Chopper!

283
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,080
I'm gonna... die...

284
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,600
Yeah, you will...

285
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,960
Tell me! How many more days do I have?

286
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,490
Oh? If you're asking me
to examine you, I refuse.

287
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,200
You don't have the money to pay my fee.

288
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,490
Tell me!

289
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,140
You can't kill a person
with a tranquilizer gun!

290
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,540
I'll tell you. You'll die at 5 pm
on the 10th day from today.

291
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,550
You won't have to suffer any more.

292
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,130
10 days... That'll be enough...

293
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,830
In 2 days...

294
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,620
In 2 days, I'll complete the research
I've continued for 30 years...

295
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,140
I will... make cherry blossoms
bloom in this country!

296
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,600
Cherry blossoms?

297
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,220
So the research you've
continued for 30 years

298
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,480
was about making cherry blossoms bloom?

299
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,440
The miracle cherry blossoms that
saved you, a master thief, long ago?

300
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,740
That's right!

301
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,570
What?

302
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,780
You're a fool.

303
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,180
This is a winter island
where it's bitter cold year around.

304
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,290
Cherry blossoms won't bloom here.

305
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,290
They will!
I was a hopeless thug and dying,

306
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,750
but I lived on and was able to
have a profound change of heart.

307
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,460
Every human in this world can be saved!

308
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,330
I'd like to prove it here in Drum,
the land where I was born!

309
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,020
Listen.

310
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,170
What you're trying to do isn't
medical science or any science.

311
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,260
Even if the cherry blossoms bloom,
it will do nothing to human bodies.

312
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,940
Hiriluk!

313
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Chopper! We're alike.

314
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,030
So I will at least teach you before I die...

315
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,130
that there's nothing
impossible in this world...

316
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,820
and that you can do anything, too!

317
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,790
But the story of these two
doesn't have a happy ending...

318
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,010
I'll show you...

319
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,020
the miracle cherry blossoms!

320
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,450
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

321
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

322
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

323
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:57,560
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

324
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

325
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,310
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

326
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

327
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,290
Hey, Luffy. Are you really listening to--

328
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,620
Hey, where'd he go?!

329
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,950
Geez... I wonder if he's
chasing Tony-kun again...

330
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,050
He's refusing!

331
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,390
That's not true! Are you stupid?!

332
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,390
I've decided to make him join us
and become our friend!

333
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,560
But that's just what you want, right?!

334
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,950
Seriously... I wonder if there's
any medicine that works on fools...

335
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

336
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,290
"Hiriluk's Cherry Blossoms
And The Will That Gets Carried On!"

337
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
