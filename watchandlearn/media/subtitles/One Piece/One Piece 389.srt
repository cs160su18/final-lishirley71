00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered
just before his death

6
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

7
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,200
My treasure?

8
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,470
If you want it, you can have it!

9
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,820
Find it!

10
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

11
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,260
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,630
On the way to their next
destination, Fishman Island,

14
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,060
Luffy and friends helped save
Camie's friend, Hatchin.

15
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,650
The Straw Hats fought a hard battle against
the kidnapping gang, the Flying Fish Riders.

16
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,280
That's when they saw the true identity of
Duval, who held a burning hatred for Sanji.

17
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,540
Stop screwing around!

18
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,300
Unleash the Sunny's Super Secret
Weapon, the Gaon Cannon!

19
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,090
That face... Is that even possible?

20
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,340
Incredible...

21
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,200
There's actually someone who looks just
like that scribble on Sanji's wanted flyer!

22
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,570
"Black Foot" Sanji, it's all your fault!

23
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,660
Hey, Sanji! Where are you going?

24
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,490
Do you know how scared I was when
people suddenly wanted me dead?

25
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,800
Why? Why did I have to be chased
all the way to Navy HQ?!

26
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,710
Why do I have to be nearly killed
by famous bounty hunters?!

27
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,190
Why?!

28
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,360
Sanji?

29
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,980
All because you made a name
for yourself as a pirate,

30
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:13,120
I've had to live every day in
fear, running around and hiding!

31
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,710
What did I even do?!

32
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,250
Give me my life back!

33
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,130
"Black Foot" Sanji!

34
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,680
What do I care?!

35
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,060
Head!

36
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,110
How can you not care?!

37
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,490
Who else could be responsible
for this but you?!

38
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,530
Shut up! I'm the one who's
pissed about that wanted flyer!

39
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,260
I know how the poor guy feels...

40
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,380
But Sanji was really upset
about that wanted flyer, too.

41
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,170
Who is this?

42
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,870
Are you gonna be depressed forever?

43
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,260
Shut up! Why is mine the
only hand-drawn one?!

44
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,390
That's all you're worth.

45
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,310
Speak in actual words, would you?

46
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,990
They'll laugh...

47
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,070
All the ladies in the
world will laugh at me...

48
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,990
I never knew stuff like this could happen...

49
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,170
What a shocker. The world
sure is a big place.

50
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,970
Sanji must've been born
under a star of miracles.

51
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,700
He's going to have such an
interesting death someday.

52
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,960
I feel so sorry for that Duval guy...

53
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,050
Hey, they look just like each other!

54
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,170
Two peas in a pod.

55
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,770
Brook! I'm gonna pound you later!

56
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,470
Okay, Sanji, we're going on ahead.

57
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,150
You think this is my fault?!

58
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,600
If you don't want to look like the
flyer, cut your hair or grow a beard!

59
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,570
There are plenty of things you could change!

60
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,710
Oh! I never thought of that!

61
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,590
Are you just stupid to the core?!

62
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,590
I'm not stupid!

63
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,120
You know, Black Foot, we...

64
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,930
You know, Black Foot, we...

65
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,140
We...

66
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,230
...used to be plain old mafia
guys out in the country.

67
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,290
Hey, kid! What did you do to our leader?

68
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,770
Are you her dad?

69
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,530
I-I'm sorry!

70
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,630
Please forgive us!

71
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,760
Honey!

72
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,100
Daddy!

73
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,800
How are you gonna pay me back for this?

74
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,110
Huh?!

75
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,120
Daddy!

76
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,280
Honey!

77
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,780
We went around tormenting
the village folk every day.

78
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,260
It was a happy life, in its own way.

79
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,090
But then, all of a sudden, tragedy
fell upon my peaceful life...

80
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,930
What did he do?

81
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,220
That's a ton of money.

82
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,550
Shouldn't we report him to the Navy?

83
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,970
Here he comes!

84
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,600
It's dangerous to be around him!

85
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,190
We'll get in trouble, too!

86
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,510
Run!

87
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,190
What? Why'd everyone run away?

88
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,730
Ah!

89
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:18,920
At the time, I thought I had finally
been recognized throughout the village.

90
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,390
But then...

91
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,420
We never expected you to escape
this far to the countryside.

92
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,090
We're locking you up!

93
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,840
Why's the Navy after me?

94
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,220
Just do as we say,

95
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,810
"Black Foot" Sanji!

96
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,060
What?!

97
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,860
No way! There's a price on my head?!

98
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,230
A bounty of 77,000,000
Berries... and "Sanji"?!

99
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,920
Apprehend him!

100
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,040
I'm not him! I'm not Sanji, I tell you!

101
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,040
Stop!

102
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,790
I'm gonna be killed!

103
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,000
Do you understand, Black Foot?

104
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,320
I've never done anything
worse than shakedowns,

105
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,390
and suddenly I had a price of
77,000,000 Berries on my head...

106
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,310
The terror of having Navy guys on a totally

107
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,560
different power level chasing me around...

108
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,320
I finally ended up with
a huge wound on my back,

109
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,630
and donned an iron mask so my
face would never be seen again.

110
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,480
My life was ruined because of you!

111
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,820
I will chase you to the ends of Hell itself!

112
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,500
If you don't want that,
then kill me here and now!

113
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,540
I'm gonna be killed!

114
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,880
Why did Nami-san and Robin-chan have

115
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,260
to be put in danger just for your
stupid baseless accusations?!

116
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,640
That's the ship that allowed you to
make a name for yourself as a pirate.

117
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,560
That means its crew is included
in my hatred for you, too!

118
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,020
You can all die!

119
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,120
Poison harpoons!

120
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,530
Assume formation!

121
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,450
Huh? Pervert?

122
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm gonna skewer you, Black Foot!

123
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,130
Die!

124
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,710
That's enough, all of you.

125
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,970
You took the bait, Black Foot!

126
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,350
Crap!

127
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,780
Sanji-kun!

128
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,630
They're gonna drag him underwater!

129
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,480
Sanji! Break the net!

130
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,110
Damn it! An iron net?!

131
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,700
Suffer and drown to death!

132
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,740
Sanji!

133
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,310
Damn it! I'm coming to save you!

134
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,040
You can't, you idiot! I'll go!

135
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,120
Wait! Humans are too slow to catch them!

136
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,260
Leave this to me!

137
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,980
Fool! Even if you're a fishman,
you'll never catch them!

138
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,470
Flying fish are among the
fastest creatures in the sea.

139
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,060
And their riders are equipped
with oxygen tanks,

140
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,310
so they can stay under as long as they like!

141
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,610
He's gonna suffocate and die for sure!

142
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,720
The next time Black Foot
appears on the surface,

143
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,540
it'll be as a pathetic drowned corpse!

144
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,390
What'd you say?!

145
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,210
Feel the Head's wrath, Black Foot!

146
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,590
Can't breathe...

147
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,980
Don't worry!

148
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,480
Camie?!

149
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,070
Hey, cowboy, I think you
forgot about someone.

150
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,440
It's true that flying fish
are faster than fishmen.

151
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,950
They're among the top of their class.

152
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,590
But the race that sits at
the very top of that class

153
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,910
is mermaids!

154
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,700
There's nothing in all this world's oceans

155
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,840
that can match a mermaid's swimming speed!

156
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,240
It'll be okay!

157
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,600
I'll save you, Sanji-chin!

158
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,560
She's that amazing?

159
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,760
They're not a race that can be caught unless
they're completely spacing out, really.

160
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,780
Oh, okay!

161
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,750
Camie! Take care of Sanji!

162
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,140
What is that?!

163
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,090
A giant ship anchor? That's too huge!

164
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,670
Aim for the Straw Hats' pirate ship!

165
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,340
Hit it smack in the middle and sink it!

166
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,850
Some of them have powers! If we fight
them underwater, victory is ours!

167
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,330
This is bad! We're gonna go down in one shot!

168
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,190
Dodge it! Use Burst or the
paddle wheels! Is there time?!

169
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,940
No, it's too late!

170
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,020
Come with me, Usopp! Hurry!

171
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,780
O-Okay!

172
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,750
Stand by at the bow!

173
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,110
G-Got it!

174
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,240
We're using our emergency secret weapon!

175
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,370
Secret weapon?

176
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,830
The Sunny's in trouble!

177
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,620
This is very bad!

178
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,340
Drop it!

179
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,000
No way!

180
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,210
It'll be a direct hit from there.

181
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,890
Sink!

182
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,580
It's coming down!

183
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,070
Drop it!

184
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,990
The Sunny's in trouble!

185
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,950
This is very bad!

186
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,210
Have faith in this ship!

187
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,710
Whoa! Its mane is spinning!

188
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,670
Sink!

189
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,130
It's coming down!

190
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,980
Emergency escape secret
weapon: Chicken Voyage!

191
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,020
What?! They dodged it?!

192
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,020
No way!

193
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,370
I've never heard of a ship that can back up!

194
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,240
Usopp, get inside the bow!

195
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,410
Inside the bow?

196
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,500
Oh, you can go in!

197
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,130
Franky even made all this?

198
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,680
Don't think it's over just
because we dodged that!

199
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,020
There's still more to this ship's strength!

200
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,930
Awesome!

201
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,920
Pour in the cola energy!

202
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,110
What now?

203
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,160
Charge complete!

204
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,630
Hey! What do I do now?

205
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,750
Get as much of them in the circle as you can?

206
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,340
The circle?

207
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,210
You mean this?

208
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,720
Got 'em!

209
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,570
Lock on with the button on the
handle and pull the lever!

210
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,810
So this... and this!

211
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,560
What's that?

212
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,780
Gaon Cannon...

213
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,780
Fire!

214
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,390
Amazing!

215
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,560
You're too moved!

216
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,720
Did ya see what the Sunny can do?!

217
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,240
That took down almost all of the flying fish!

218
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,440
That was all Usopp's skill.
Excellent for a first try!

219
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,560
What awesome power!

220
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,010
Sunny!

221
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,780
The lion is so amazing! I thought
my eyes were about to pop out!

222
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,260
Not that I have any eyes to pop out!

223
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,170
To keep the ship from blowing out

224
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,760
of the water with three barrels
of cola energy sent to the bow,

225
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,730
we pump two barrels of Coup de Burst
into the stern at the same time.

226
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,420
This baby burns through
cola, so I rarely use it.

227
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,590
I'm stuck in the net!

228
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,890
Damn that agile mermaid!

229
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,360
I'm almost there, Sanji-chin! Hang on!

230
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,570
Camie!

231
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,360
Thank goodness! Is Sanji okay?!

232
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,390
Everyone, it looks bad!
Sanji-chin lost a lot of blood!

233
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,080
What?

234
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,240
They got him?

235
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,160
I thought I'd saved him, but then a
bunch of blood flew from his nose...

236
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,370
Wha— A nosebleed?

237
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,950
Forget it. Just let him die there.

238
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,130
Yeah. He looks happy, anyway.

239
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,280
Hang in there, Sanji-chin!

240
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,730
Am I in heaven?

241
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,790
Damn... That bastard is alive?

242
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,400
You've lost a lot of men now.

243
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,140
Curse you!

244
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,520
Then I'll show you what makes
Motobalo so terrifying!

245
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,320
To this day, countless men have
fallen victim to these tough horns.

246
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,170
These horns even tore a
hole in the village dam!

247
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,610
Put him in a cage, and he'll bust out!

248
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:31,160
It was thanks to his horns that I managed
to escape my Navy pursuers with my life!

249
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,290
People call them "Heart-smashing Horns"!

250
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,290
All right. I'll stop him.

251
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,570
Go, Motobalo!

252
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,640
Look out, Luffy!

253
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,690
The horns had nothing to do with it!

254
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,860
Fighting you is a waste of time!

255
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,780
Hey... What's wrong, Motobalo?

256
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,160
His cow's acting weird.

257
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,160
What?

258
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,550
It fainted?

259
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,290
What happened?

260
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,840
Luffy, what did you do?

261
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,170
I didn't do anything!

262
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,810
Motobalo! How could this be, damn it?!

263
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,660
Luffy didn't shoot anything at him.

264
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,030
It looked like he just intimidated him.

265
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,500
What does that mean? He
won by pure intensity?

266
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,850
That giant thing just passed out!

267
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,370
Is that possible?

268
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,200
Curse you Straw Hats!

269
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,040
Wait just a minute, Luffy.

270
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,000
Sanji, I'm glad you're okay.

271
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,420
This all happened because
of false accusations.

272
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,590
I'll finish it.

273
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,180
Finish it?

274
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,270
Black Foot, so long as you live as a pirate,

275
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,750
I will never live in peace!

276
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,610
I've had enough of being
persecuted for nothing!

277
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,020
Shut up.

278
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,780
I never wanted to see the
scribble on that wanted flyer.

279
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,570
It wasn't supposed to exist in real life!

280
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,290
Then you should die!

281
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,130
Œil!

282
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,970
Nez!

283
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,590
Joue! Bouche! Dents!

284
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,790
Menton!

285
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,130
P-Please, no more!

286
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,040
Parage...

287
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,390
Shot!

288
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,000
Enjoy the fine flavors produced
by a weave of supreme techniques,

289
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,440
you bastard.

290
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,510
Attention!

291
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,220
I'll teach you clueless people
how to get to Fishman Island!

292
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,420
First, you have to get a coating
on this ship at a certain island!

293
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,480
That island is—

294
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,370
Look! That's the island!

295
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,180
Cool! A bubble!

296
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,480
Hey, I was still talking...

297
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,830
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,060
"Landing on the Way to Fishman
Island! The Sabaody Archipelago!"

299
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
