I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,150
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,970
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

75
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,960
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,330
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,080
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,600
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,940
who's been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,570
Meanwhile, at the Colosseum,

81
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,140
the final round of the competition is about to start.

82
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,980
I know your background.

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,050
My background?

84
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,710
It's gonna get a little messy, maybe,
but I won't do you wrong.

85
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,730
Launcher!

86
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,930
Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hats!

87
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,840
The Navy is putting the Toy House
under complete siege!

88
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,500
Huh?! Why is the Navy doing that?!

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,640
What?
Somebody, tell me what's going on-in!

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,570
I'm just a newcomer
picked through the World Military Draft

91
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,050
but since being appointed as a Navy admiral,
there is something I want to do.

92
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
What is it?

93
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,780
It is nothing less than...

94
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,170
...the complete abolition of
the Seven Warlord system!

95
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,230
We'll raise the prize on you, Heavenly Demon.

96
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,680
It sounded like you were suggesting
that I'd better kill you now.

97
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,270
--Alright!
--What?

98
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,520
Okay, see you guys!

99
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,120
--Hurry up, Luffy!
--Get in now, Ninja Woman!

100
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,320
What?!

101
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,970
It's him!

102
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,450
The man who has risen to
prominence in this competition!

103
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,740
Here comes our favorite - Lucy!

104
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,560
Watch over me, Ace!

105
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,220
"The Final Round Starts!
Diamante the Hero Shows Up!"

106
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,470
This is the first time Lucy has
entered into these competitions! But...

107
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,130
...his likable character
captured the crowd's heart!

108
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,180
Oh? The next contender coming in

109
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,850
is the man who antagonized the crowds!

110
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:21,230
The captain of a pirate group, Barto Club,
Bartolomeo the Cannibal!

111
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,250
Here he comes!

112
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,870
The captain of the first ship of
Emperor Blackbeard's group -

113
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,010
Jesus Burgess!

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,590
The Flare-Flare Fruit will be ours!
But good luck to you, Straw Hat!

115
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,380
Oh! Now coming in to the sound of
the crowd's boos and jeers is...

116
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,610
...the "Phantom Princess" of
the heinous King Riku Family!

117
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,580
Rebecca!

118
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,100
Rebecca is... What should we say?
The devil incarnate, maybe?

119
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,740
How did she survive the Block D battle
against such tough contenders?!

120
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,910
It's still a mystery!

121
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,250
G-Gyats-san, are you alright?!
You're getting too excited!

122
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,630
I need some water...

123
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,460
I thought I was gonna die!

124
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,180
And now, these four competitors who

125
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,460
won each block by beating so
many strong contenders are...

126
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,870
...going to fight another battle in the

127
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,520
final round to be a champion
of the Corrida Colosseum!

128
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,510
It's going to start soon!

129
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,770
Who is that? He's not the Lucy that I knew.

130
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,740
Now, let me introduce the man
who is going to fight these four!

131
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,200
He saved this country along with our king,
Don Quixote Doflamingo,

132
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,270
and is one of the top
executives of the Family!

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,870
He is also the promoter of
the Corrida Colosseum Battle Tournament,

134
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,790
and our hero!

135
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,410
There he is!

136
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,960
Mr. Diamante!

137
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,390
N-Now, they're all there!

138
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,980
It's the final here in the Corrida Colosseum!

139
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,600
DIAMANTE - A TOP EXECUTIVE
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY

140
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,500
The four winners from the first round

141
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,620
and Mr. Diamante!

142
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,850
The winner of this round will get...

143
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,680
...a Logia Devil Fruit,
the most powerful type!

144
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,500
The Flare-Flare Fruit!

145
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,030
It's mine!

146
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,580
Don't start!

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,350
Take Rebecca out of the ring!
Redo the Block D match!

148
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,090
Whoa! We have some kind of problem!

149
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,180
We won't accept
such a confusing result, Rebecca!

150
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,000
We couldn't have been beaten
by a little tramp like you!

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
We're gonna to get it right!

152
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,680
Yeah! Kick her ass!

153
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,610
Hey! Get out of our way!

154
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,110
Don't be such a poor losers! It's over!

155
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,940
Don't ruin my event!

156
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,500
What the hell?!

157
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,860
Now, charge into this!

158
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,100
--Is this a bullfight?!
--Screw you!

159
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,930
Lock.

160
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,610
Although it ripples, it's a steel cape.

161
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,940
I ate the Ripple-Ripple Fruit
and became a flag human!

162
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,980
I can make any material

163
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,560
flap in the wind like a flag,
even my body, just by my touch!

164
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,150
Lock.

165
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,960
Corrida Glaive!

166
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,120
You'd better go back, guys!

167
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,190
We have special kind of Fighting Fish in the water
just for the final.

168
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,340
They love the smell of blood.

169
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,050
It's flying...

170
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,270
Did you guys see that?!
How the Fighting Fish attacked?!

171
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,200
They're so evil! They're
not gonna follow the rules!

172
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,620
They'll attack fighters
while they're still in ring!

173
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,480
They're so savage!

174
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,190
They're not like
the Fighting Fish we had in the first round!

175
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,740
They're the deadliest Fighting Fish
from different schools!

176
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,980
And one of them has...

177
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,440
...the prize of this competition, the Flare-Flare Fruit,
on its back!

178
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,370
The rules of the final round are simple!
The one who gets it

179
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,320
and remains standing in the ring
will be the champion!

180
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,670
All right! The final round starts soon!

181
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,200
It's going to be a battle royal of the five
including Diamante the hero!

182
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,860
A scramble for the Devil Fruit!
A death match involving the Fighting Fish!

183
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,160
Which one of them will win
the Flare-Flare Fruit?!

184
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,110
Okay! Here we go!

185
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,350
The battle is on!

186
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,080
Now, the final battle finally begins!

187
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,980
Ready or not, this is it!

188
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,730
Who is going to win the prize -
the Flare-Flare Fruit?!

189
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,140
None of them are making a move yet!

190
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,640
Who is gonna take action first?!

191
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,370
Oh! Burgess is going at it!

192
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,410
Oh?! Lucy has started running
on the outer circle of the ring!

193
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,710
What is he up to?!

194
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,500
Here it comes.

195
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,680
This is not the one.

196
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,590
Tsk! We don't need the
ones that don't have it!

197
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,630
Don't even show your face!

198
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,100
Are you trying to lure the one
with the prize out, Straw Hat?!

199
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,710
This one doesn't have it, either.

200
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,720
The final is fun!

201
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,660
Of course, it is!
This is the Corrida Colosseum!

202
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,750
I'm running this show!

203
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,330
Every little tool here is
for entertaining the audience!

204
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,600
You mean we're "tools," too?

205
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,070
Well, just enjoy.

206
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,370
It seems like nobody's here.

207
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,030
Alright, we made it!

208
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,970
Wait!

209
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,390
Could you close the door?

210
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,680
IN FRONT OF THE RAMPART TOWER
BENEATH THE "ROYAL PALACE"

211
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,110
Is that the entrance to the palace?

212
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,800
No, it's the entrance of the Rampart Tower
which stands under the palace.

213
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,640
Under?

214
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,870
Yes. To reach to the palace,
we still have to climb up.

215
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,490
The Rampart Tower also has a secret entrance.

216
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,400
Let's go.

217
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,190
Don't let the guards see you.

218
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,540
If we make a scene, they'll call the
executives and then we'll be stuck.

219
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,330
Particularly, if the executive
named "Pica" finds us,

220
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,360
all hopes of facing Doflamingo will be lost.

221
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,100
Where's Luffy-dono?

222
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,040
Hey! Look!

223
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,840
Gum-Gum...

224
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,250
What the hell is that carp doing?!

225
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,850
...Giant...

226
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,760
--What's wrong with this carp?!
--Is it a blowfish?!

227
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,680
...Pistol!

228
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,020
What?!

229
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,490
What the hell is he doing?!

230
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,100
--It's open!
--That's not the issue here!

231
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,780
I can't believe it!

232
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,160
Are you a bubblehead?!

233
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,770
We have no choice! Let's go in!

234
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,460
Since it comes to this, it's faster this way!

235
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,410
Can I take this thing off?!

236
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,590
Do as you like!

237
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,260
Whoa-whoa!

238
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,140
That's...

239
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,560
This is the front entrance
of the Rampart Tower!

240
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,190
Straw Hat Luffy has snuck into the tower!

241
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,410
The Fighting Fish attacks!
But Lucy dodges easily!

242
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,780
Only he can move like that!

243
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,260
What is he talking about?

244
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,520
Was it really him?!

245
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,440
Yes, it was!
He has broken the gate and...

246
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,240
But it can't be him!

247
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,770
Straw Hat is fighting at the Colosseum
under the name Lucy!

248
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,250
This is the Rampart Tower B-2 -
in front of the main dining hall!

249
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,300
It's no mistake!
One of the intruders is Straw Hat Luffy!

250
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,190
And Pirate Hunter Zoro!

251
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,740
And... V-Violet-sama!

252
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,970
Th-There is one more person!

253
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,740
Lucy is showing it off!

254
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,280
Straw Hat Luffy has snuck in?

255
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:58,470
Then, who is the guy
fighting at the Colosseum?!

256
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,930
What the hell is going on?!

257
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,820
Where are you, Mingo?!
