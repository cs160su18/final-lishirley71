00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,580
"Car #7"

3
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,260
Captain T-Bone... Hiding in a
small place like this would be hard.

4
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,760
Hm?

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,790
Good evening!

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,400
There they are!

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,810
They're behind the door!

8
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,940
We've found three suspicious men,
including the criminals!

9
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,390
I hate crooked sword attacks.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,490
Right-Angle Flash!

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,410
Bone Soir!

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,570
Th-They're not here!

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,420
Don't tell me...

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,640
The cars are detached!

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,600
What?!

16
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,280
Dammit! They're the ones who did it!

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,890
You bastards! You'll regret this!

18
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,980
So it was too late...

19
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,300
Well then, gentlemen! Watch out
for Sea Kings! Have a nice trip!

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,110
Take care!

21
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,950
"Car #4"

22
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,710
I'm Wanze! I'm mad, mad Wanze!

23
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,900
Huh?

24
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,450
Now, now, now!

25
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,340
I'm Wanze!

26
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,300
If you want to pass through this car,
you'll have to defeat me first!

27
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,210
Are you trying to stop us?

28
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,970
I will stop you! Now, now, now!

29
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,310
For this escort mission on the sea train,

30
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,870
I'm here to deal with attacks
like this just in case they happen!

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,990
If you want to let the criminal free,
then beat my Ramen Kenpo!

32
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,520
The rear two cars were detached?

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,320
What on earth are you all doing?

34
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,640
We're very sorry.

35
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,580
The fact of the matter is that even
Captain T-Bone, one of our powerhouses,

36
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,000
was in one of the detached cars.

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,140
So, tell me the current situation in the train.

38
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,940
Yes, ma'am! There are five cars
remaining besides the engine room car!

39
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,400
However, all the soldiers in
car #5 have been taken out.

40
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,120
So that leaves only Mr. Wanze in car #4,

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,580
Mr. Nero in car #3,

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,230
Nico Robin in car #1,

43
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,710
and everyone here in car #2!

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,630
It seems like our enemy isn't stupid.

45
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,560
However, if there is a problem here for us,

46
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,840
it's only that Franky is walking around free.

47
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,310
Our mission only requires us to bring
Franky and Nico Robin to Enies Lobby.

48
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,090
Other than that, no matter
how the other enemies die,

49
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,480
or no matter what happens to who on our side,

50
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,150
it won't interfere with our mission.

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,110
So, did you see our enemies?

52
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,640
Yes, ma'am! First, there were
the two that were in custody,

53
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,290
although one of them
was wearing a weird mask.

54
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,030
Also, a blond guy dressed in a suit,
who we've never seen before.

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,280
So, a total of three!

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,060
Hmm, just like the long-nosed man,
that man is probably one of the Straw Hats.

57
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,510
Naturally, his purpose is to recover Nico Robin.

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,220
Franky is helping them out.
That's probably about it.

59
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,220
Lucci, shall I go stand watch over Nico Robin?

60
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,720
That's not necessary.

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,230
Think only about recapturing Franky.

62
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,400
It's definitely not possible for them...

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,630
...to get Nico Robin back.

64
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,220
It's all right! Now let's move forward

65
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,640
with the sun always in our hearts

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,020
As power passes through our clasped hands

67
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,310
let's grab hold of our wishes

68
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:05,700
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

69
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,880
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

70
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

71
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,970
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

72
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,480
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

73
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,310
but what you cherish most will be right there

74
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,360
And if you get into a jam

75
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,360
I'll always be there to protect you

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,620
It's all right! Now let's move forward

77
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,080
with the sun always in our hearts

78
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,330
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

79
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,590
and gaze at the light beyond

80
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,300
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,590
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

82
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,010
So let's grab hold of our wishes

83
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,430
under the same flag-- together, we're one

84
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,770
One Piece

85
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,810
"Showdown Between Cooks!
Sanji vs. Ramen Kenpo"

86
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,880
"Car #4"

87
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,120
At any rate, leave this guy to me.

88
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,160
You guys go to the next car.

89
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,580
Don't forget that this is
Operation Rescue Robin-chan.

90
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,980
"Flour"

91
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,530
That's impossible!

92
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,820
I... won't... let... you... pass... through!

93
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,490
I'll knead alloy flour and...!

94
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,530
Is he gonna bring out ramen noodles again?!

95
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,160
Ramen...

96
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,450
...Beam...!

97
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,080
They can prick you!

98
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,050
Yikes!

99
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,260
Cut it out!

100
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,870
Oof!

101
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:36,970
Tsk!

102
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,370
Let's go around via the roof!

103
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,440
Yeah!

104
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,400
W-Well then, Sanji-kun! I wish you good luck.

105
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,360
Now, now, now!

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,620
They got away so easily!

107
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,680
But that's no use...

108
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,270
...because Nero's waiting
for them in the next car.

109
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,820
Although he's a newbie, he's a member
of CP9, a group of assassins for justice!

110
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,170
They'll die! Nero loves to kill!

111
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,670
Now, now, now, now!

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Flanchet...

113
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,550
...Shoot!

114
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,930
Oof.

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,460
I was born on the island of snipers

116
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,080
"Sniper Warrior
Sogeking"

117
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,040
I never miss my mark

118
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,330
Hmm...

119
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,570
If I at least knew which car Robin is in,

120
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,510
Lulu lala lu

121
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,820
I could just go on the roof
and infiltrate at once.

122
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,880
Whether it's a mouse's eyeball, lock on!!

123
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,300
What're you mumbling about?!
Hurry up and go, you damn Squidy-king!

124
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,680
Or even your heart, lock on!!

125
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,250
Who're you calling "Squidy"?!

126
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,610
The man who hails from the island of snipers

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,640
Hmm... Squidy...?

128
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,930
Hurry up, you damn idiot!

129
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,860
Lululu, lulu lala

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,970
Hey, bikini guy.

131
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,110
Now... run away!

132
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,810
Huh?

133
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,700
I've got a brilliant idea.

134
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,460
Listen carefully.

135
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,470
Tsk...

136
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,380
This'll take forever if you
keep dodging my attacks.

137
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,370
How many times do I need
to tell you I'm in a hurry?

138
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,990
Well then, here comes my attack!

139
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,800
Ramen Kenpo... Noodle Slicer!

140
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,230
Fire...

141
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,640
...Skate!

142
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,440
Ow, ow, ow...!

143
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,330
I got kicked about ten times
the moment he dodged my attack!

144
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,510
Actually, twelve times.

145
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,750
Is it possible... that you're super strong?

146
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,170
It's probably just that your
bark is worse than your bite.

147
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,850
Hey, hey! Not even my
old man has said that to me!

148
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,180
Stop saying that! How rude of you! I'm Wanze!

149
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,650
Even considering that your rare
swirling eyebrows made me dizzy,

150
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,140
you're actually pretty good!

151
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,360
You're one to talk about a rare face!

152
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:50,230
"Flour"

153
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,490
Okay, then! I'll show you
right away why I was chosen

154
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,280
to be in the team to escort the criminals!

155
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,500
Ramen Kenpo! Secret technique!

156
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,730
I'll finish the noodles by beating
them over and over again!

157
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,170
Wha...? What the hell is this?

158
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,440
This is an edible, dream combat uniform!

159
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,570
Ra-men's Formal Suit!

160
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,540
Now, now, now!

161
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,290
The secret of Ramen Kenpo
is controlling noodles at will!

162
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,500
You bastard...

163
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,750
How dare you play with food all this time?!

164
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,130
Speed, power, and special abilities...

165
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm at a different level now in all those areas!

166
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,840
I'll exhibit incomparable strength!

167
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,600
Enough jabbering. Bring it on already.

168
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,320
I'll make you eat all
those noodles, so be prepared.

169
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,570
So...

170
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,010
...who are you?

171
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,730
The one waiting on car #3 is a
newbie in CP9, a Four Powers Master,

172
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,690
Nero the sea weasel. Hiss!

173
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,160
At any rate, I guess you're
one opponent I can't kill...

174
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,620
...since you're one of our important criminals.

175
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:55,010
Hey, buddy! Why are you out on the roof?

176
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,460
If you had just waited, I would've come to you.

177
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,990
Well, you can't tell that for sure, right?

178
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,970
You might've cheated and
skipped this car, right? Hiss!

179
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,290
How cautious you are!

180
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,430
But being on guard is important, huh?

181
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,390
By the way, what's that thing behind you?

182
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,350
Huh?

183
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,290
That was dirty!

184
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,020
Dirty is right! In my town,
I'm the boss of a gang of rogues.

185
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,520
Hm? Where's Luffy?

186
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,820
Hm...? Beats me.

187
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,310
"Beats me"?! What if he
happened to fall into the water?!

188
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,280
Oof! It's slippery!

189
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,140
Can't be. He was right here up
until just now. Right, Chopper?

190
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,810
What? Yeah.

191
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,190
That's no answer! I'm worried because
the person who was here isn't here now!

192
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,360
Maybe he's stuck in the chimney of Rocketman?

193
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,290
He's not me-- Hey, Chopper! You little...!

194
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,640
Just wait, Robin...! And Usopp.

195
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,610
Welcome to the Ramen Kenpo world!

196
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,570
You call this "powered-up"?

197
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,760
Now, now, now! Take this!

198
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,000
Ramen Kenpo! Pork Bone Spank!

199
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,550
That's a useless punch
that you just made bigger.

200
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,410
Now, now, now! Another one!

201
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,370
I-It's stuck!

202
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,900
Oof!

203
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,650
Now, now!

204
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,240
Now, now, now! You dummy!

205
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,110
Are you taken aback by my Ramen Kenpo?!

206
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,050
You look unsightly with your leg
and arm buried in ramen noodles!

207
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,810
How dare you beat the crap
out of me like that earlier?!

208
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,260
--Ah!
--Hm?

209
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,150
What're you getting dizzy for, you jerk?!

210
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,160
You just tried to make me dizzy using
your eyebrows again, didn't you?!

211
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,690
I'm not gonna let you get away with it!

212
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,900
Now, now, now!

213
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,880
Dammit! I can't pull out my leg or my arm!

214
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,980
I can't fight back like this!

215
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,350
Noodle Soul Press!

216
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,540
I'm just getting started!

217
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,320
Another helping! And another!

218
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,990
And another! And another!

219
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,320
And another!

220
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,780
Take that, and that, and that,
and that, and that, and that, and that!

221
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,690
They finally came off.

222
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,920
Now, now, now! Aren't you
underestimating me, you fool?

223
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,810
This is the mad, mad Ramen Kenpo!

224
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,850
To think that I get buried if I attack...

225
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,270
I guess I can't touch those ramen noodles.

226
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,980
Now, I'll keep it coming!

227
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,030
Ramen and Pot Sticker Combo! Clapping!

228
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,580
Then, there's only one area that I can attack.

229
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,750
Escalope!

230
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,480
Ramen Beam!

231
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,560
Now, now, now!

232
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,170
I've got no blind spot!

233
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,030
From what I've been seeing,
your means of fighting is kicking, isn't it?

234
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,970
Kicking is the only means you have, isn't it?

235
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,810
Now, now, now! It's no use! It's no use!

236
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,960
No matter what you do, you'll only
end up being buried in my suit!

237
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,110
Here goes! Try dodging this!

238
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,570
Ramen Kenpo!

239
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,840
Multi-Noodle Spank!

240
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,420
1.4 mm pasta, fedelini...

241
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,050
Huh?!

242
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,800
Sleight of hand?

243
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,170
Ah! My noodle fists are now in pieces!

244
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,790
Hands and kitchen knives are sacred to cooks.

245
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,220
So it's my policy not to use them in a battle.

246
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,680
But if this is a kitchen...

247
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,450
...and my enemy is foodstuff,
then it's a different story.

248
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,150
You're more troublesome than I thought.

249
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Thousand Noodle Whip!

250
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,520
Trying to look cool? How saucy!

251
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,000
An amateur like you who can't even
cook shouldn't hold kitchen knives!

252
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,100
They're different from the
knives that delinquents use!

253
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,890
Pardon me for being saucy.

254
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,330
This isn't quite a token of my apology...

255
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,640
...but I'll show you...

256
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,970
...the exceptional way that a first-class
cook handles kitchen knives!

257
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,020
Hiss!

258
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,060
Shave!

259
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,580
Strong... Hammer!

260
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,550
Paper Art.

261
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,800
Tempest Kick!

262
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,960
Hiss!

263
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,630
Fresh Fire!

264
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,700
Shave!

265
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,030
Wha...?! What's with him?!
He jumped towards the sea on his own!

266
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,590
Moon Walk!

267
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,250
Why did he bounce back
in the air?! I don't get it!

268
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,010
Why can't I cut him with Tempest Kick?
There's something weird about his body!

269
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,920
What...

270
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,970
...the hell...

271
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,860
...are you?!

272
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,190
Octopu-shoes... Octopu-shoes...

273
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,660
Long-nose!

274
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,700
Why are you here?!

275
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,300
I was--

276
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,360
We had a dream that day

277
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,150
Our belief in ourselves

278
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:47,090
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

279
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:56,640
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

280
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:06,820
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

281
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:15,480
In the end, we can all surely smile

282
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
What the hell's up with your body?

283
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,220
Well, I guess I'm probably the only
guy who can chill cola in his belly.

284
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,800
I knew it! You aren't human!

285
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,750
But I found your weak point!

286
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,790
Hey, hey, buddy. Don't be silly!

287
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm invincible!

288
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,110
"Rooftop Duel! Franky vs. Nero"

290
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
