2
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,190
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,190
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

7
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

10
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,250
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,250
The word "thank you" has faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,420
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,420
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:18,090
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:18,090
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,430
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,430
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's go

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,850
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,150
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,150
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,490
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,490
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,950
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,950
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to lose something precious

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,300
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,300
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,730
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,730
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,030
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,030
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,870
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,870
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,420
Because I don't want to lose something precious

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,720
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,720
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,700
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,240
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,550
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,340
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

58
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,860
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,010
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ to rescue his brother, Ace,

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,570
who is waiting to be executed.

62
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
Ace.

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,570
The execution is in 3 hours.

64
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,170
All forces of the Navy are expecting an attack by the Whitebeard Pirates at Marineford.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,090
Ace, tell them the name of your father.

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,260
My father is Whitebeard.

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,380
No!

68
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,310
Your mother's name is Portgaz D. Rouge.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,250
A year and 3 months after the father's death,

70
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,360
the child was born with the blood of the world's most heinous man in his veins.

71
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,070
That was you!

72
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,030
Your father is...

73
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,790
...the King of the Pirates -

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,210
Gold Roger!

75
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,420
Does it continue?

76
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,470
Still?

77
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,540
The bloodline of the King of the Pirates?!

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,010
"A Vast Fleet Appears! Here Come the Whitebeard Pirates!"

79
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,040
I can't believe that the arch villain had a kid!

80
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,920
The legend of Gold Roger continues!

81
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,710
I'm so relieved that they got him!

82
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,630
If he's a son of the King of the Pirates, he must be atrocious!

83
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,640
If I'd caught him and put him up for auction, I would have made a fortune!

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,190
This execution is turning into quite a show!

85
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,440
So the strength of "Fire Fist" is in his blood.

86
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,610
Then, he has the One Piece, too?

87
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,390
"Fire Fist" is as good as dead anyway.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,530
He will be wiped off the face of the earth soon.

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,090
"Navy"

90
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,770
He is not the biological brother of Luffy, then?

91
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,830
Roger's...

92
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,950
...Son?

93
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,170
His biological son alive! This must be a miracle!

94
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,230
All people connected to Roger should have been executed at that time!

95
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,800
Since his brother is Luffy-san, I thought that his father was Dragon, too!

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,600
I thought so, too! What's the deal here? They're not biological brothers?

97
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,220
Garp.

98
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,000
Garp.

99
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,110
Can you believe this, Garp?

100
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,780
I'm expecting a baby.

101
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,910
Unfortunately, I won't be around by the time of the child's birth.

102
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,830
Why're you telling that to me a Navy officer, Roger?

103
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,710
The mother of the child--a woman related to you will be executed for sure!

104
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,510
That's why I'm telling you.

105
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,690
The Government will definitely dig up my whereabouts for the last year

106
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,400
and find and kill her.

107
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,000
But they can't blame a child whose not born.

108
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,240
Garp!

109
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,870
We've tried to kill each other dozens of times.

110
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,340
That's why I can trust you as I trust my friends.

111
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,220
You must protect my baby.

112
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,310
Stop being so selfish!

113
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,980
No, I'm sure that you'll do it!

114
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,950
Look after my child!

115
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,080
You sure that it's this island?

116
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,580
People saw Roger acting like he wasn't a pirate here.

117
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,750
As if he were a father.

118
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:16,050
Roger's era has ended. We have to cut the bloodline.

119
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,140
Find all the babies who are due within 10 months of his going to jail.

120
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,850
All pregnant women, too.

121
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,440
Kill all mothers who are suspicious.

122
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,950
5 were born in this month.

123
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,880
Ones who are due next month are...

124
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,850
Not yet.

125
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,670
Look into the ones with husbands, too. They could be fake.

126
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,370
She'll come back when she is cleared.

127
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,000
No. Not yet.

128
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,550
You can't come out yet.

129
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,350
I'm sorry.

130
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,770
Not yet.

131
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,860
Not yet.

132
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,620
Not yet.

133
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,450
Not yet. Not yet.

134
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,860
Not yet.

135
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,590
There're no more pregnant women.

136
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,370
It's been 10 months since Roger went to jail. I think he has not child.

137
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,010
So Roger's time is really over, huh?

138
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,330
Stop!

139
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,030
You're Portgaz D. Rouge, aren't you?

140
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,310
If it's a girl--Ann.

141
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,470
If it's a boy--Ace.

142
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,160
Those are the names that he picked.

143
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,240
So his name is Gol D. Ace.

144
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,960
Our son.

145
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,160
Ace.

146
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,970
--Rouge!
--Rouge! Stay with us!

147
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,990
You must raise him, Dadan!

148
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,780
No way!

149
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,900
Whose baby is this?

150
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,680
Dadan?!

151
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,100
Yes. You're gonna live with them from today.

152
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,070
No!

153
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,820
You gotta live with them! Be nice to them!

154
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,620
Because Luffy and I unfortunately have the blood of...

155
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,410
...the world's most infamous criminals in our veins anyway.

156
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,290
I took over the name "Portgaz" from my mother to whom I owe so much

157
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,670
but I never wanted to have my good-for-nothing father's blood.

158
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,960
Old man...

159
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,550
My only father is...

160
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,100
Whitebeard!

161
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,900
Garp.

162
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,980
It was 2 years ago.

163
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,930
You took over your mother's name and rose up in the world of the sea...

164
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,990
...as the captain of the Spade Pirates with your exquisite speed and power.

165
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,050
And that's when we noticed...

166
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,990
...that Roger's blood still flowed!

167
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,300
But Whitebeard also noticed that at the same time.

168
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,560
And to make you the next King of the Pirates,

169
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,600
he let the son of his old rival onto his ship.

170
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,600
No!

171
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,610
I got on the ship to make my dad the next King!

172
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,110
No one believes that except you.

173
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,330
In fact, it made it harder for us to catch you.

174
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,520
You were protected by Whitebeard.

175
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:05,520
If we let you go free, we know you'll use
your abilities to become the next King.

176
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,250
That's why it means a great deal to execute you here today.

177
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,070
Even if it means risking an all-out war with Whitebeard!

178
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,810
Fleet Admiral Sengoku! I have report!

179
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,490
The Gate of Justice is opening without any order.

180
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,340
And we can't make contact with the control room!

181
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,860
What?!

182
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,460
--It'd be nice if it opened with a hit!
--Oh, like "knock knock"...

183
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,630
You think that's all it'd take?!

184
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,150
It's opening!

185
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,900
What is going on?

186
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,500
The Gate of Justice opens on its own!

187
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,520
The Navy guy told us that they weren't gonna open the gate!

188
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,330
The control room must be in Marineford. Who is doing this?

189
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,170
There we go! A little more!

190
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,880
I know it because...

191
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,800
...out of joy, my blade bones are dancing the lambada!

192
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,870
There! There! There we go, there we go, there we go!

193
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,730
Ca-Captain Buggy, don't tell me...

194
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,770
There we go!

195
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,830
Don't tell me that you're opening it!

196
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,330
Are you a messenger of God?!

197
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,030
Is it true, Buggy?!

198
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,450
No, it's not! What kind of role play is this?!

199
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,090
But seriously. Who is opening it?

200
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,790
Well, maybe God really wants me to become the King of the Pirates!

201
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,800
Who cares! In any case...

202
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,460
...let's go!

203
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,530
It's quiet.

204
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,380
But it's almost unnatural.

205
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,800
Alright, let's do it!

206
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,330
There they come!

207
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,640
Everyone, battle stations!

208
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,610
They appeared so suddenly! Where did they get in?

209
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,500
It's the vast fleet of pirate ships!

210
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,550
Where's Whitebeard? Look for him!

211
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,470
Bohemian Knight Doma!

212
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,300
"Thunder Lord" McGuy!

213
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,640
DeCalvan Brothers!

214
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,890
Whirl Spider Squad!

215
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,060
They're all big-time captains who are well known in the New World!

216
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,220
43 ships in total! We can't find Whitebeard or the commanders!

217
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,660
But they're all allies of Whitebeard!

218
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,280
Ace-chan, can you see us?

219
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,620
We're here for you, Ace!

220
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,830
Don't panic! So pathetic!

221
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,170
I didn't expect them to come!

222
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,650
--Shall we attack?
--Not yet.

223
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,300
Whitebeard should be somewhere near, too.

224
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,940
And he must be up to something so keep an eye on the sea!

225
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,890
This is fun!

226
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,940
I'm getting excited! Just come on, Whitebeard!

227
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,750
No way!

228
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,190
Where is he?

229
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,720
I think he'll appear from where we least expect.

230
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,470
Maybe we got the wrong lineup.

231
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,530
--I see a shadow in the bay!
--No way!

232
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,480
I get it now! They got all their ships...

233
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,170
...coated and approached from underwater!

234
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,110
Here comes Moby Dick!

235
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,410
The Moby Dick emerges right in the middle of Marineford.

236
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,760
On its deck, Whitebeard and his 14 commanders are ready for battle.

237
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,680
The Whitebeard Pirates head straight for Ace.

238
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,560
There is an unbroken bond between them an Ace, a family bond!

239
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

240
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,190
"The Beginning of the War! Ace and Whitebeard's Past!"

241
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,330
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
