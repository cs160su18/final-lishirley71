2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,020
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,790
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,170
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,360
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,460
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,310
That's right. You are the man
who stole one of my dreams!

48
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,770
Who the hell are you...?!

49
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,200
I put a lot of thought into my dream!

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,590
If I ate the fruit, I'd use my abilities
to watch women bathe!

51
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,200
No! Just think of all the things I could
use it for. I could... watch women bathe!

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,790
No, Just imagine how I could help others.
I could... watch women bathe!

53
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,950
Phantom Hand!

54
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,080
Phantom Leg!

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,750
I'm not about to let go, you sick beast!

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,130
If you're a mix of a bunch of animals,
I bet you'll make lovely mincemeat!

57
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,010
Extra Haché!

58
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,130
Your lack of experience is going
to make you humiliate yourself

59
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,480
when you underestimate others, greenhorn.

60
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,910
You jerk! Now I'm ticked!

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,120
Gum-Gum...

62
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,750
Why did you jump over the rail?
Trying to run away?

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,080
...Stamp!

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,510
That hurt, brat!

65
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,890
Take that! So much for me not being
able to touch you, Giant Shallot!

66
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,640
Now then, I think I might teach
that Horo-Horo Chick a lesson,

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,350
since she's weaker than me!

68
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,900
Huh? Where did she go?

69
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,590
Over here, Mr. Negative Nose.

70
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,960
Huh? I don't see you.

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,160
Could she be outside?

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,950
No, she couldn't be out there...

73
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,950
We're up on a really high fl--whoa!

74
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,950
I just figured out how
I'm going to take you down.

75
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,720
Once I knock you off,
the others will be easy pickings!

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,850
Wait a sec! This is not what I was expecting!

77
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,760
"Save Me, Hero!! My Enemy
Is the Immortal Princess!"

78
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,600
That stinking hurt! You're going
to regret that, Straw Hat!

79
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,320
Stuff it! I'll kick your butt
as many times as it takes.

80
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,660
Gum-Gum...

81
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,740
...Stamp!

82
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,160
Why, you--! Get off of me!

83
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,720
Your wish is my command. Brick Bat!

84
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,260
Not again!

85
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,350
Gum-Gum Finger Net!

86
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,820
There's no end to this!

87
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,510
Why... are you... flying in the sky?

88
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,810
This doesn't make any sense!

89
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,420
Just a minute ago, she was running
like her life depended on it.

90
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,770
Where'd all this confidence come from?

91
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,120
You merely caught me by surprise back there.

92
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,670
Why?! Why aren't you falling to your knees?!

93
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,380
I've always been negative!

94
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,220
What?!

95
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,240
It never occurred to me that someone
might be immune to my Negative Ghosts.

96
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,020
I have just one thing to say to you.

97
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,460
There are plenty of good things in life!

98
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,530
Drop it!

99
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,280
So what if you can fly?!

100
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,040
I'm a sniper! I don't care if you
can fly or dance or whatever!

101
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,340
Allow me to explain.

102
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,100
My new weapon, Kabuto,

103
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,300
has greater stability and range
thanks to these five prongs.

104
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,150
If I activate the Breath Dials I got
at the sky island when I shoot,

105
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,730
the rotation of my ammo changes,
creating different effects!

106
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,220
It's like a super Pachinko!

107
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,270
Flame! Flash! Impact!

108
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,190
By changing the Dials, my ammo
can grow even more powerful!

109
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,900
No one can escape this puppy!

110
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,950
Now say your pray--

111
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,630
She's gone!

112
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,030
Huh? Where'd she go?

113
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,910
I'm behind you.

114
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,750
Go ahead and take your best shot.

115
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,760
Ehhh?!

116
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,090
Wh-What in the world are you?!

117
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,870
Why, you...!

118
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,850
Special Attack! Swallowtail Meteor!

119
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,440
Gah! Sh-She reverted to her original size!

120
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,500
Whoa!

121
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,610
You little...! I'm gonna shoot you down!

122
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,450
Mantis Meteor!

123
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,660
What's the problem?
Didn't you have perfect aim?

124
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,040
Darn it!

125
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,170
Take this! And this, dammit!

126
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,760
Eat this! Mantis! Swallowtail!
Dragonfly! Mayfly Meteor!

127
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,270
No!

128
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,730
Y-Your hands...!

129
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,240
Your hands sunk into my body!

130
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,470
I-I've been stabbed!

131
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,900
Y-You stabbed me with your bare hands!

132
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm finished...! I'm gonna...!

133
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,170
I'm dead meat! I'm gonna die from blood loss!

134
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,560
Stupid! Take a better look.

135
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,600
I haven't hurt you, but my
hands are inside your body.

136
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,820
Do you know what this means?

137
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,440
It's true that you're about to die.

138
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:32,670
Let me tell you why. I'm just about to
crush your heart with my own two hands.

139
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,950
Don't! Please don't crush it!

140
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,170
I'll die for real!

141
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,880
I'm going to kill you.

142
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,510
Now writhe in agony as you die!

143
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,530
No! Please stop it! I don't wanna die!

144
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,290
Not that I can actually do that!

145
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,370
That was a bluff?!

146
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,980
Ouch! I hit my head!

147
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,730
If I had the physical ability to crush your heart,

148
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,590
you would have died the moment
my hands pierced through your body.

149
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,300
Either way, that was bad for my heart!

150
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,440
I merely passed through...

151
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,400
...your body.

152
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,150
No!

153
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,700
Even though you can clearly see me...

154
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,120
...my body can pass through anything.

155
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,590
Special Attack! Six Chamber Viper Star!

156
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,950
Didn't I just say I can go through anything?

157
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,220
Stop it! This is creepy!

158
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,070
In other words, your attacks can't touch me.

159
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,260
Why, you--! Get away from me!

160
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,410
Shoo, darn it! You stupid little...!

161
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,630
Now what are you going to do?
None of your attacks will work on me.

162
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,340
Shut up! A second ago, you bluffed
that you could crush my heart!

163
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,430
I bet you couldn't touch me if you wanted to!

164
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,230
I can't attack you, but you can't
attack me, either! Isn't that right?

165
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,120
Mini-Hollow...

166
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,240
Wh-What are those...?

167
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,580
Ghost Rap.

168
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,860
A-A shock wave?

169
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,160
Get away from me!

170
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,790
Don't touch me! Get it off of me!
Get it off, meanie!

171
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,850
Rap.

172
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,280
Okay...! Special Attack! Firebird Star!

173
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,010
Shoot!

174
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not fair!

175
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,500
How come she can attack me
when I can't attack her?!

176
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
How is this even a fight?!

177
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,970
Whoa! Get outta my way!

178
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,930
I can't see where I'm going! Move it!

179
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,140
Move!!

180
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,320
Ghost Rap.

181
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,990
Where did he go?

182
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm done going easy on him.

183
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,960
Ghost Rap.

184
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,360
What the heck? Why am I failing so hard?

185
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,700
And here... I thought that
woman was weaker than me!

186
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,200
Tada!

187
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,960
The bear!

188
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,840
Careful, there. Kumacy is
stronger than a real bear.

189
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,810
What gives?!

190
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:21,180
I was so excited when I was
the only one in my entire crew...

191
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,930
...who stood a fighting chance
against this chick's powers!

192
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,980
You guys--your abilities--
are powerless before this chick.

193
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,030
I'll take her on!

194
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,690
This is my chance to shine!

195
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,470
After a declaration like that,
how could I end up like this?

196
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,450
I'm screwed... This is the end!
There is no way I can beat her!

197
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,480
That woman's gonna kill me and then
she's gonna catch Luffy and the guys.

198
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,440
Our crew is doomed!

199
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,870
The weight of saving everyone was...
too great for me to bear.

200
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,140
Save me!

201
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,160
Save me, Sogeking!

202
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,130
Please tell me! How would you handle this?

203
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,590
I was born on the island of snipers

204
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,220
Kumacy!

205
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,970
Stomp!

206
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,040
I never miss my mark

207
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,330
Monster! How dare you purify my Kumacy?!

208
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,380
Lulu lala lu

209
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,990
And what's with that goofy mask?!

210
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,690
Whether it's a mouse's eyeball, lock on!!

211
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:12,620
Or even your heart, lock on!!

212
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,820
It is hardly goofy!

213
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,740
It is a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Sogeking.

214
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:19,650
The man who hails from the island of snipers

215
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,570
You're totally goofing off!
You aren't a different person!

216
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,730
Time to flee!

217
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,340
You're making a run for it?!

218
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,170
Lululu, lulu lala

219
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:25,640
You bet I am! I'm not sticking
around for this crazy fight!

220
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,820
Now... run away!

221
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,270
I use my negative outlook and
bluffs to get through fights!

222
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,690
Sogege, soge, soge

223
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,010
I never thought someone
would use those against me!

224
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:38,110
Sogeking!

225
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,110
Are you okay with this?

226
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,110
Calm yourself! Face her and fight, Usopp-kun!

227
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,580
Shut up! I've had it!

228
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
There is no way I can beat her!

229
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,300
That is not true! You are a very capable man!

230
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,080
Can you prove that?

231
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,460
--No!
--You can't?!

232
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,240
Mini-Hollow!

233
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,300
But think carefully! There are
several oddities about that woman.

234
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,280
Yeah, you have a point.

235
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,180
Like how she suddenly got really confident!

236
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,560
At first, she was definitely
running away in fear of me.

237
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,780
If my attacks were ineffective from
the start, she didn't need to flee.

238
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,660
She should have been able
to pass through walls and fly!

239
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,200
But all she did back then
was whine while she ran.

240
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,450
Why was she so negative?

241
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,410
That's it!

242
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,290
Rap. Rap!

243
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,960
The change occurred after I lost sight of her!

244
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,390
Something must have happened!

245
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,470
Remember...

246
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:14,550
What happened during the brief moment
that bear stalled me and I lost sight of her...?

247
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,380
What happened?

248
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,970
Well, I guess it's about time
I handed you over to Moria-sama.

249
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,850
That's it! I've solved the puzzle!

250
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,600
Are there any hiding spots nearby?

251
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,200
Like a hidden room...?

252
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,620
A room!

253
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,250
Your trick...!

254
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,090
What is it? Are these your final words?

255
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,090
Wait! Where do you think you're aiming?!

256
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,060
That's it!

257
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,680
--Hey, wait!
--Special Attack! Atlas Comet!

258
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,150
I found it!

259
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,110
That is your real body.

260
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,130
Usopp Eye can find any opponent's weakness!

261
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,050
Usopp Weapon has defeated
multiple formidable foes!

262
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:36,390
And Usopp Brain can devise awesome strategies
to pull me out of any sticky situation!

263
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,180
If you take me lightly, you'll get hurt.

264
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

265
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,520
"Perona Is Terrified!!
Usopp and Untruthful Share the Same 'U'"

266
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
