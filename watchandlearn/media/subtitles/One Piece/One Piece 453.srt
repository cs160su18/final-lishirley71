2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,260
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,660
Luffy has broken out of the
great prison - Impel Down

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,800
in order to rescue his brother, Ace!--

52
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,750
No! I know that you guys know about the
war between Whitebeard and the Navy!

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,000
--What'd you say?
--The Navy HQ?

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,630
We passed through the Gate of Justice.

55
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,030
That means our destination must be
either the Navy HQ or Enies Lobby.

56
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,660
The Tub Current that we're on
is exclusive to the Government.

57
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,010
It's a giant whirlpool that connects
the Government's 3 major facilities

58
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,930
We didn't know about this!

59
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,160
Buggy! Buggy!

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,530
Be quiet, you flashy fools!

61
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,770
You guys are all full of whim and fancy!

62
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,700
If you guys are real men, why don't
you live out a dream with me?!

63
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,830
Today...

64
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,660
I'll beat Whitebeard which means
that I'll conquer the world!

65
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,630
--I will follow you!
--I don't want a peaceful life!

66
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,800
That's right!

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,220
Let's go, guys! To Navy Headquarters!

68
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,640
Looks like it's over.

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,780
I hope they are having fun.

70
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,130
"The Friends' Whereabouts! The Weatheria
Report and the Cyborg Animals!"

71
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,340
I know that you are worried about Ace-san

72
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,040
but you need to take some rest.

73
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,400
The war that we are about to get involved in
is literally the decisive battle of our times!

74
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,370
Just as Impel Down is the
greatest prison in the world,

75
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,950
the Navy Headquarters is the
greatest fortress in the world!

76
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,160
Meanwhile, a short time ago at
the small Sky Island - Weatheria,

77
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,320
home to scientists who study the weather.

78
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,640
Hey, hey, hey, young girl!

79
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey! Hey, young girl!

80
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,190
Hey! Hey!

81
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,650
Alright! What do you want?!

82
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,240
H-Hey, what's this?!

83
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,660
Do you like the taste of my cloud
candy? I've been working on it.

84
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,920
It was so hard to make it
taste like cotton candy.

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,460
What do you think?

86
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,860
Are you trying to kill me?!

87
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,430
Wait a minute, young girl! Violence won't do!

88
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,430
Honestly!

89
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,110
Oh, it's sweet! It does
taste like cotton candy!

90
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,020
That's what I thought!

91
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,110
Hm... So I guess that this island
is really full of wonder!

92
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,870
Oh, by the way, are you sure that we're
heading to the Sabaody Archipelago?!

93
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,290
Yes, I'm doing it for you as a special favor!

94
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,910
But it's been a while since I asked you.

95
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,720
When are we gonna get there?

96
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,350
What do you mean?

97
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,140
Huh?

98
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,100
Wasn't I clear enough?!

99
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,980
Weatheria travels on the wind.

100
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,820
If a
typhoon comes, it's gonna be really fast.

101
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,150
How far did we get yesterday?

102
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,850
Probably about 200 meters.

103
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,000
Honestly, if this weren't a Sky
Island, I would've left already!

104
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,280
But we're still too far away from the
Sabaody if you were to go down on the ground now.

105
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,670
If you stay here, we'll get there someday.

106
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,760
Look, I don't have that much time to spare.

107
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,710
Then, shall we go down?

108
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,680
I'm running out of research funds anyway.

109
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,850
Huh?

110
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,150
What do you mean "go down?"

111
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,270
I mean, on the ground.

112
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,690
Is that possible?!

113
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,330
You know, it takes a lot of
money to do this research.

114
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,790
So I go down from time to time to do some
business with my knowledge of the weather.

115
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,880
What is this?!

116
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,620
Young girl!

117
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,900
It's this way!

118
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,940
A ship?!

119
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,240
Wow, this ship... floats in the sky?!

120
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,500
No!

121
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,710
Let's go!

122
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,840
What?!

123
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,110
That's just the island
that I was looking for!

124
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,410
This island is...

125
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,710
...terrible!

126
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,580
Did you say that you can save this island?!

127
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,210
Yes.

128
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,130
It seems like you people are
in need of blessed rain.

129
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,050
I can make it rain with my
knowledge of the weather!

130
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,010
What did you just say?!

131
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,290
I can do this now for a special price...

132
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,940
...of 100 million berries!

133
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,710
100 million?!

134
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,900
I'm afraid we don't have that much money.

135
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,050
Is it too much?!

136
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,440
That's way too much!
No one can afford that!

137
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,170
Well...

138
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,590
--Then, 100 berries!
--Huh?!

139
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,380
What a deal!

140
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,960
You came down too much! You
have no sense for business!

141
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,220
Relax!

142
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,720
That aside, can you really do it?
Weren't you being too optimistic?

143
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,730
Believe in my knowledge of
the weather! Okay, ready?

144
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,820
Those are..

145
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,200
...soap bubbles!

146
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,870
There's something inside.

147
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,330
Young girl, could you generate
some wind with this?!

148
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,210
Oh, this is...

149
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,130
Do you want it full power?!

150
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,590
Yes!

151
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,620
Oh my god! I can't believe this!

152
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,850
--It's raining!
--Yeah!

153
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,740
We did it!

154
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,120
They're so pleased!

155
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Yeah! Now, don't you think the
science of weather is useful?

156
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,680
Okay. So I guess this is
goodbye, right? Young girl.

157
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,920
I already asked the mayor

158
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,520
so he'll provide
you with what you need for your journey.

159
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,810
--I'm not going!
--What?

160
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,660
I'll stay with you.

161
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,650
I've become interested
in the science of weather a bit.

162
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,200
Really?

163
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,530
Can you teach me about it on our
way to the Sabaody Archipelago?

164
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,330
Of course!

165
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,870
You sure? Thank you!

166
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,000
Anyone who loves the weather is welcomed!

167
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,580
Is this from before? This is perfect!

168
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,680
Let me tell you about this soap
bubble with the thundercloud inside.

169
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,060
Oh no, this is not good!

170
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,600
Huh?

171
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,200
You...

172
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,560
What're you doing?!

173
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,720
S-S-Science exacts a price!

174
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,110
Am I the price?!

175
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,000
Help... Help me!

176
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,390
Meanwhile, on the Mechanical Island -

177
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,710
Future Land Baldimore, the
birthplace of the Genius.

178
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,570
It makes me super relaxed!

179
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,480
Oh no!

180
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,420
He was way funnier before!

181
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,890
Oh! What do you think we can
do to turn Franky back?!

182
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,770
The cola hasn't arrived yet so
we can't conduct an operation.

183
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,360
He has to take back his perversion...

184
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,070
I mean, wildness, in order to
get back to being himself again.

185
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,780
Wildness?

186
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,890
It's cold!

187
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,980
How did I get here?

188
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,810
Here is a scarf!

189
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,030
Oh?

190
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,660
What is going on here?!

191
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,750
"Keep Out?"

192
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,500
"This is an enclosed forest
of mechanical animals?"

193
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,120
Mission: The surprising
wake-up in the jungle!

194
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,420
Take back your wildness
through surviving, old man!

195
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,920
Don't try this at home, kids!

196
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,180
Hey guys, you better relax!

197
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,770
You all seem very frustrated.
Have you eaten breakfast?

198
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,270
It is not good for your mental health
if you don't eat it every day!

199
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,920
Oh I see! This is breakfast time!

200
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,790
What was I thinking?

201
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,410
Delicious! There is nothing like the
first cup of tea in the morning!

202
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,750
Do you guys want some?

203
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,720
It feels great to be alive!

204
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,050
It's not working!

205
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,170
Help us!

206
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,970
Good morning, boys!

207
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,430
Old man!

208
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,890
I'm not an old man! Call me Mr. Frank!

209
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,900
Violence is not...

210
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,480
I know you are at an age
when you want to be naughty...

211
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,360
If you let me talk...

212
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,070
You'll see...

213
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,820
Let's sort this out...

214
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,200
...in a gentlemanly manner!

215
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,330
Stop... Nothing good... comes... from war!

216
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,230
Mr. Frank!

217
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,170
Oh no, it's not working at all!

218
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,590
Relax...

219
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,670
Listen to what I say... Listen to what...

220
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,220
Listen to... Listen...

221
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,220
Lis...

222
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,930
To...

223
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,390
Listen... Lis... L...

224
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,680
Lis...

225
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,050
Super!

226
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,060
Who do you think I am?!

227
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,890
I am Franky-sama!

228
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,110
Yeah! You're back, old man!

229
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,320
Per... vert!

230
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,620
What's the matter?

231
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,410
I got cooled down a little
so I'm running out of steam!

232
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,690
Oh, geek! I mean, god!

233
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,950
Um... Um...

234
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,620
Oh yeah! We gotta go there!

235
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,240
Where are we going?

236
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,500
The house of Dr. Vegapunk!

237
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,630
Maybe we can find a machine
to make some cola!

238
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,050
Dr. Vegapunk?!

239
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,000
He's the standout genius

240
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,900
of Future Land
Baldimore known for its advanced technology!

241
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,810
The mechanical animals that you just
saw are all cyborgs that he created!

242
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,170
I heard that he was a weirdo and he
left the island with cyborgs running wild

243
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,660
but that he was also amazing!

244
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,230
Grandpa told me to keep away from here

245
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,090
because there are a lot of
dangerous creations inside!

246
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,810
Alright!

247
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,990
What the hell is this?!

248
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,520
Sanji is on the run from countless
pursuers of ambiguous gender.

249
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,910
After running and running to escape them,

250
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,440
he's met by a mysterious
queen, and a frilly dress.

251
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,850
Around that time,

252
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,890
a huge, round creature falls
to the ground behind Chopper!

253
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,280
On the next episode of One Piece!

254
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,360
"The Friends' Whereabouts! A Cheeper
of Giant Birds and a Pink Showdown!"

255
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,860
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
