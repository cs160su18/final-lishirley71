2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,330
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,180
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,320
Seeking a ship-coating craftsman

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,970
to help them reach the
deep-sea Fish-Man Island,

52
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,660
the Straw Hat crew landed
on the Sabaody Archipelago,

53
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,480
where they met Rayleigh, a skilled craftsman

54
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
and the former vice-captain
of the Roger Pirates.

55
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,610
Luffy and company decided to hide
until Rayleigh finished the coating

56
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,240
when suddenly a cyborg with
Bartholomew Kuma's body appeared!

57
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,190
Diamble Jambe!

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,760
Flambé Shot!

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,850
Demon Aura Kyutoryu!

60
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,510
Asura's Nine Lightning Slashes!

61
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,560
Gear Third!

62
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,030
Gigant Rifle!

63
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,340
Let's rest a little...

64
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,370
I didn't expect it to turn into
such an all-out fight so suddenly...

65
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,470
However, Sentomaru,
head of the Navy Science Unit,

66
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,630
blocked their way,
accompanied by yet another Pacifista.

67
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,430
Let's get away from here!

68
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,240
But not all together!
We'll split up in groups!

69
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,490
They're splitting up! After them, PX-1!

70
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Gum-Gum...

71
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,110
...Gatling!

72
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,490
Hoisa!

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,790
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

74
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,870
Zoro!

75
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,460
Wh-What?! Who are you?!

76
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,480
Get away! Get away from Zoro, you dumbass!

77
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,230
Z-Z-Zoro-san!

78
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,850
Zoro-san's been hit by a beam!

79
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,230
Kizaru?!

80
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,800
Navy Admiral Kizaru also appeared,

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,480
and the crew found itself in an
extraordinarily desperate situation.

82
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,600
"Admiral Kizaru's Fierce Assault
The Straw Hats Face Certain Death!"

83
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,620
Here it comes!

84
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,780
H-He got me...

85
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,650
Hey, you, damn Warlord of the Sea!

86
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,940
Bring it on!

87
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,380
This time, I will kick the crap outta you!

88
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,500
Kid!

89
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,360
Repel!

90
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,250
No one's ever been hit by
that and gotten up afterward!

91
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,340
We just took down one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea!

92
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,010
This is the extent of
Bartholomew Kuma's strength?

93
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,020
What?!

94
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,240
This thing's a machine?! A cyborg?!

95
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,550
Why the hell did you do that?!

96
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,830
You place too much confidence
in your techniques, Eustass-ya.

97
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,520
What?!

98
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,940
Do you honestly think
this is a Warlord of the Sea?

99
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,890
What do you mean?

100
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,930
Our next guests have arrived.

101
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,970
We can talk later.

102
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,270
Charge!

103
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,160
A polar bear?!

104
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,140
Hey, you...!

105
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,790
Hey, Trafalgar.
About what you said earlier...

106
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,430
If he ain't a Warlord, then what is he?

107
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,720
Now what?!

108
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,670
Zoro!

109
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,480
Hey! He shoots beams, too!
This ain't good! Do something!

110
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,990
At that distance, the beams'll kill him!

111
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,860
Oh no! Zoro's in trouble!

112
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,250
Usopp!

113
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,210
H-Hey, you! Stop that!

114
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:29,960
Take this!

115
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,550
Take this!

116
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,180
Damn! What's going on?! Why can't I hit him?

117
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,810
I-I can't even stab him!
Hold on! What should we do?!

118
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,850
Take this! Dammit!

119
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,950
Move your foot!

120
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,830
Move it aside!

121
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,730
It's no use;

122
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,390
I ate the Glint-Glint Fruit, you see.

123
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,610
I'm made of light. I'm a Logia.

124
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,750
Made of light?!

125
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,050
This can't be for real! He's going to die!

126
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,000
Zoro! Run!

127
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,540
Zoro!

128
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,930
My body's... at it's...

129
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,220
It's no good! The bastard's at his limit now!

130
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,140
Veinte Fleurs!

131
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,810
All right! Way to go, Robin!

132
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,140
He just instantly...!

133
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,040
How did he do that?!

134
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,570
I won't let you move, either.

135
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,080
It's no use.

136
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,100
Now you will die.

137
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,780
You're getting involved in this...

138
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,920
...Dark King Rayleigh?!

139
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,380
Don't be plucking these young sprouts!

140
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,820
Their era is just about to begin!

141
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,060
Old guy!

142
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,670
He's saved!

143
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,680
Thank goodness!

144
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,480
The "Dark King"? Him?!

145
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,400
I'd heard on occasion that
you were on these islands.

146
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,760
I guess those reports were true.

147
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,810
Are you defending these chicklings
because you're still a pirate

148
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,890
even if you aren't what you
once were, Rayleigh-san?

149
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,590
I would be able to retire freely and peacefully

150
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,870
if you people would kindly
take down my wanted posters.

151
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,610
The crimes of a pirate cannot just go away.

152
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,030
Especially not those of the Roger Pirates.

153
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,260
But, to capture you,

154
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,060
I would first need to make
some preparations, so...

155
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,360
Wh-What a relief, Zoro!

156
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,730
This guy really is awesome!

157
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,050
Every attack we tried went
right through his body!

158
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,160
How did he stop him just now?!

159
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,540
I don't suppose you could
overlook them, Kizaru-kun?

160
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,280
Give me a break!

161
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,540
If I don't catch these kids,
we at Navy Headquarters

162
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,770
will lose face with the
Celestial Dragons in Marie Jois.

163
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,000
Could I ask you not to get in the way?

164
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,980
Usopp! Brook!

165
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,930
Take Zoro and escape!

166
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,610
Come on! Let's go, Brook!

167
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,480
Right!

168
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,400
Everyone focus on escaping!

169
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,960
As we are now, we can't beat these guys!

170
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,420
How noble! Yet, how annoying...

171
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,660
Franky!

172
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,810
I'm gonna use up all of my cola energy!

173
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,760
This is my final attack!

174
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,930
Coup de Vent!

175
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,140
Try that on for size, you dumbass!

176
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,310
Now run!

177
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,020
Old guy! Thanks!

178
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,310
Yes! I pray for your safety!

179
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,210
Yata Mirror!

180
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,620
I-It's too bright!

181
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,190
Light?! Is he going to do something to us?!

182
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,200
Whoops!

183
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,320
You're not going anywhere!

184
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,120
It's nice to be holding a sword again.

185
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,740
Ama no Murakumo Sword!

186
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,440
Dear me.

187
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,600
And I came to these islands
with such casual intentions too...

188
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,230
Confusion is what life
is all about, Kizaru-kun!

189
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,150
That light from before is gone!

190
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,160
It looks like the old guy saved us again!

191
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,610
Th-Th-That was so frightening!

192
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,960
It would appear he really is the Dark King.

193
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,010
That's the first time I've ever
seen someone stop Uncle.

194
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,490
But we're just about finished with Roronoa,
who's worth over 100 million...

195
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,020
PX-1! Roronoa is barely alive!

196
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,620
Start with him!

197
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,260
He's...!

198
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,720
Franky! Look after Nami-san!

199
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,230
Go on ahead!

200
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,100
Watch yourself, now! We'll be fine!

201
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,190
Sanji-kun?!

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
They're going after Usopp's group!

203
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,140
--Put me down...
--Huh?!

204
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,390
I'm letting you guys get away...!

205
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,200
Don't be stupid!

206
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,060
You're even more useless than me right now!

207
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,820
We're escaping together!

208
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,460
That's what Luffy decided!

209
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,890
I-It couldn't be!

210
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,740
It's coming!

211
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,980
Usopp-san!

212
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,490
Usopp-san! Please, go on ahead!

213
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,510
Don't, Brook! You know how strong he is!

214
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,460
Quickly!

215
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,030
All for one! One for all!

216
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,790
Sometimes a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do!

217
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,190
That was in vain, no bones about it...

218
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,790
Brook!

219
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,510
I mean, waaah!

220
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,240
Stay away!

221
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,950
Stop, you damn bastard!

222
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,970
Sanji!

223
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,340
My leg!

224
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,920
Run, Sanji! He's aiming at you!

225
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,800
You idiot! Get outta here!

226
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,700
My subordinates are quite
powerful too, I must say...

227
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,170
Zoro! I'm sorry!

228
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,170
I dropped you! You alright?!

229
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,930
Hold it, you damn bastard...!

230
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,840
Damn it...!

231
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,430
Stop!

232
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,980
Zoro...

233
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,040
It looks like they're in trouble there!

234
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
There's no need to even use my battle axe!

235
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,860
And I'm pretty sure you don't have
time to worry about your friends!

236
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,570
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

237
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,020
Luffy!

238
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,540
Luffy's made of rubber!
Why do his body blows work on him?!

239
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,810
Darn it!

240
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,900
Chopper! Don't stop!

241
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,700
Sanji!

242
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,200
Sanji!

243
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,990
Darn it! Everyone's being beaten!

244
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,110
No, Chopper!

245
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,450
All of you quit it!

246
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,570
Rumble!

247
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,340
Chopper!

248
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,360
That's that thing from before!

249
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,780
What is this?

250
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,730
I'd heard about this, but...!

251
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,890
That's an interesting power you got,

252
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,820
but it appears you don't
have control over it.

253
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,660
Luffy! Look out!

254
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,680
Chopper went and did that again?!

255
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,870
I dunno what's going on, but he's distracted!

256
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,020
Now's our chance!

257
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,700
Sanji! Brook! Get up!

258
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,690
Now's our chance to get away from here!

259
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,550
Hurry! Before another beam comes!

260
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,590
Hey! Hurry and get up!

261
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,920
Brook! Sanji!

262
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,510
Wait, PX-1.

263
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,870
Now there's another one!

264
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,950
Wh-What in the world's going on?!

265
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
I've had enough!

266
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,370
Just how many of these guys are there?!

267
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,050
This one's...

268
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,810
...the real deal!

269
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,100
What happened here?!

270
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,870
N...

271
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,650
Nothing... at all...!

272
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,930
So, you're still alive, Roronoa...

273
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,750
Thanks to... your mercy...

274
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,730
H-Hold on, Zoro!

275
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,180
This is no time to be talking! Hurry and...!

276
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,110
If you were to take a trip,
where would you want to go?

277
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,060
Come on, Zoro!

278
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,810
We gotta get outta here, quick!

279
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,610
Huh?!

280
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,130
Where's Zoro?!

281
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,630
Zoro-san...?

282
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,270
Zoro?! Zoro?! Zoro!

283
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,090
What happened...?!

284
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,570
Zoro...?!

285
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
Zoro...

286
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,140
disappeared!

287
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,130
Everyone's been erased.

288
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,590
Brook... Franky...

289
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,640
Robin... Chopper...

290
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,740
Sanji... Usopp...

291
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,560
Nami... Zoro...

292
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,980
Why can't I save even one of my friends?

293
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,570
On the next episode of One Piece!

294
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,250
"Eliminated Friends --
The Final Day of the Straw Hat Crew"
