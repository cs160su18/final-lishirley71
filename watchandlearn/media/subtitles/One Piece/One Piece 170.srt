2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,740
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,140
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:53,290
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:00,890
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:08,810
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:16,010
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:25,140
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,270
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,150
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,240
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,410
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:52,000
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,440
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,020
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,310
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,650
Nami's group on the Going Merry
headed for the eastern shore

19
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,730
in order to escape from Upper Yard.

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,520
Meanwhile, Shandians headed
for God's Shrine to defeat Eneru,

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,790
but encountered Priest Shura,

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,250
and a great battle between
him and Wyper took place!

23
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,040
Why would you throw your shield
and gun away?! Are you a fool?!

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,770
No, he wouldn't...!

25
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,730
If you want a shoulder, you can have one.

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,780
An Impact, huh?! Such things can't defeat me!

27
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,120
No, it's ten times the energy.

28
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,000
Reject!

29
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,710
Wyper! Are you trying to die?!

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,580
Try using the Reject Dial one more time!
Your body'll be blown apart!

31
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,100
So what about my body?
Isn't that called "resolve"?

32
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,600
These guys can't be beaten
without any sacrifices like this!

33
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,740
I'm going on ahead!

34
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,280
Fine! Do what you want!

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,620
At least pray for everyone's good luck!

36
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,460
Alright, guys! Watch yourselves out there!

37
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,700
Let's meet at God's Shrine!

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,260
At present, one has dropped out
of the Upper Yard survival game,

39
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,730
and eighty remain!

40
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,360
He must not have had God's divine protection.

41
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,440
Meanwhile, four of the Straw Hats
set out to search for gold.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,900
Their goal: the ruins of an ancient city
where a vast amount of gold rests!

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,470
They head straight south
from the sacrificial altar!

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,390
Straight... south...

45
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,140
"Fierce Midair Battle!
Pirate Zoro vs. Warrior Braham"

46
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,210
--Wait!
--What do you want?!

47
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,260
No, I have nothing to say, nor do I
want to hear any of your garbage.

48
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,940
I simply want to eliminate you!

49
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,540
Oh! That's nice and easy to understand!

50
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,470
The priests and guerillas here all
use strange fighting techniques.

51
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,380
Might be dangerous to use my
swords from the usual distance...

52
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,580
But if I need to defeat enemies
from a distance... I do have that.

53
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,320
Hawk Wave!

54
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,070
The other one might work
against small fries, but...

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,240
Still needs work...

56
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,990
But I guess I'll try it out...

57
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,550
A flying slash!

58
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,070
Shandians!

59
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,600
Divine Soldiers!

60
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,790
I...

61
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,440
...should never have come!

62
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,370
The forest has become quite lively...

63
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,210
This is a house away from the city.

64
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,810
As expected, it's been swallowed by the forest.

65
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,480
I wonder if the ruins of
the actual city are intact...

66
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,970
A woman!

67
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,400
This route leads to God's Shrine!
Going any further would be insolent!

68
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,110
Get down from there!

69
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,680
You don't seem to realize the
historical value that ruins have!

70
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,080
How impudent!

71
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,040
Do you have business with me?
What do you want?

72
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,270
Simple! By God's orders,

73
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,070
I'm to chop the Shandians
and you Blue Sea people

74
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,590
into pieces with this Axe Dial!

75
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,010
Seis Fleurs!

76
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,130
Twist!

77
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,700
Just awful.

78
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,620
That'll teach you, Divine Soldier!

79
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,260
They've killed many of our allies!

80
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,630
Damn! These Divine Soldiers mean trouble!

81
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,630
Right. Right. Right...

82
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,350
Is that one of the Blue Sea
people Wyper mentioned?!

83
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,220
He must be eliminated!

84
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,100
A guerilla!

85
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,230
Seems he wants to fight!

86
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,440
Die!

87
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,400
I dunno what brought this on, but...!

88
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,340
Who the hell are you guys?!

89
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,290
Please, forgive me! I give up!

90
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,200
I give up! I lose! Please don't kill me...!

91
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,460
Another one?!

92
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,350
Hey, you! If you ain't a priest,
don't be attackin' me!

93
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,300
I'm in a hurry here!

94
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,300
Bastard! What the hell
are those flashing pistols?!

95
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,790
Where'd he go?!

96
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,760
You're pretty tough.

97
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,530
I apologize. I underestimated you,
Blue Sea person.

98
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,620
No, I should apologize.

99
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,430
I had you pegged as a small fry.

100
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,910
He didn't even step toward me!

101
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,580
They said there's all kinds of wavers...

102
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,540
Are those skate things just another type?

103
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,840
He's using blasts to make himself float!

104
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,140
And those pistols that flash each time he shoots!

105
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,190
Because of those, I lose sight of him every time!

106
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,260
Where'd he go?!

107
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,570
--Tiger...
--Three swords?!

108
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,080
...Trap!

109
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,330
Bastard!

110
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,860
A Blue Sea swordsman who
can't even use wavers or dials...

111
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,770
Anything you do is useless!

112
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,360
Know what this is?!

113
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,190
What the...?!

114
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,310
A Milky Dial!

115
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,870
Aerial combat ain't just
jumping around desperately!

116
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,780
A-An eel?!

117
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,630
I bet this'd make good eatin', broiled...

118
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,580
I-I really screwed up! Am I an idiot?!

119
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,540
I'm already dealing with a
nimble enough bastard here...

120
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,210
...but then I get my leg shot up!

121
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,010
Isn't there anything I can do
about those flashing pistols?!

122
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,670
That's it!

123
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,020
Those are some mighty nice
weapons you got there!

124
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,640
But too bad! Look! I have goggles!

125
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,260
Your flashing pistols
won't work on me anymore!

126
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,270
So just give it up!

127
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,020
They don't look like sunglasses to me...

128
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,990
He saw through it!

129
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,170
You don't seem fond of these Flash Guns.

130
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,160
Close distance is vital to a swordsman.
You're no match for me.

131
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,090
I don't know what you guys are here for.

132
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,630
But as long as you are here,
you're still our enemy.

133
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,600
Now die already! Your leg
must hurt pretty bad, too.

134
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,350
Mind your own business. It only grazed me.

135
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,490
Getting shot while gawking at
an eel is proof I still lack vigor.

136
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,020
Well then, this is the perfect
situation to try out that technique...

137
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,460
Shall I give it a try?

138
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,010
Trying to run away?

139
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,760
Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind...

140
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,240
Those six roots of man
have good, evil, and peace...

141
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,320
What are you talking about?

142
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,350
And each of those has pure and impure...

143
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,280
36 worldly desires in a lifetime...

144
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,640
I now have the barrel of
a cannon pointed at you.

145
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,420
You have pistols, I have a cannon...

146
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,620
Distance and power-wise,
my weapon is superior.

147
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,800
You've done well...

148
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,900
...but now you die!

149
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,480
A cannon?

150
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,440
Have you gone mad?
Where is this weapon of yours?!

151
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,040
Have you ever seen a flying slash?

152
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,200
Nonsense!

153
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,960
Single-Sword Style!

154
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,650
Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

155
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,650
Sorry.

156
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:16,790
Nothing personal, but I ain't the
type of guy who'll die when told to.

157
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,690
I accept this survival challenge!

158
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,020
Darn it...

159
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,370
I lost all sense of direction...

160
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,580
Guys!

161
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,320
Luffy! Zoro! Robin!

162
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,980
Am I going to be left here to die?

163
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,420
Will I go to heaven if I die?
Will the doctor be waiting for me?

164
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,880
No, I can't think like that!

165
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm a doctor! I can't think
about death so casually!

166
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,100
But I wonder what heaven is like...

167
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,690
Wait, isn't this heaven?

168
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,230
Huh?!

169
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,230
Things turned all ruin-ish at some point.

170
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,430
I wonder if the others are here!
I guess I really am great!

171
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,410
Oh! Could I be the first one here?!
Yeah! My nose must've helped!

172
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,460
Yay! I'm the first!

173
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,920
A raccoon dog...

174
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,100
Gum-Gum...

175
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,930
...Balloon!

176
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,570
That doesn't work on me at all!

177
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,070
Gum-Gum...

178
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,210
...Balloon!

179
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,970
Why, you...

180
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,350
...bastard!

181
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,190
Sanji-kun!

182
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,860
Sanji!

183
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,190
Sanji!

184
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,990
--Sanji-kun!
--H-Hey!

185
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,000
Say something, Sanji!

186
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,420
Hey! What happened?! Sanji!

187
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,830
Hey! I can't hear his heart!

188
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,640
No way!

189
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:41,800
What a foolish man. And I didn't
even come here to bring you harm.

190
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,740
Then why are you here?!

191
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,220
What a cold-hearted hello...

192
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:59,660
It's truly been six long years,
Former God Gan Fall...

193
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,140
Racing full speed ahead as always

194
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,890
A to Z, we run through it

195
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,730
We all have worries and fall many times

196
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,650
But we just need to rise to the top someday

197
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:32,120
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

198
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:40,190
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

199
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,690
I never treat you "bad"

200
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,340
How many times did we fall?

201
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:55,470
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

202
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,990
Smile! Come back to you, friends

203
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,800
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

204
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,730
Come back to you, friends

205
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,560
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

206
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,280
Come back to you, friends

207
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,550
I can't believe Sanji-kun is dead...

208
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,730
Why is it just you and the old
man here?! I can't rely on you!

209
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,080
That's my line!

210
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,350
Straw Hat! I'm going to eliminate you!

211
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,870
It's no use! Your bazooka doesn't work on me!

212
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,850
Wretched pest! Don't mock sky combat!

213
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

214
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,040
"The Roaring Burn Bazooka!!
Luffy vs. War Demon Wyper"

215
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
