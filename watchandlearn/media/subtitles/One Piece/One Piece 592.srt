2
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,130
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,300
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,590
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

9
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

10
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,470
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

11
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,770
After surviving a fierce battle,

12
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,940
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

13
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,190
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

14
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,570
They landed on Punk Hazard;

15
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,100
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen,

16
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,280
and regrouped at Dr. Vegapunk's
former laboratory.

17
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,950
What?! The samurai left?!

18
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,500
--Yes.
--Damn!

19
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,590
When I said I saw a torso earlier,

20
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,300
he asked me where in detail.

21
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,590
Boy, that fool!

22
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,150
Sanji, Brook, and Zoro

23
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,430
headed to the lake looking
for the missing samurai.

24
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,230
What's wrong, Synd?

25
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,790
Are you in pain?

26
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,690
Mocha!

27
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,110
What happened, everybody?!

28
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,090
NHC10.

29
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,990
I detected it in their body.

30
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,160
Although it was just a trace amount, it's...

31
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,200
...a drug!

32
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,910
The candy...

33
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,330
The candy...

34
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,460
Straw Hat bro!

35
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,250
Are you gonna go get me the candy?

36
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,880
No, I can't! If Chopper says "No," I can't!

37
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,590
He is our doctor. Trust him!

38
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,510
You said you're gonna go get it for me!!

39
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,060
Special Attack - Sleep Star!

40
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,820
All right! They are all sleeping now.

41
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,000
Luffy decided to take the
children back to their parents

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,730
and set out looking to find the "Master"

43
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,210
who is responsible for the experiment.

44
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,750
What about Straw Hat-ya's group?

45
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,650
Since Monet told me to be
careful with the Straw Hats,

46
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,330
I sent those two just to make sure.

47
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,630
"To Annihilate the Straw Hats!
Legendary Assassins Descend!"

48
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,420
PUNK HAZARD THE REMAINS OF THE
FIRST AND SECOND LABORATORY

49
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,920
They could come after us at any moment.

50
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,010
So please come back as soon as possible.

51
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,470
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

52
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,150
Control your strength! You're a robot now!

53
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,890
I hope this Master guy will just
come clean about those children.

54
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,600
If he doesn't, I will force him to.

55
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,410
I'll shove my finger into his nose
and make his back teeth rattle!

56
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,780
Franky, please don't talk!

57
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,910
All right! Let's go now!

58
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,640
Good luck!

59
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,860
Take care!

60
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,870
By the way,

61
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,320
why is he sleeping, too?

62
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,220
It's me.

63
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,510
We just took care of three
of them for starters.

64
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,600
What?

65
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,860
Pirate Hunter Zoro.

66
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,290
Cat Burglar.

67
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,640
Soul King.

68
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,110
We left their bodies at the bottom
of the cliff in district F-16.

69
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,740
Can you recover them?

70
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,200
--D-Did you kill them?
--Do you have a problem with that?

71
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,950
W-Well, I mean...

72
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,390
If you don't want them
dead, then don't call us!

73
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,790
No, I'm sorry! The Master
said dead or alive so...

74
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,450
Whoa whoa, don't get so heated up.

75
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,540
Oh, I can't believe I lost it.

76
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,600
Let's stay cool.

77
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,970
We will be counting on you.

78
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,850
CAESAR CLOWN'S LABORATORY

79
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,730
Did you hear that?

80
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,770
Three of them are dead already, Monet!

81
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,470
Yeah?

82
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,080
That's disappointing.

83
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,920
The Straw Hats are a part of the
Worst Generation; as is Law.

84
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,740
The Government is keeping its eye
on them as well as Blackbeard.

85
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,040
And there was a scintillating
newspaper article

86
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,580
with the title "They're Back in Force"

87
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,610
so I thought they were stronger.

88
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,370
What do you think, Law?

89
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,340
You know them well, don't you?

90
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,350
Two years ago, at Sabaody and Marineford,

91
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,970
THE STRAW HATS ARE BACK

92
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,400
you got involved with the Straw Hat twice.

93
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,930
What?

94
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,340
You didn't summon them here, did you?

95
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,890
I told you that I didn't know they were

96
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:33,650
held captive in the lab until I
ran into them at the entrance.

97
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,860
If I knew, I would have warned you...

98
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,410
...that locking them up
in a room wasn't enough.

99
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,670
I wasn't able to drive the Navy
out thanks to your carelessness.

100
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,830
You know it's bad news for me, too,

101
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,510
if anybody finds out about this place.

102
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,390
Master!

103
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,770
Not now. I'm doing an experiment.

104
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,650
But it's a Warlord!

105
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,510
What did you say?

106
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,860
You wanna stay on Punk Hazard?

107
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,280
It was a pain getting here since Log
Poses don't work for this island

108
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,410
because there was the
Government's secret facility.

109
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,540
Why do you want to stay?

110
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,440
Since this used to be Dr.
Vegapunk's laboratory,

111
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,590
I assume there are traces leading
up to today of Government activity.

112
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:40,390
All I'm asking for is free roam within
the laboratory and the island.

113
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,730
I can help you with something if you want.

114
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,520
And we'll stay out of each other's business.

115
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,170
But it means you can't tell
anybody that I'm here.

116
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,590
Not even "Joker."

117
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,620
You know a lot. How did
you know all those things?

118
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,190
Do you prefer to have an
amateur who doesn't know

119
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,610
anything over me?

120
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,630
I see what you mean.
We're birds of a feather.

121
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,860
Although I can't trust you, perhaps
there's no harm in what you ask.

122
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,810
What do you think, Monet?

123
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,220
He is from the North Blue.

124
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,710
The Surgeon of Death.

125
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,470
An Op-Op Fruit eater.

126
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,080
So you're a doctor, huh?

127
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,700
There are a whole bunch

128
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,940
of former prisoners who were
paralyzed by poison gas.

129
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,480
Can you treat them?

130
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,450
Well,

131
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,430
you would've been wiser about it if you

132
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,220
wanted to summon your friends here.

133
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,540
You became a Warlord intentionally

134
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,180
by kissing the Government's
ass and came to this island.

135
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,940
I don't think you would do
something to mess that all up.

136
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,590
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,140
You said...

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,870
...those kids will have an urge to come

139
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,270
back here even if you don't do anything.

140
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,300
What do you mean by that?

141
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,770
Oh.

142
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,520
That's because I'm giving them
this drug candy everyday.

143
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,400
When you eat it, it's sweet and fizzy!

144
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,520
And gas fills up your mouth.

145
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,120
It causes instant addiction!

146
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,190
If they go back to their homes,
they won't be able to have it.

147
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,750
You're a sick man. You remind me of somebody.

148
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,710
Aren't you gonna fight the Navy?

149
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,950
Call me if you need me.

150
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,330
I'll cut whoever's head for you.

151
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,690
It's hard dealing with a smart guy.

152
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,320
I wonder how far Zoro went.

153
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,050
He's with Sanji and Brook so I don't think

154
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,970
he's lost in the snow-capped mountains.

155
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,790
Wh-What happened?!

156
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,460
Again! What's going on?!

157
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,300
This is not an earthquake or anything!

158
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,470
We're under attack!

159
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,060
What are they?

160
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,550
They are footprints, aren't they?

161
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,870
Is it an animal?

162
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,900
If it's a human, he must be a Giant.

163
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,640
--Are those bomb blasts?
--That's from the direction we came from.

164
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,910
Does it have something to
do with these footprints?

165
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,920
I sense something. Two
beast-looking creatures.

166
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,210
Let's go back! Nami and
the others are in danger!

167
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,470
Y-Yeah!

168
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,640
Oh no!

169
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,990
If it collapses, the kids are...

170
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,340
Luffy! Everybody! Come back!

171
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,590
There's no time!

172
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,690
We have to handle this on our own!

173
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,250
Do you see anybody?

174
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,990
How many are there? What do they look like?

175
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,760
Well...

176
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,880
Nobody's out there!

177
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,260
No way!

178
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,440
Let's get the party started.

179
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,210
So cool!

180
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,690
What're we gonna do?!

181
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,230
Where are they?!

182
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,790
Ow, ow, ow...

183
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,510
Oh, I fell asleep.

184
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,570
Something's going on outside.

185
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,950
Somebody's come to rescue me, maybe?

186
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,300
Law? The Master?

187
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,250
No, we're on a snow-capped
mountain so it must be them!

188
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,670
Hey, brown guy! You know
something, don't you?!

189
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,130
Who is it?! You better say
it or you'll get this!

190
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,800
Beam!

191
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,970
Beam! Beam!

192
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,060
Beam! Beam!

193
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,320
You're not taking the beam seriously!

194
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,320
It's no use looking for them because
they'll never show themselves!

195
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,650
We don't even know their faces.

196
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,700
What?

197
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,490
However,

198
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,300
they'll carry out an assassination at
any cost in exchange for their reward.

199
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,440
All we know about them is their

200
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,500
footprints are huge and they have low voices.

201
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,230
Oh yeah! There is one
more thing that we know.

202
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,420
They're furry, giant, beast-like men.

203
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,850
The Snow Mountain Killers - stalking
out from deep in the snowstorm!

204
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,230
And we happened to know their
names - Rock and Scotch!

205
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,850
People call them the Yeti Cool Brothers!

206
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,310
We really don't know much about them

207
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,270
but they were from a snowy
region and their age is...

208
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,360
You know a lot!

209
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,990
But nobody knows what they really look like.

210
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,570
They're giant and tough!

211
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,530
And they came here to rescue me!

212
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,850
Your names are on their kill list now!

213
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,950
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

214
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,970
Your name is also on our kill list.

215
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,640
What's with that guy?!

216
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,480
He's huge but I didn't notice he was here!

217
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,720
Huh? Are you Rock?

218
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,360
--I'm Scotch.
--You just made a joke, I think.

219
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,270
Oh, I probably misheard it.

220
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,820
Gee, was I scared!

221
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,910
The Master asked you to save me, right?

222
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,910
Then just unchain me and let's
take care of the Straw Hats...

223
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,280
You didn't mishear it.

224
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm here to kill you by the Master's request.

225
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,190
No way!

226
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,890
Listen.

227
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,710
Oh yeah, and what was that guy's name?

228
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,920
It's his voice!

229
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,720
He has been captured by them.
That shit with a beard.

230
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,150
He was known for his stupidity.
Oh yes, Brownbeard!

231
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,150
What? Master!

232
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,890
That's him?

233
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,460
He was easy to manipulate because
he was so dumb, but he's a pain now.

234
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,810
I don't need him.

235
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,470
Kill him.

236
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,000
Hey, I was right! There's smoke!

237
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,340
Nami! Chopper! Are you all right?!

238
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,640
Answer my question. You're
Brownbeard, aren't you?

239
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,740
I'm glad that you got here.

240
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,160
You'll be alright. Don't worry.

241
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,250
You are...

242
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,920
Be quiet.

243
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,140
These are...

244
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,100
Your new legs.

245
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,320
No...

246
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,540
How is it going?

247
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,220
Master! It's all clear around
here today like any other day!

248
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,290
Good.

249
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,750
Brownbeard, you're such
a great security officer.

250
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,340
You're flattering me!

251
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,800
No...

252
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,310
No...

253
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,020
No!

254
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,740
Master!!

255
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,700
How annoying! You should
drop dead in a cooler way!

256
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,250
Hey, Scotch!

257
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,330
There's another one!

258
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,930
Don't shoot too wildly. You
don't wanna hit those brats.

259
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,350
Oops. That's not cool.

260
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,220
Brownbeard!

261
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,980
How terrible! They're on the same side!

262
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,810
Look at that. Their captain is back.

263
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,520
Let's start with them.

264
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,780
Huh? They're pretty big.

265
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,700
--Are they Giants?
--No, they're slightly different.

266
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,670
You guys, you didn't harm
my friends, did you?!

267
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,430
Oh? Where did he go?!

268
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,790
Luffy!

269
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,910
You alright?

270
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,620
I'm sorry! They took Nami with them!

271
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,760
What?!

272
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,090
He said he wants this one alive.

273
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,760
A robot with Vegapunk's laser weapon, huh?

274
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,650
And kill all the rest.

275
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,190
Okay, let's enjoy every minute of this hunt.

276
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,910
In a cool way!

277
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,700
I assume the detachment team must
have stolen the ship by now.

278
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,160
What is that sound?

279
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,630
THE LABORATORY - THE FRONT AREA

280
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,380
We've been ambushed!

281
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,260
It's not gonna be that easy, huh?

282
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,350
Let's go!

283
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,690
THE LABORATORY - THE BACKDOOR

284
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,410
--Oh?
--Law-san, where are you going?

285
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,460
We just ran into the Navy.

286
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,960
Room.

287
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,250
I don't give a damn.

288
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,690
I'm free to go...

289
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,610
...wherever I want.

290
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,290
In order to get Nami back,

291
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,970
Luffy and crew go after the assassins.

292
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,990
However, the ingenious trap
set within the snowy mountain,

293
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,750
and the relentless attacks from the Cool Brothers

294
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,140
send Luffy into a dilemma. But then

295
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,270
Law appears and makes an unbelievable move.

296
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,780
On the next episode of One Piece!

297
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,650
"Save Nami! Luffy's Fight on
the Snow-Capped Mountains!"

298
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,910
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
