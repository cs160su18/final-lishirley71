00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

13

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660
Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210
If you want to go to the unbelievable world

22

Being brazen, is it a crime?

29

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,850
We won’t left anyone behind

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
mezasu mirai wa onaji--

56
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

57
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,320
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

60
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,380
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,850
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,060
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,400
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,900
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,660
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,120
The Straw Hats find themselves caught up in
the turmoil and involved in an all-out war.

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,040
Now, Hordy's merciless plot puts the
Fish-Man Island in unprecedented danger!

81
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,510
Weren't you listening to what I said?

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,600
I will save the Fish-Man
Island and Shirahoshi...

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,100
Luffy-sama...

84
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,480
...and keep my promise to a friend.

85
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,190
Straw Hat...

86
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,650
I'll protect...

87
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,400
...everything!

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,150
Song of Scratches, Blizzard Slice!

89
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,280
Impact Wolf!

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,490
Cloven Rose, Palm!

91
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,860
Franky...

92
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,580
Squid! Squid! Squid!

93
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,580
...Radical Beam!

94
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,420
Vagabond Drill!

95
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,050
Hell Memories!

96
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,420
Purgatory...

97
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,760
...Onigiri!

98
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,010
Gum-Gum...

99
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,180
...Elephant Gun!

100
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,690
I will stop the Noah!

101
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,150
Keep falling, Noah!

102
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:09,080
Kill all the pride-less Fish-Men!

103
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,260
Gum-Gum...

104
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,430
...Elephant Gatling!

105
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:37,480
"Stop, Noah! Desperate Elephant Gatling!"

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,550
Even those demon-like officers are a joke
to them. That's how strong they are!

107
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,870
Stay alert!

108
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,040
Look up! You're in danger!

109
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,300
What?!

110
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,670
--Wadatsumi is...
--...Falling toward us!

111
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,190
You should've dropped him
elsewhere, you worthless chef!

112
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,860
Shut up! I'll make someone
fall onto you next time!

113
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,450
That was amazing, Sanji.

114
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,590
Hey Chopper! Could you shrink
yourself a little bit?

115
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,470
You're upstaging the giant robot!

116
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,600
Franky, I loved the beam!

117
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,050
That robot was totally useless.

118
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,980
Oh! Nami-san!

119
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,170
What?

120
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,770
Please wear a miniskirt.

121
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,690
Shut up!

122
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,360
That's just what I'd expect
from Luffy-kun's friends.

123
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,960
He did it!

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,000
This time for sure! Luffy-san beat Hordy!

125
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,390
--Did you hear that?
--Yeah...

126
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,410
The Straw Hats defeated
the New Fish-Man Pirates!

127
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Hey.

128
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,630
The Noah!

129
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,230
The Noah is right there!

130
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,110
Run!

131
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,400
It's gonna destroy us along with the island!

132
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,540
If we stay here any longer, Neptune's
army will bar us in the plaza!

133
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,910
Hurry up! Those crazy officers are gone now!

134
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,800
Oh my goodness! How is the evacuation going?!

135
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,960
Only a few citizens have escaped to the sea.

136
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,420
Most people are still here on the island!

137
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,800
Are you okay?

138
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,840
Is it too late?!

139
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,150
Can't you do anything, Straw Hat?!

140
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,350
Straw Hat!

141
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,160
The threat of rebellion is now gone but...

142
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,500
This is it!

143
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,080
No, not yet!

144
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,340
What?

145
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,010
He is not...

146
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,060
...giving up yet!

147
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,130
Straw Hat Luffy-san is...

148
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,610
...trying his best...

149
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,870
...to destroy...

150
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,290
...the Noah!

151
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,970
Destroy the Noah?!

152
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,670
Trying to destroy it?

153
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,530
Destroy that giant ship?!

154
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,590
Really?! That's impossible!

155
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,400
Prepare for the worst, guys!

156
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,820
Yeah. Let's just stand by him.

157
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,530
Luffy-san!

158
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,670
Luffy-sama!

159
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,550
If he can destroy the Noah before it
hits the island, we'll be okay but...

160
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,430
...if he can't,

161
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,180
the Fish-Man Island will fall!

162
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,790
Give it everything you got, Luffy!

163
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,680
--Luffy-san!
--We're counting on you, Luffy!

164
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,400
Luffy!

165
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,240
Luffy-kun!

166
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,470
What's wrong?!

167
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,700
I'm not gonna run!

168
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,600
Don't be ridiculous! Can't you see the Noah?!

169
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,630
I know! I know, but...

170
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,240
...Straw Hat's heroic actions
bring back memories of...

171
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
...what happened 20 years
ago when I was a kid!

172
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,100
There was one human that the people of
this kingdom thanked with all our hearts!

173
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,950
What a haul!

174
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,570
Hey wait!

175
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,580
No!

176
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,540
Who are you?! Do you wanna die?!

177
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,960
You got to be kidding me! Why is he...

178
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,130
...taking the Fish-Men's side?!

179
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,720
Neptune helped me when we
were young and we exchanged

180
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,430
cups of sake as a pledge of friendship!

181
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,960
Don't kill me! I promise I'll never
kidnap Mermaids and Fish-Men!

182
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,290
Don't mess with my friend's country!

183
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,380
You wet-nosed brats!

184
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,750
I declare that this island
is my territory now!

185
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,130
Are you talking about Whitebeard?!

186
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,190
Are you saying you trust them like
you trusted the great pirate?!

187
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,750
Because,

188
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,060
to be honest, I don't even like humans

189
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,200
and this is the Fish-Men's kingdom,

190
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,590
but they...

191
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,660
Our minds were made up when
we arrived at the plaza that,

192
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,960
along with Jimbei, we wouldn't
let anyone harm the island!

193
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,490
Leave it all up to us, Brother-hoshi!

194
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,020
We're friends, right?

195
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,910
He said such things and they're
all risking their lives...

196
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,220
Straw Hat...

197
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,290
Don't lose, Straw Hat!

198
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,270
Yeah, Straw Hat, we're supporting you!

199
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,350
Hang in there, Straw Hat!

200
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,350
--You're a human and you're fighting for us!
--We're not gonna run!

201
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,270
Go, Big Bro Straw Hat!

202
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,780
Please save the Fish-Man Island, Straw Hat!

203
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,100
Go, Straw Hat!

204
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,250
We believe in you!

205
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,420
Straw Hat!

206
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,960
Straw Hat!

207
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,500
Straw Hat!

208
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,300
Luffy-chan!

209
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,120
Straw Hat!

210
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,880
Straw Hat!

211
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,850
Straw Hat!

212
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,140
Straw Hat!

213
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,770
Straw Hat!

214
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,730
Straw Hat!

215
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,440
Straw Hat!

216
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,840
--Straw Hat!
--Straw Hat!

217
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,030
--Straw Hat!
--Straw Hat!

218
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,210
Stop, Noah!

219
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,060
Stop!

220
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,180
Stop!

221
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,960
I only broke half of it so far!

222
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,260
Luffy-sama!

223
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,100
The wound is opening up...

224
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,580
Stay away!

225
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,230
Stay there and watch!

226
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,360
I need to keep destroying this thing now!

227
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,910
Stop, ship!

228
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,290
--Straw Hat!
--Straw Hat!

229
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,170
Luffy, go for it!

230
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,340
Break it into pieces!

231
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,720
Super!

232
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,400
I'm sorry, Father.

233
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,860
Destroying the Noah is the only way.

234
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,740
Straw Hat!

235
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,990
The Ship of Promise...

236
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,960
But it cannot be helped.

237
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,750
People's lives are the most important.

238
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,660
I am sorry. I cannot keep the promise-jamon,

239
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,710
Joy Boy!

240
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,970
Just a little more to go!

241
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,310
Please...

242
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,650
Stop.

243
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,750
Who is it?!

244
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,990
Luffy-sama! Please stop!

245
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,550
Luffy-sama, you have to stop!

246
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,810
Move, Yowahoshi! I need to
destroy it to save the island!

247
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,740
It's okay now!

248
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,140
It's not okay! Everybody's on the island!

249
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,530
The Noah is already...

250
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,980
...stopped!

251
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,750
Sea Kings? Why?

252
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,510
Luffy-sama is angry!

253
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,050
Hey, this is no time for crying!

254
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,920
I don't quite understand, either.

255
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,400
But the Noah is stopped now!

256
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,570
What happened?!

257
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,580
What's going on here? The
Sea Kings stopped the ship!

258
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,520
Luffy-sama! The wound is opening up again!

259
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,750
You are bleeding a lot!

260
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,930
Well... Well... That's good...

261
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,590
...as long as the ship is stopped.

262
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,650
I'm glad everybody's...

263
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,400
...safe.

264
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,390
Luffy-sama!

265
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,860
He's fine.

266
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,770
Boy, what a human!

267
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,580
He is a very strong one, isn't he?

268
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,890
If we were late, we could
still have saved the island

269
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,600
but the Noah would have
been completely destroyed.

270
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,360
I'm glad that we made it!

271
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,570
I'm glad that Princess Shirahoshi called us!

272
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,490
What? I didn't do anything
and I was just sad...

273
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:11,030
No, you were moved by Straw
Hat boy's strong determination

274
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,100
and prayed.

275
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:25,620
You wished strongly to
help him save the island.

276
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,910
Our power is your power.

277
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,420
We helped him because you called us.

278
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,470
A-All people of the kingdom.

279
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:15,140
Wh-What just happened here was beyond words

280
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,640
but it happened for sure!

281
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,560
The Noah is stopped!

282
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,850
The ship didn't get destroyed completely

283
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,990
and the Fish-Man Island has been saved!

284
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,700
Straw Hat did it!

285
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,210
--Straw Hat!
--So we're safe, aren't we?

286
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,060
Yeah!

287
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,470
Straw Hat!

288
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,590
I'm so relieved!

289
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,210
--Yeah!
--Oh, he did it!

290
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,190
Luffy did it!!

291
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,400
Fish-Man Island is saved.

292
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,400
However, in his fight to achieve this...

293
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,420
...Luffy is in critical condition
with a multitude of wounds.

294
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,140
Yet the Fish-Men, still bound
by the island's past...

295
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,470
...hesitate to come to his aid.

296
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,030
Just when Luffy is almost out of time...

297
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,520
...a single man's actions
alter the course of history.

298
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,110
On the next episode of One Piece!

299
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,620
"The Secret Revealed! The Truth
about the Ancient Weapon!"

300
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
