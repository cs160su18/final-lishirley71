2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,000
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,070
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:50,100
He and the Whitebeards finally got over the
cling walls to make it to the scaffold!

62
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,540
In the midst of the Navy's onslaught, Luffy
runs toward Ace with the Whitebeards' tance!

63
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,680
Finally... finally...

64
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,020
I made it!

65
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,790
Luffy!

66
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,310
You're so...!

67
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,030
Fire! Blow them away!

68
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,410
There's a tunnel of fire in the smoke!

69
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,670
You've always been like this!

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
Luffy!

71
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,220
You've never even listened to me...

72
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,310
...and always done such crazy things!

73
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,610
Ace!!

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,220
"Ace Rescued! Whitebeard's Final Order!"

75
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,860
"F-Fire Fist" Ace is...

76
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,860
...now free!

77
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,360
Great! You did it, Straw Hat!

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,570
He rescued Ace!

79
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:57,000
He has been relentless since
Impel Down! That guy is really...

80
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,790
...Something else!

81
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,210
I'm relieved!

82
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,180
You finally accomplished your mission, Luffy!

83
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,890
If we can escape here in one piece...

84
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,680
We'll be married!

85
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,570
Look, Coby! Damn Straw Hat finally did it!

86
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,740
Luffy-san, you're awesome!

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,120
Don't lose your cool!  Be ready to fire!

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,370
--Shoot them as they land!
--Yes, sir!

89
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,870
Stay alert, Luffy! Let's split up for now!

90
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,040
Okay!

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,710
Oh no!

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,010
Flame Commandment!

93
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,760
Fire Pillar!

94
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,670
He's so strong! Be careful!

95
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,930
Can you fight, Luffy?

96
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,600
Of course!

97
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,350
Ace-san! Luffy-kun!

98
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,860
Don't forget! "Fire Fist"
Ace is fire--Logia type!

99
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,530
I never thought that I'd
be saved by you one day!

100
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,240
Thanks, Luffy!

101
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,290
Whitebeard and the others helped me to do it!

102
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,180
Don't think that you're safe now!

103
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,790
This is now your execution ground!

104
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,850
--Now is the chance!
--I'll cut you into pieces!

105
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,940
He's my brother! Leave him alone!

106
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,840
Fire Fist!

107
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,420
Second Gear!

108
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,460
Shave!

109
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,590
Gum-Gum...

110
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,230
...Jet Stamp!

111
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,880
Fire Gun!

112
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,390
Die!

113
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,410
Let's hurry, Luffy! We gotta
get out of this place!

114
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,500
Alright!

115
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,630
They make a perfect pair!

116
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,460
Make room for them to run!

117
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,050
Don't let them get away at any cost!

118
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,640
Firefly!

119
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,600
Fiery Doll!

120
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,900
Execute "Fire Fist" and Straw Hat!

121
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,360
Gum-Gum...

122
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,320
...Jet Gatling!

123
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,160
You got stronger, Luffy!

124
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll become stronger than you someday!

125
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,930
Then, let me protect you for now!

126
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,310
"Someday?" There's no tomorrow for you.

127
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,900
You think that you can escape?

128
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,190
Admiral Kuzan!

129
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,530
That bastard!

130
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,910
Ice Block!

131
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,990
Back up, Luffy.

132
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,980
Pheasant Beak!

133
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,550
Flame Mirror!

134
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,310
Aokiji-san's ice was instantly vaporized!

135
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,230
He's our 2nd division commander!
Of course, he's capable of that!

136
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,400
--Cool!
--What brothers!

137
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,860
Stop being impressed, you boneheads!

138
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,280
Fix the Transponder Snail already!

139
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,830
Y-Yes, sir!

140
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,800
And now, I wonder how far he can run...
The important part begins here, Straw Hat!

141
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:08,180
At any rate, if I can finish off Whitebeard
who's already dying in this confusion...

142
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
...then I'll join The Four Emperors!

143
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,860
Wow! He's relaxing during a situation
like this! That's our Captain Buggy!

144
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,030
Mr. 2...

145
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,960
I hardly granted your wish.

146
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,830
And now, I gotta hurry and escape...

147
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,080
To whom does this traitor owe allegiance?!

148
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,880
No, he's a prisoner impersonating a guard!

149
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,550
Oh no!

150
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,090
Fleet Admiral-dono!

151
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,800
I can't believe this blunder!
Even I couldn't stop it!

152
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,060
Let them go! That way, things
will be more interesting!

153
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,650
Cut the crap!

154
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,080
Even an admiral's power
is useless against them!

155
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,070
How can we fight them?!

156
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,070
Don't lose your head!

157
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,530
Admiral Sakazuki!

158
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,740
We won't let them get away from here!

159
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,210
Don't be afraid! Let's beat them!

160
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,220
W-What now?!

161
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,940
Heads up, everyone! Their ship is moving!

162
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,150
Don't get close! It's running
on the ground with its paddles!

163
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,940
Hey, who is on board?!

164
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,620
--Squard!
--The Whirl Spider Pirates!

165
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,790
Pops, everyone, run!

166
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,710
Leave the war to us!

167
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,010
Those fools!

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,080
Don't be silly, Squard!

169
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,750
Obviously, you have a death wish!

170
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,170
Of course, I have.

171
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,220
What I did to Pops was horrible.

172
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,480
Even if this doesn't make amends for it,

173
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,890
I can't let things go like this!

174
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,950
I'm sorry, guys. I shouldn't have let you on.

175
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,160
--It's okay, Captain! Don't worry!
--We followed you because we wanted to!

176
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,710
We'll choose where to die our own!

177
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,260
Captain! We'll follow you to the end!

178
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,810
I'm sorry...

179
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,550
Everybody, take Ace and run!

180
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,260
St. Elmo's Fire!

181
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,730
Squard!

182
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,110
Fool!

183
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,610
Damn Squard! That's not
the smart way to do it!

184
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,120
Hey! Hurry up and uncuff me!

185
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,080
You guys! Are you all ready?!

186
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,150
Advance!

187
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,900
Pops!

188
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,520
What happened?!

189
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,290
The ship has stopped!

190
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,760
Pops!

191
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,770
W-With just one hand...

192
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,770
He stopped the ship!

193
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,670
Can't you understand how
ungrateful it is for a child...

194
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,340
...to die before his parent, Squard?!

195
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,220
Don't get too confident!

196
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,980
That little stab wound that you created
doesn't really jeopardize my life!

197
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,610
Everybody has his own duration of life!

198
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,000
We accomplished our goal here!

199
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,420
There's no need to stay here anymore!

200
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,040
--Good old man!
--Pops!

201
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,230
Listen carefully, Whitebeard Pirates!

202
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,060
I'm gonna give you an order
from the Captain one last time!

203
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,690
What do you mean "last?!"
Wait, Pops, that's too sad!

204
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,940
I don't wanna hear such thing!

205
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,610
Let's go back to the New World together!

206
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,830
Cross Fire!

207
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,870
Pops!

208
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,460
All of you and I will split up from here!

209
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:58,090
Everyone, survive at any cost and
go back to the New World safely!

210
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,640
P-Pops! Are you planning to die here?!

211
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,610
I'm a remnant from the old times!

212
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,450
There is no ship that can
bear me in the new era!

213
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,870
Go, you guys!!

214
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,720
Whitebeard!

215
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,320
No, Pops!

216
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,520
It's an order! We gotta go!

217
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,940
Old guy!

218
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,740
Pops!

219
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,960
Don't look back!

220
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,700
Because the era is changing!

221
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,770
Everything started on that sea...

222
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,480
This is unbelievable!

223
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,370
Hey, why do you look so out of spirits?

224
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,500
Join us! There's more than enough treasure!

225
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,070
Never mind about him.

226
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,940
Huh? What do you mean? We got
these treasures thanks to him...

227
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,110
Just leave him! He's not
interested in treasures.

228
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,420
That's odd! What kind of pirate is he?

229
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,760
What is it that you want?

230
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,240
Hey, Newgate!

231
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,860
I've been traveling a very long time.

232
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,990
Let's get it over with!

233
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,080
Navy!

234
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,660
Following Whitebeard's last order, the
pirates swallow their sadness and retreat.

235
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,530
But Akainu's cruel words
directed at Whitebeard

236
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,980
stop Ace in his tracks.

237
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,350
Ace shakes off his friends' protests and
leaps forward--to be met by Akainu's fist!

238
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,820
On the next episode of One Piece!

239
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,260
"The Power That Can Burn Even
Fire! Akainu's Ruthless Pursuit!"

240
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
