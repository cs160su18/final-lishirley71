2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,700
Don't take life so lightly!

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,770
You can be rather cruel.

49
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,690
They're moving right before your very eyes,
and you think they aren't alive?

50
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,060
Behold!

51
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,870
Now start licking the floor, Cindry.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,160
Okay, Hogback-sama.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,590
When a human's heart isn't linked
to her body, she is no longer human!

54
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,430
By using corpses that can't
stick up for themselves,

55
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,010
you're creating nothing but monsters!

56
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,600
For every zombie you create,
you're making a person miserable!

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,140
Don't lecture me on life when you're
a mediocre doctor, pirate reindeer!

58
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,070
Cindry-chan, finish those two off!

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,630
One! Two! Three!

60
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,170
You don't have to listen to
that monster! Ow, ow, ow...

61
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,180
I will kill you!

62
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,390
Is the ability to move all that matters?

63
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,350
Humans are freer than that!

64
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,050
You're the one who treats them
like they aren't humans!

65
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,230
Dogguin! Jigoro! Help Cindry out!

66
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,940
Take out the pests!

67
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,700
Three-Sword Style...

68
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,450
...108-Pound Phoenix!

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,170
Why did you attack me along with them?!

70
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,520
Jump! Jump! I want you to
jump out the window together!

71
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,410
I cannot...

72
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,000
move.

73
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,250
C-Cindry!

74
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,320
He's here! He's here!

75
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,840
Wh-Who's here?

76
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,130
Well, now you get to meet him,

77
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,760
Straw Hat.

78
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,960
"Oars Roars! Come Out, Straw Hat Crew!"

79
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,420
Hey, what's gotten into you, Cindry-chan?

80
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,420
Come on, Cindry-chan!

81
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,080
Cindry-chan! Earth to Cindry-chan!

82
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,010
Hey, what's the matter?

83
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,820
I...

84
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,570
cannot move.

85
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,740
I cannot stop crying.

86
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,150
You can't move? What the
heck are you talking about?

87
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,980
And dry those crocodile tears!

88
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,760
Do you realize who gave you a body

89
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,330
that can move as long as you have a soul?!

90
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,290
You exist to serve your master!

91
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,860
That is how zombies find
meaning in their existence!

92
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,960
It looks like the owner of
her body is trying to resist him.

93
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,600
She died ten years ago.

94
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,170
Could the body still have a
will even if the soul has left?

95
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,140
Even if we scoured every library in the world,
I doubt we could find an answer.

96
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,020
I will kill those two.

97
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,900
Atta girl! You've finally returned
to your senses, Cindry-chan!

98
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,030
Be sure to buy lots of time!
Enough for me to get away.

99
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,430
What a pity. I was hoping
for some kind of miracle.

100
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,500
Doce Fleurs!

101
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,350
Tsk!

102
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,090
Wait!

103
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,800
Like I'm gonna wait!

104
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,180
Wh-Why is the room shaking?!

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,060
Damn it! You're a pirate reindeer
just pretending to be human!

106
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,480
How dare you side with a bunch of corpses?!

107
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,230
You aren't even human, you stinking monster!

108
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,610
A monster, a cyborg, a pervert,
a guy with a long nose,

109
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,770
and a moss head follow my captain!

110
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,390
Unlike you guys, he doesn't
have to boss around corpses

111
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,830
that can't speak for themselves!

112
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,250
Let go, freak!

113
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,710
Robin!

114
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,670
All right! I'm on it.

115
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,950
Pierna Fleurs!

116
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,860
Huh? What's going on?

117
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,680
What? What? What?!

118
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,730
W-W-Wait, Dr. Chopper! If I fall
from this height and hit my head,

119
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,360
my genius noggin that is a gift
to the world will crack open!

120
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,650
Are you okay with that?

121
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,330
I don't care!

122
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,120
The zombies are less rotten
than the stuff between your ears!

123
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,620
Why don't you calm down a bit, Dr. Chopper?

124
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,710
Eat this! Robi-Cho Suplex!

125
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,450
He's twice the size of a giant.

126
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,680
So this is my zombie?

127
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,850
I've been waiting for you, Oars!

128
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,190
It looks like your shadow has
finally settled into your body.

129
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,020
Have you become an obedient zombie?

130
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,150
Tell me! Who is your master?

131
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,320
My master is Moria-sama.

132
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,920
What?!

133
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,870
Hey, how could you say that?!
Are you really my shadow?

134
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,540
Don't listen to this jerk!

135
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,460
Who are you, punk in the straw hat?

136
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,430
Let me present your
commemorative first mission.

137
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,770
Look at the wanted posters
attached to your arm!

138
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,890
Those ruffians are currently
running amok on Thriller Bark.

139
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,240
They are the Straw Hat Crew!

140
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,940
Crush them mercilessly and
toss them onto their ship!

141
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,570
I don't care if any of them die.

142
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,240
Those worth over 100 million
won't die if you squash them anyway.

143
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,870
Cut loose! Let me see
the extent of your power.

144
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,540
Okay, Moria-sama.

145
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,330
Ah, there's one! It's Straw Hat!

146
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,140
Goodbye, Straw Hat!

147
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,070
You're running away?! You jerk!

148
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,600
Gum-Gum...

149
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,190
H-H-Hey, wait! That's dangerous!

150
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,030
...Bell!

151
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,080
What?!

152
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,880
What's that?

153
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,670
L-Luffy's zombie...!

154
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,420
Oars!

155
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,520
The floor is collapsing!
Chopper, come over here!

156
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,390
Okay!

157
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,260
Huh?!

158
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,560
Ouch!

159
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,740
That was a close call.

160
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,460
This... is Luffy...

161
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,430
Hogback and Cindry fell down a floor.

162
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,640
Crap! This is heavy.

163
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,740
Cindry-chan, get this stone slab off of me!

164
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,540
C-Cindry-chan, hurry! Save me on the double!

165
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,520
Look! Oars is coming.

166
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,970
I... I can't get stepped
on when I'm a genius!

167
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,220
Hey! Why are you just standing there?

168
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,140
I'm your master!

169
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,310
I... cannot move.

170
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,220
I... cannot move.

171
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,810
What?!

172
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,790
You're repeating that nonsense again?!

173
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,460
Your sense of loyalty is
the only will zombies have!

174
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,010
Now save me already!

175
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,600
Your looks are all you
have, you crappy corpse!

176
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,500
Hey! Hurry it up, Cindry!

177
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,190
Oars is coming!

178
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,970
Oars, look down! You imbecile!

179
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,430
It's me, you wretched ingrate!

180
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,680
I'm the one who modified your
body so that you could move!

181
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What gives?! What gives?!

182
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,740
That last quake was way worse
than any of the ones before it!

183
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,710
L-L-L... Luffy's zombie!

184
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What is making everything shake?!

185
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,440
What gives?!

186
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,700
No way! Is that Luffy's zombie?!

187
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,370
Crap!

188
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,580
Nami-san, seriously! This isn't
the time to get your beauty sleep!

189
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,500
Screw it! I'm gonna have to run for now.

190
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,020
Huh? Nami-san?

191
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,140
Nami-san?

192
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,970
Wh-What?!

193
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,820
Nami-san vanished...

194
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,270
It couldn't be...!

195
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,620
It looks like the tables are turned.

196
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,950
Jerk! You're still alive?

197
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,030
Beast Man, show yourself!

198
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,790
It looks like we finally
have control of this devil.

199
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,090
I've won! This time she will be my bride!

200
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,850
Damn it! Give Nami-san back!

201
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,460
Where the hell are you?!

202
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,730
Have him play with you!
Enjoy the ultimate zombie!

203
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,500
Hey, did you feel that just now?

204
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,170
Yes, I did. It was so ominous
that it made my hair stand on end.

205
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,880
Oh! But since I'm a skeleton,
I don't have any hair!

206
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,090
Ah! I do have hair!

207
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,890
Punk! That's your precious afro!
Don't forget about it!

208
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,470
Maybe you'd rather have
a pompadour hairstyle!

209
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,710
--Uh, pass!
--Come over here!

210
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,640
No, don't! Don't cut it!

211
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,190
What is that?

212
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm getting goose bumps!

213
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,120
Oh! I'm a skeleton, so--

214
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,060
Gah! Something just popped out!

215
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,140
What is that?!

216
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,810
Th-That's... a zombie!

217
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,370
It's Luffy's zombie.

218
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,450
Look over there!
Didn't Curly Cook come out with him?

219
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,290
Damn it!

220
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,390
Nami-san...

221
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,730
What is that stupid cook doing?

222
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,690
Wait!

223
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,010
Moria!

224
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,820
Are you going to chase
after me no matter what?

225
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,450
I'm worried about that huge zombie,

226
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,210
but taking you down is the only way
to recover everyone's shadows.

227
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,000
I won't let you escape!

228
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,760
Look! I am the last one laughing!

229
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,890
She sure is sound asleep.

230
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:58,400
Let's go elsewhere... and hold
the ceremony... one more time,

231
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,990
my quiet bride!

232
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,200
Is Perona-sama all right?

233
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,700
She's unconscious!

234
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,530
I don't see any injuries.

235
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,080
Captain Kumacy and the Lieutenant
were taken out! Curse Long Nose!

236
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,630
Get her out of here!
This mansion is rottin' dangerous!

237
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,220
The Special Zombie will avenge them!

238
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,750
Things look rottin' bad!
Get away from the mansion!

239
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,640
The Special Zombie is fighting!

240
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,520
Get rottin' far!

241
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,680
H-He's huge! I can see
his head over the mansion.

242
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,530
Oh, crap!

243
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,620
Usopp!

244
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,240
Chopper! Robin!

245
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,540
W-W-We've got a problem!

246
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:01,800
O-O-Our wanted posters are
a-attached to Zombie Luffy's arm!

247
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,800
I-I'm sure of it!

248
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,810
He is totally...

249
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,070
...coming after us!

250
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:39,460
Come out, Straw Hat Crew!

251
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,720
The freak! Is he trying to get in our way?

252
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,510
Darn it, Luffy! Are you going
to crush your own crew?

253
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,010
Someone must have issued the order.

254
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,060
I hope the real Luffy is all right.

255
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,520
What is that?!

256
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,980
Can we take that monster down?

257
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,500
This should be fun.

258
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,800
Sanji!

259
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,130
He's insanely fast for someone so huge!

260
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,760
If he lands a solid hit,
it could do serious damage!

261
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,140
Crap! What is he going to do to Sanji?

262
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,430
Hey, get back!

263
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,730
Don't underestimate me, monster!

264
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,650
On the next episode of One Piece!

265
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,730
"Luffy Is the Enemy! The Ultimate
Zombie vs. the Straw Hat Crew!"

266
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
