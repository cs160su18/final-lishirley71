00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,200
Dammit, dammit, dammit!

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,280
How many times do we have
to be attacked by the navy?!

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,620
If you want to survive this,
keep rowing and stop complaining!

22
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,710
We're gonna die!

23
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,930
Hey, Luffy! Give us a hand!

24
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,890
No, I've got no strength...
I haven't eaten since this morning...

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,890
You're hungry now?!

26
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,670
Major! Major Pasqua! Please
report to the bridge immediately!

27
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,230
Major Pasqua!

28
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,160
Major Pasqua!!

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,080
Shut up, dumbass!

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,960
You only have to say so once.

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,120
I-I'm terribly sorry, Major.

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,460
But we're engaging the wanted
criminal Monkey D. Luffy!

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,930
What?!

34
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,170
You sure took your time.

35
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,530
You almost missed this historic encounter.

36
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,680
Hmph. Hand me the binoculars.

37
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,590
No doubt about it.
That's Straw Hat Luffy's flag.

38
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,900
Yes, it is.

39
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,410
The dumbass...

40
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,240
We've been firing warning
shots at them for a bit,

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,830
but they've shown no signs of stopping.

42
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,560
Major, if you would do "it," please...

43
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,070
"It," huh? If you insist.

44
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,910
I think I will.

45
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,870
Oh, here it comes!
The major's special technique!

46
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,740
The one that has sunk countless
pirate ships-- the Finger Bomb!

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,320
--Huh?
--What have you done, Major?!

48
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,300
--What was that?
--They shooting at each other?

49
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,240
Take that, navy rats! I predicted
this would happen from the start!

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,720
When did you predict it?

51
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,440
All right! As their formation collapses,
we'll use this chance to get away!

52
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Rescue the men in the water
from the sinking ship!

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey! Are you all right?!

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,170
The Going Merry is getting farther away!

55
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,670
--All right!
--There's nothing right about it!

56
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,630
--My chance at a billion
Berries... no, my promotion...
--The wheel of fortune is starting to turn, huh?

57
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,010
--...is getting away, Major Pasqua!
--Yeah. Everything is going as history leads it.

58
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,340
Attend to the wounded! The fleet is
setting course for Luluka, as scheduled!

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,110
"Legend of the Rainbow Mist!
Old Man Henzo of Luluka Island"

60
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,460
Where's the navy?

61
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,970
Looks like we gave them the slip.

62
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,790
They've been chasing us pretty hard lately.

63
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,030
When there are two people with
prices on their heads aboard,

64
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,340
you can't blame the navy for going all-out.

65
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,720
"Nico Robin
79 million Berries"

66
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,310
"Monkey D. Luffy
30 million Berries
(actually 100 million Berries)"

67
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,890
"Roronoa Zoro
(actually 60 million Berries)"

68
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,310
Luffy...

69
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,250
Watch yourself. It looks like there are
lots of hidden reefs under the waves.

70
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,560
--There's a harbor!
--What?! A harbor?!

71
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,420
Look! You can see the lighthouse!

72
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,800
A harbor, huh? Which means
there'll be something to eat!

73
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,330
Huh? It's not a lighthouse.

74
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,860
That sure is a tall tower, huh?

75
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,530
Who cares? Let's go get
some food to eat! Food!

76
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,510
All right. Just wipe off that drool.

77
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,900
You there, hold up!

78
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,350
On the island of Luluka,
all ships that moor at our harbor,

79
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,780
or even along our rocks,

80
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,160
must pay harbor dues!

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,930
Harbor dues?

82
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,640
Whatever it is, we have to pay them money.

83
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,920
Hey, why should we have to
pay a tax just for docking here?

84
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,470
Because it's your duty! Will you pay, or not?!

85
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,770
Hey...

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,800
Don't talk like that to a lady.

87
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,510
What?!

88
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,760
Food!

89
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,020
Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!

90
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,340
That bastard...

91
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,470
Are you all right?

92
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,570
Yes! I'm completely fine!

93
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,930
Come on, let's go. I want to get some
blank charts to draw some maps.

94
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,950
I'll accompany you, Nami-san!

95
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,080
I-I'm coming, too!

96
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,090
--J-Just a minute! I'm coming, too! Me too!
--Hey, you there!

97
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,840
There's something I need to ask you.

98
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,480
A new kind of clown?

99
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,800
He might be a swindling salesman.

100
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,470
I'm neither one!

101
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,020
Have you seen a rainbow-colored mist?

102
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,670
Huh? Rainbow-colored mist?

103
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,480
Ah, it's no use. He's an idiot.

104
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,650
You're labeling me?

105
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,290
Hey, just a minute!

106
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,380
What kind of attitude is that,
after asking me a question?!

107
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,780
I wonder if you might tell me about it.

108
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,600
Pops, hit me again!

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,510
Coming up! One more special!

110
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,790
Another for me, too!

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,480
Here's your special.

112
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,010
Hey, you've got money for this, right?

113
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,760
Oh, he's paying.

114
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,290
Whoa, I am?!

115
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,590
I'm telling you the secrets of the
Rainbow Mist. Of course you are.

116
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,470
I'm not the one who asked you!

117
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,440
My name is Henzo.

118
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,650
I'm a genius, repeat, genius scientist
researching the Rainbow Mist.

119
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,250
You can't call yourself a genius.

120
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,570
Anyone who calls themselves
that is no honest fellow.

121
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,700
Mister Henzo...

122
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,040
Call me "professor."

123
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,660
Hey!

124
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,500
Professor, do you know this book?

125
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,580
Is that...?

126
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,980
I came across it in Alabasta.

127
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,760
So that's it. I thought I heard about
the Rainbow Mist somewhere before,

128
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,340
but it turns out it's the name of
the book you're reading, Robin.

129
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,290
I don't know who the author is,

130
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,170
but the book was written over 40 years ago.

131
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,040
According to the book, the Rainbow
Mist is the garden of the gods,

132
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,810
or perhaps El Dorado.

133
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,390
It's recorded as being the
entrance to the City of Gold.

134
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,500
That's nothing more than a legend.

135
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,410
Many adventurers have
been enticed by the legend,

136
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,240
and set off on a journey
to find the Rainbow Mist,

137
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,780
but not a single one of them has returned.

138
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,740
Yes, including my own friends.

139
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,120
So that's why you're researching the mist.

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,210
Sir...

141
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,980
You'd best not take what
he has to say at face value.

142
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,640
How do you mean?

143
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,600
He's one of Mayor Wetton's dogs.

144
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,740
Dogs?

145
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,200
Yeah! He receives research
funding from the mayor,

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200
and lives the easy life! He's a flimflam scientist!

147
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,080
T-The tax collection squad!
The tax collection squad is here!

148
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,160
--What's that?
--Hey, hurry and drink that!

149
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,550
Well, well, good citizens,

150
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,470
are you having an enjoyable mealtime?

151
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,010
You there, you're drinking
some delicious liquor, yes?

152
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,690
When you drink liquor, you need to
pay the liquor-drinking tax, right?

153
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,650
H-H-Hey, wait a minute!

154
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,200
A-All I've got in my wallet is my
wife and kids' living expenses!

155
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,220
It is a citizen's obligation to pay taxes.

156
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,330
Those who neglect their obligations
have no right to live in this town.

157
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,730
Who is this guy?

158
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,630
Mayor Wetton's son, Flip.

159
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,340
A disagreeable bastard, who extorts
all sorts of tax money out of us.

160
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,180
Well, well, Professor Henzo...

161
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,760
Father was looking for you.

162
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,140
He was wondering how
your mist research is coming.

163
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,050
Same as always.

164
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,360
There's no telling when or where
the mist is going to appear, after all.

165
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,570
My, my. Your research is supported
by the citizens' tax money.

166
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,540
The Rainbow Tower over there was
constructed based on your research.

167
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,360
Do not forget that the
slower your research goes,

168
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,820
the more it puts everyone here out.

169
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,820
Well, I will see you later.

170
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,140
Well, well...

171
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,570
You there, you're eating a
heaping plate of spaghetti, yes?

172
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,180
Mm-hmm, I was hungry.

173
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,230
Eating a heaping plate means that
you must pay a heaping tax, right?

174
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,000
He's paying.

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
I am?!

176
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,000
Why me, for pete's sake?

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,960
--Aah, thanks.
--Cram it!

178
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,940
Now you understand.

179
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,430
If you don't want the people
in town to think ill of you,

180
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,900
then stop hanging around with Henzo.

181
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,010
Thanks for the warning.

182
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,980
But that's not up to me to decide.
It's up to the captain.

183
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,460
A-Are you still shopping?

184
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,760
Of course.

185
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,510
I have to buy some blank charts.

186
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,260
If we run out while we're
at sea, we'll be in trouble.

187
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,050
You sure are buying a lot of
unrelated stuff, considering.

188
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,470
Nami-san, I'd follow you into the
depths of hell to go shopping with you!

189
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,790
There they are, Lake-sama! They're the ones!

190
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,160
You're the insolent folks

191
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,650
who didn't pay their taxes
at the harbor, aren't you?

192
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,500
I am Mayor Wetton's grandson, Lake!

193
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,540
I'm the officer who seizes
unpaid taxes from the insolent!

194
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm not exactly sure what's going on here,

195
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,970
but if you're here to throw cold water
on our enjoyable little shopping trip,

196
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,420
you'll get no mercy.

197
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,020
Sanji!

198
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,480
Geez, what are you doing?!

199
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,400
T-The moment I touched
his body, I got a shock.

200
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,080
It's no use. That's what happens
to everyone who touches me.

201
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,590
--Electricity?
--I get it.

202
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,710
He has the abilities of a Devil Fruit!

203
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,180
Your own private generator?!

204
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,630
Dynamo Squad, increase output!

205
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,600
Somehow, this doesn't look good, does it?

206
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,110
Have a good taste of the power
of my electroshock suit!

207
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,700
Rolling Thunder!!

208
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,060
Huh? Was that thunder?

209
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,130
That was close!

210
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,780
Nicely dodged. But that
won't happen this time!

211
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,890
Chopper, look after Nami-san.

212
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,800
Got it!

213
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,560
Sanji-kun, don't do anything reckless, okay?

214
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,020
Yes, don't worry about me!

215
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,020
Uh-uh, those are what I'm worried about.

216
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,730
Oh, these?

217
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,190
S-She's the devil.

218
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,270
It's all right. Not only will they not
get hurt, they won't even get dusty.

219
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,260
You've got a real outrageous mayor here.

220
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,790
He takes money from everywhere,
and says it's for taxes.

221
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,590
Where does he get off calling it
a heaping tax? What a rip-off!

222
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,300
Sorry... everyone...

223
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,190
What are you apologizing for, Pops?

224
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,500
Didn't you listen to what
those guys were saying?

225
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,510
Nope, not a bit.

226
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,960
All right, Pops here is in league
with those rip-off artists.

227
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,300
Everyone's money is being wasted,
on account of his weird research.

228
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,450
Do you really understand what's going on?

229
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,650
--Nope, not a bit.
--Look, Luffy, you've got your snails, right?

230
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,740
--Nope, not at all.
--Hey, what's going on?

231
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,310
It's a ship! A galleon is arriving in the harbor!

232
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,180
--A galleon?
--I-It couldn't be...!

233
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,800
Sounds interesting! Let's go see!

234
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,280
Hey, wait, Luffy!

235
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,670
Ooh, it's huge!

236
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,920
It's quite an old ship, huh?

237
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,600
It's the Talielisin.

238
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,060
The Tali--? W-What? H-Hey, Pops!

239
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,880
That's awesome!

240
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,240
Cool!

241
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,600
Slick! Awesome! I want one! I totally want one!

242
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,120
Yeah, knowing you, I knew you'd say that.

243
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,880
Rolling...

244
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,450
It's no use!

245
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,730
--Sanji!
--Shopping bags!

246
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,060
T-That's just stupid... I dodged it...

247
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,990
You're the stupid one!

248
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,630
Sanji, it's the metal!

249
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,850
The valuables are drawing
the electricity! Get rid of them!

250
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,950
No!

251
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,940
They were expensive!

252
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,820
You know what will happen
if you drop them, don't you?!

253
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,970
Yeah, but... after taking an
electric current as strong as that,

254
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,570
a normal person would already be--

255
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,190
He's not normal, so no problem!

256
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,220
This is bad... If my striking attacks
are completely useless...

257
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,390
--He's running!
--Hey, hold it!
--Ah, Lake-sama!

258
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,190
Now, while we can!

259
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,940
--Hold on to my shopping bags tight!
--Right!

260
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,720
If they're that important, why
don't you carry them yourself?

261
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,540
--Is that wrong?
--No...

262
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,870
Rapa Nui! Isoka!

263
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,240
Rongo! Pukau!

264
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,160
Akibi!

265
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,830
Everyone! Everyone!

266
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,010
Hey, Pops!

267
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,930
Gum-Gum...

268
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,940
...Rocket!!

269
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,560
Y-Your arm...!

270
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,040
Pops, let me have that boat!

271
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,690
Y-You ate a Devil Fruit...?

272
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,040
Me? I'm a rubber man,
who ate the Gum-Gum Fruit.

273
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,480
I can't let you have that machine, the H-1.

274
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,290
Eh? Don't say that, let me have it!

275
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,260
It looks like there were people
here just a little while ago.

276
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,220
There isn't a single person
anywhere on the ship.

277
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,680
This ship is one that went adrift 50 years ago.

278
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,520
50 years ago?!

279
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,560
I have a hard time believing that.

280
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,980
No doubt about it.

281
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,350
The ship is just as it was then.

282
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,280
Whoa, what are you talking about, Pops?

283
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,910
W-What's that?

284
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
I-It's...

285
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,860
My radar is reacting! I've never
had a reading this strong!

286
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,470
That's the Rainbow Mist!

287
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,510
Damn, I can't go out into the open
sea in the H-1! What do I do?

288
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,970
Oh, I know!

289
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,560
--I'm borrowing this!
--What?!

290
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,610
Don't go stealing our ship!

291
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,480
If you wanna go, take the galleon!

292
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,450
The Talielisin's helm is still
broken, by Wetton's hand.

293
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,290
W-What do you mean, Pops?
How do you know that?

294
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,290
Because 50 years ago,
I was aboard the Talielisin.

295
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,840
--It's gone!
--The Going Merry is gone!

296
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,220
Hold on, what's going on here?!

297
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,440
Those guys from earlier must
have taken it, in place of the tax!

298
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,140
If that's the case, it's at the harbor!

299
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,180
Damn, that mossy bastard is good for nothing!

300
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,730
Hey, are we really going in there?

301
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,450
That's a place many
adventures have challenged,

302
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,780
but none have ever returned from, right?

303
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,970
We're going in.

304
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,740
This is the reason why I've kept
up my research through today.

305
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,000
Scared?

306
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,610
N-N-No way am I scared! I am he
who travels all over the Grand Line,

307
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,250
Captain Usopp!

308
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,760
We're charging into the Rainbow Mist!

309
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,290
Professor, where are we?

310
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,210
Ape's Concert.

311
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,240
Ape's Concert? It couldn't be.

312
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,410
W-What's that?!

313
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,880
A ship graveyard, where once
you enter, you can never get out.

314
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,840
W-What?!

315
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,840
Awesome!

316
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,850
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

317
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:28,030
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

318
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:43,750
There are days where I almost lose to myself

319
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:51,790
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

320
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:58,330
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

321
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:08,340
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

322
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:17,600
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

323
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,640
This unique moment...

324
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,650
I was once a pirate, just like you are.
I'm not afraid of a place like this.

325
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,650
You, a pirate? Doesn't look like it to me.

326
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,930
When I was young, I firmly
believed that I could do anything.

327
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,980
But that young pirate still
lives on, inside your heart.

328
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,240
Tell me your story, old-timer.

329
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,630
On the next episode of One Piece!

330
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,690
"Residents of the Land of Eternity!
The Pumpkin Pirates!"

331
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
