2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,820
Luffy was suffering after losing his
brother Ace in the war against the Navy.

60
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,070
The King of the Pirates?!

61
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,490
Just then, Dark King Rayleigh
appeared before Luffy,

62
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,840
who was barely back on his feet.

63
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,700
Here's my second suggestion.

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,100
Meanwhile, the rest of the Straw
Hats learned what happened to Luffy

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,920
and realized how hard it
must have been for him.

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,530
"Encounter! The Great Swordsman Mihawk!
Zoro's Self-Willed Deadly Struggle!"

67
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,400
This is the Gloom Island in the Grand Line -

68
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,800
GLOOM ISLAND

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
the ruins of Muggy Kingdom.

70
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,840
There remains an old castle
from the long-dead kingdom...

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,800
which has been occupied
for several years now.

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,850
I can't believe Moria-sama died in the war!

73
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,820
You're grating on my ears.
Go somewhere else and cry.

74
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,110
How heartless are you to say
that when somebody's devastated?

75
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,710
Say something nice and bring
me a cup of hot cocoa!

76
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,030
I'm your guest!

77
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,880
I never invited you.

78
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,050
You two were living here without
asking when I wasn't here.

79
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,380
And...

80
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,550
...this article is not credible.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,470
Huh?! Then you don't think that
Moria-sama died in the war?!

82
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,600
I don't know if he's dead or alive
but at least in my memory...

83
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,820
...Moria was alive on the battlefield.

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,490
If he's not dead, why did they say he is?

85
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,610
I don't know.

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,120
H-How did you get up?!

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,290
Stay in bed - you're useless!

88
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,060
What do you plan on doing with those swords?!

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,920
Are you going to push yourself again?

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,120
You can't beat those baboons.
They'll kill you this time...

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,470
Shut up!

92
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,060
It's none of your business!

93
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,880
How could you say that to me!?

94
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,560
Can't you see that I carried
you all the way here?!

95
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,520
"Hawk-Eye"!

96
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,150
See?! You can't even walk!

97
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,700
Why are you in such a hurry? You're wounded.

98
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,680
Because you told me what happened to Luffy.

99
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,250
How can I stay still!?

100
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,780
He's still alive probably.

101
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,420
But I assume that he's been
very badly traumatized.

102
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,610
"Fire Fist" Ace...

103
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,090
...died before Straw Hat's eyes.

104
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,640
I didn't even know that such
a huge war was underway!

105
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,230
Are you sure that Luffy's
okay?! Where is he now?!

106
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,380
Tell me more!

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,190
I told you everything that I know.

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,700
Then I'm sorry for bothering you.

109
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,870
Hey, wait!

110
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,330
Even if you can make it to the shore
without bumping into those baboons,

111
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,200
how are you gonna cross the sea?

112
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,500
If you want a small boat,

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,050
there is one on the west side of this castle.

114
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,640
Thank you for everything.

115
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,930
What the hell?!

116
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,850
You fool! I'm not gonna
care about you anymore!

117
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,260
I'll never ever save you!

118
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,950
Although you just lost your brother, Luffy,

119
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,160
I know you'll keep your promise!

120
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,330
That's why I'll get there,
too, at any cost...!

121
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,750
There you are!

122
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,310
I knew you guys weren't
gonna let me go so easily.

123
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,400
Bull Demon Courageous Talons?!

124
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,830
That was Dragon Twister!

125
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,000
They're imitating my
Three-Sword Style skills!

126
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,800
Hey, you idiots!

127
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,930
How can you be so content to
copy somebody else's skills!

128
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,060
Don't mess with me!

129
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,400
Damn! He can't mess with me!

130
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,570
I've done so much for him!

131
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,030
I hope he drops dead! That'd serve him right!

132
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,710
Why don't you go and look if
you're so worried about Roronoa?

133
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,710
No way! Why should I worry about that fool?!

134
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,460
Well, I don't think that
he'd die that easily.

135
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,180
Look, he was already seriously injured
by the time Kuma blew him away!

136
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,730
So he could lose his life if he
fights against those baboons again.

137
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,270
Damn! Damn! Oh, dammit!

138
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,740
If he dies, I'll be stuck with this guy

139
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,280
who has no interest in cute stuffed animals

140
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,240
and who won't bring me a
bagel sandwich and hot cocoa!

141
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,340
I don't wanna be stuck with
that heartless "Hawk-Eye" guy!

142
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,580
I can't stand it!

143
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,100
Three Thousand Worlds!

144
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,730
What are you...

145
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,400
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame...

146
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,190
Admirable!

147
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,420
Hey, are you alive?

148
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,920
He must've gotten to the shore by now,
but I don't see any sign of him...

149
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,010
Maybe he's lost again!

150
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,850
Oni...

151
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,230
...giri!

152
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,030
Stop putting spit on it! Where
did you learn that folk remedy?!

153
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,040
These bastards, they really
make a fool out of me!

154
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,790
I'll never make it to the sea at this pace!

155
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,380
"Hawk-Eye"...

156
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,700
It's been a while since you left the castle

157
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,270
and you've only made it this far, Roronoa?

158
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,770
The boat that I gave you seems useless now.

159
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,310
Shut up!

160
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,860
I'll just treat them like planks
and swim while hanging on to them.

161
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,570
It's nice that you care about your
friend so much but they're strong.

162
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,410
They're called Humandrills - baboons
that develop by imitating humans.

163
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,210
Humandrills?

164
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,210
They'd be peace-loving, if they
grew up around peaceful humans.

165
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,260
But on this island...

166
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,300
there was a war raging until 7 years ago.

167
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,680
When I came here to live, it still
smelled like blood and smoke

168
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,480
and dead bodies littered the ground.

169
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,730
These baboons were watching those
violent humans as they grew up

170
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,450
and learned how to use weapons and
became warriors of the forest.

171
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,120
Humans can best animals by
using weapons and wisdom.

172
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,000
But when animals can use weapons,
they become this strong.

173
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,880
They make great opponents
for an arrogant young man.

174
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,130
Talking about me?

175
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,770
There's no one else.

176
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,320
It's almost sunset. Come to my castle.

177
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,550
They won't bother you there.

178
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,100
Don't tell me what to do!

179
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,230
I've got to make it to the sea!

180
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,600
I see. Do whatever you want.

181
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,360
I don't care if they're warriors
of the forest or whatever,

182
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,820
I have no time to waste now!

183
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,410
I'm gonna beat every one of them!

184
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,080
Damn! Where has he gotten to?

185
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,170
That's what I thought! He's still here!

186
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,590
H-Hey!

187
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
On the Lazy Bones Island -
Hungeria in the Grand Line...

188
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
LAZY BONES ISLAND - HUNGERIA

189
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,990
What is Satan-sama doing?

190
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,830
What happened to the ritual to
curse the Longarm Tribe to death?

191
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,080
It's so quiet.

192
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,790
Believe in him, everyone.

193
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,290
I'm sure that Satan-sama will deal

194
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,130
the diabolic Longarm Tribe a bloody blow!

195
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,470
Everybody, thank you for waiting!

196
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,470
Is the ritual finally over?

197
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,310
That's our Satan-sama!

198
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,540
See, it's finished. As
long as you have this...

199
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,000
What is that?

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,480
...you'll be okay!

201
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,530
Well... what is this?

202
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,650
--That's...
--Oh, I know!

203
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,700
Huh?

204
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,210
Listen, everybody!

205
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,880
Satan-sama made us a talisman

206
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,790
which enables us to curse
the Longarm Tribe to death!

207
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,080
Huh?

208
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,530
With this talisman,

209
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,880
even the vicious Longarm
Tribe can't come close to us!

210
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,010
They'll die as soon they see it!

211
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,390
Look, that's...

212
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,430
--I see!
--That's our Satan-sama!

213
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,320
Now everybody, let's put these
talismans up in different places!

214
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,070
Oh no, look... It's not
something like that...

215
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,320
E-E-Excuse me! Everybody!

216
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
They're all put up now!

217
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Uh-huh, good job!

218
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,710
--We're safe now!
--Thank you very much, Satan-sama!

219
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,630
--Um...
--Minister, we have a problem!

220
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,550
Th-The Longarm Tribe is here!

221
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,550
They're like moths to a flame.

222
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,560
The Longarm Tribe will be all gone by today!

223
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,560
As I was saying, um, that's not a talisman.

224
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,480
That's a musical score that I wrote!

225
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,270
Huh?

226
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,150
What?!

227
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,790
We're dead!

228
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,660
They're gonna take what little food we have

229
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,580
and men and women, and
do whatever they want...

230
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,240
We have no choice.

231
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,260
No, you have a choice!

232
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,070
Satan-sama!

233
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,330
Everybody, listen to this song.

234
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
What is this song?

235
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,730
It's filling my body with energy!

236
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,520
What the hell is this - some kind of spell?

237
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,260
It's hard to tell what those people with just

238
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,420
one joint in their arms are thinking!

239
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,800
Ah? Who are you guys?

240
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,430
From today on, we won't
allow you to abuse us!

241
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,350
Huh?

242
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,480
--We decided to fight!
--Yes! You won't take anything more from us!

243
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,480
We're gonna protect our
things with our own hands!

244
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,020
We're not afraid of anything!

245
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,320
That's it!

246
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
They look different from usual.

247
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,620
I don't know what's gotten into
them but... let's beat them up!

248
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,120
Get them!

249
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,670
Thank you very much, king
of the devils - Satan-sama!

250
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,050
I never even dreamed we'd be able
to put them in a cage one day!

251
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,140
I don't know why but when I heard
the score that you wrote...

252
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,940
...Courage and strength welled up in my heart

253
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,440
and I took up arms and fight
for the first time in my life.

254
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,240
Well, of course.

255
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,560
It ended up not working and you're
the one who beat them up finally.

256
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,450
But the ones who were abducted
came back safely - thanks to you!

257
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,290
No no, I only helped a bit.

258
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,380
Neither gods nor devils will help
those who won't fight on their own.

259
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,420
Since we're in times like these,
I wanted to make sure that...

260
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,180
...you could stand on your
own against evils without me.

261
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,680
How merciful! I think we
can change from now on!

262
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,640
Thank you very much, Satan-sama!

263
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,270
I think I did my duty by them.

264
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,860
Now... I can't believe that news.

265
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,280
Luffy-san, I hope you're okay.
It's so heart-wrenching!

266
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,910
Well - I don't have a heart, but...

267
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,210
Luffy-san, let's sing a song together!

268
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,250
I'm gonna make it there
to save your heart now!

269
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,050
Damn! I can't believe they
have a devil as a bodyguard!

270
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,380
If we could bring these unusual people
with just one arm joint back home,

271
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,100
we could make a fortune by
putting them on display.

272
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,680
Now...

273
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,190
...these Longarm Tribe have
two joints in their arm.

274
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,770
We can make a fortune by
putting them on display!

275
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,610
N-No, wait a minute!

276
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,820
You can't do that! It'd be treating
them the way they treated you!

277
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,070
Huh?

278
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,280
Everybody, listen!

279
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,160
What?! Letting them go?! Then
they'll attack us again!

280
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,750
No, they won't.

281
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,880
I made a devil's contract with them.

282
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,090
Listen, you three.

283
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,440
If you break your promise with me

284
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,970
and commit a wrongful act
in this country again,

285
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,220
I'll eat your heart!!

286
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:17,070
--Thank you for letting us go!
--We're gonna go home right away!

287
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,780
We'll never come to this country again!

288
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,820
Listen, you guys. Destroying and
stealing only generates hatred.

289
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,370
If somebody did the same in your
country, I'm sure you'd feel bad.

290
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,750
It doesn't matter if you have
one or two joints in your arms.

291
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,090
We're all the same! So let's
be nice to each other!

292
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,470
Devil-sama!

293
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,800
Here we go!

294
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,550
What?!

295
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,140
Why?! What's going on here?!

296
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,980
Let's go!

297
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,770
We don't believe in devils!

298
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,650
You're strong but not so
strong when you get tied up!

299
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:06,030
--If we bring back this skeleton that moves...
--...We can make a fortune!

300
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,370
Wait a minute! I've got somewhere to go!

301
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,830
Satan-sama!

302
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,330
It's a crisis! Satan-sama got kidnapped!

303
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,630
Everybody, get ready to summon another devil!

304
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,130
That's right! We can call
devils with our underwear!

305
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,500
Luffy-san, just sing when you feel sad!

306
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,070
That's what musicians
are for! So wait for me!

307
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,270
I will... I will be there!

308
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,570
Luffy-san, Luffy-san, before that...

309
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,800
Help me!!

310
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,960
What are you gonna do, Luffy-kun?

311
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,790
R-Rayleigh, what did you just say?!

312
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,050
--Weren't you listening?!
--That's not it!

313
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,010
I can't understand your intent!

314
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,890
You know what's going on in Luffy's mind now.

315
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,140
Depending on your answer,
I won't be able to forgive you!

316
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,690
She's right!

317
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,100
How dare you say a such thing,

318
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,280
knowing what happened to him?

319
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,610
You're a harsh person.

320
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,600
I said that it's a "suggestion."

321
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,870
You must decide, Luffy-kun,
what you want to do.

322
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,220
I don't ever wanna let my friends...

323
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,760
...go through something like that again!

324
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,310
If I do as you told me to,
I can protect my friends?

325
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,230
I think it's worth trying.

326
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,860
But you should realize
you'll have a lot to do.

327
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,030
Okay.

328
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,990
I made up my mind.

329
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,290
I'm gonna go back.

330
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,930
To Marineford!

331
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,340
After learning of Ace's death, Sanji quickly
prepares to return to the Sabaody Archipelago.

332
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,770
But then, Queen Ivan-san returns home.

333
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,680
The Kamabakka Kingdom erupts with joy!

334
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,450
Sanji finally gets to be a man again,
but a new danger is upon him!

335
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

336
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,270
"A Disaster for Sanji!
The Queen's Return to the Kingdom!"

337
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
