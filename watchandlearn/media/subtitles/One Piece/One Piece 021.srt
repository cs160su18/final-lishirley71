00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,750
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,700
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,790
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,560
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,410
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,760
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,450
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,450
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,260
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,070
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,990
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,880
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,380
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,010
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,610
Gum-Gum...

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,440
What do you mean by that?

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,450
Please reduce it to a week.

27
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,370
Don't mess with me!

28
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,620
You could've eaten it if you
took that bug out, couldn't you?

29
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,000
It took three full days to
cook it, skimming the scum...

30
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,460
I'm a customer! I'm paying you!

31
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,050
Can money... satisfy your hunger?

32
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,050
What'd you say?!

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm asking, "Can it...
satisfy your hunger?!"

34
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,460
"Unwelcome Customer!
Sanji's Food and Ghin's Debt"

35
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,320
I can't... hold it anymore...

36
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,040
Serving customers! That is "love"!
And "love" means "restaurant"!

37
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,250
The customer is king!!

38
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,210
Motto! Motto! Service motto!
Service is about pleasant greetings!

39
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,820
Welcome, ya damn crook.

40
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,680
Please never come back.

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,570
I'm terribly sorry.

42
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,320
Ten thousand berries coming in!

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,220
You look pathetic!

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,800
All right! I took a healthy dump, and
I'm in excellent shape again today!

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,400
Oh? Welcome, ya damn crook.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,940
Motto! Motto! Service motto!
The customer is...

47
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,450
Ahh! Our customer!

48
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,660
You again, Sanji! What're you
doing to our customer?!

49
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,300
Of all people, he's a Navy Lieutenant!

50
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,840
What is it, you damn cook?!

51
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,290
Don't call my name as
if I were your friend!

52
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,850
A damn cook has no right
to call me "damn cook"!

53
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,060
Restaurants can't exist
without customers!

54
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,100
Hurting our precious customer...
What do you think you're doing?!

55
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,600
What's the big deal with customers?

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,350
He treated the food carelessly.
On top of that, he insulted cooks.

57
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,780
So I taught him a lesson.

58
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,410
What's with this restaurant...

59
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,870
No restaurant should treat
its customers like this...

60
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,830
I'll shut it down... I'll shut down
this restaurant! I'll shut it down!!

61
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,960
I'll contact the government
immediately and...

62
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,340
Then I'd better finish you off here...

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,260
Stop it, Sous Chef!

64
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,430
A stuck up asshole like you

65
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,040
What're you doing?!
If you keep going at him,

66
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,040
who's too big for his britches

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,840
we'll be in a big trouble!
Stop it, Sanji!!

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,800
just pisses me off!!

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Stop it! You're going too far, Sanji!

70
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,360
So you think you're a big shot?! Huh?!

71
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,970
Oh, boy...

72
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,190
What happened?

73
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,850
What now?

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,960
Boy... that startled me...

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
O-Owner! What the heck are you doing?!

76
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,710
Oh, dammit!! The ceiling
of my restaurant...

77
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,680
It's your fault, you brat!!

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,420
You broke it yourself!

79
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,380
What're you doing, Owner?!

80
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,510
You can do that later!
Please stop, Sanji!!

81
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,120
Hey, Sanji!

82
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,940
Are you going on a rampage in
the restaurant again, you idiot?!

83
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,570
Shut up, you damn geezer!

84
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,300
What'd you say?! Who do
you think you're talking to?!

85
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,900
Are you trying to put my
restaurant out of business?!

86
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,740
You brat!!

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,200
You, too! Get out of here already!

88
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,680
What's with this restaurant?
Even the owner is like a gangster...

89
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,010
It's as if... as if...
this were a pirate ship!

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,930
You listen! The customer is king!

91
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,510
Just those who eat your
damn crappy dishes.

92
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,270
Patty, Sanji! If you wanna
fight, do it in the kitchen!

93
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,230
Are these idiots really cooks?

94
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,930
L-Lieutenant! Lieutenant Fullbody!

95
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,780
W-We've got trouble!

96
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,530
Geez... what a wild restaurant...

97
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,160
Pirate Krieg's underling escaped!

98
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,120
What?!

99
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,830
After seven of us finally captured him
to get a lead on the Krieg Pirates...

100
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,020
Can't be! When we captured him three
days ago, he was close to starving!

101
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,170
And we haven't fed him at all since!

102
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,140
K-Krieg Pirates...

103
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,470
They're the ones who're said to be
the strongest pirates in the East Blue...

104
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,060
I'm very...

105
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,490
We have a new customer.

106
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,660
He'd better not be someone who'll
go on a rampage in my place.

107
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,670
A pirate, huh?

108
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,220
Anything's fine. Bring me food.

109
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,600
This is a restaurant, right?

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,010
Welcome, ya damn crook.

111
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,610
I'll say it only one more time,
so listen good. Bring me food.

112
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,740
That cook is gonna get killed...

113
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,010
Um, sir, I'm terribly sorry,
but do you have money for that?

114
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,960
Would a bullet do?

115
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,370
So you don't have money, right?

116
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,580
What?!

117
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,050
Patty, that dumb ass!
He broke the chair...

118
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,630
What power!

119
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,050
If you can't pay for the food,
you're not a customer.

120
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,960
Good job, Cook!

121
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,770
Beat that pirate up, Patty-san!

122
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,020
Oh... Your stomach is grumbling, pirate.

123
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,570
That was a fart, you stupid
racoon dog. Just bring me food.

124
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,840
If you're not a customer,
beat it already!!

125
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,220
I-I've had enough already!

126
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,620
I don't want anything
to do with this restaurant!

127
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,630
I-I'll never come back here!

128
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,920
Now, dumb customers,
please continue your meal!

129
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,990
Please never come back.

130
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,290
Dammit! If I were in a normal
state, I wouldn't have been...

131
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,660
...mocked by someone like that...

132
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,630
Hey, are you hungry by any chance?

133
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,300
Shut up! I'm not hungry!

134
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,310
Eat it.

135
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,980
Shut up! Beat it!

136
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,020
Even when I'm down and out,
I won't take charity from others.

137
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,950
Take this food away now!

138
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,640
Stop whining and eat it already!

139
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,380
To me, anyone who's
hungry is a customer.

140
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,080
Sorry, but I'm not a customer.

141
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,990
How large and cruel the ocean is...

142
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,810
How scary it is to lose food
and water on the ocean...

143
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,930
How hard it is...

144
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,070
I can understand how a hungry
person feels more than anyone.

145
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,980
You can die for your pride if you want,

146
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,950
but if you eat and survive, don't you
think there's a future for you?

147
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,810
Sorry...

148
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,050
Sorry... Thank you... I thought I'd die.

149
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,070
I thought I was done...

150
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,230
Delicious... Delicious...

151
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,980
I've never eaten food so delicious.

152
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,070
It's damn delicious, isn't it?

153
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,410
I found a good cook!

154
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,110
Hey you, it's a good thing
that he gave you food!

155
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,670
You almost died!

156
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,290
Hey you, cook! Join my group!

157
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,420
Huh?

158
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,090
Be the cook on my pirate ship!

159
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,010
--Huh?!
--Huh?!

160
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,020
Are you a pirate?

161
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,310
Yep!

162
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,490
Why the hell did you shoot
a cannonball into this restaurant?

163
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,410
That was an accident!
A self-defense, stray shot.

164
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,920
A what now?

165
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,290
In any event, don't do anything
stupid to this restaurant.

166
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,970
The owner of this place used to be
a cook in a famous pirate group.

167
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,260
I see... So pops was a pirate...

168
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,290
To that damn geezer, this
restaurant is like his treasure...

169
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,980
On top of that, those cooks, who
came here out of admiration for him,

170
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,190
are all hot-headed just like pirates.

171
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,420
Well, they're actually perfect for
this place since pirates come and go.

172
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,820
Yeah, this restaurant is really wild.

173
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,020
Yeah. This is how it is here every day.

174
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,310
There're even customers
who come to see

175
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,620
fights between cooks
and pirates these days.

176
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,480
Because of that, the waiters
all got scared and ran away.

177
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,050
Ah, I see... That's why pops
told me to work here for a year...

178
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,840
Hey, join our group.

179
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,810
I refuse. There's a reason that
I have to work in this restaurant.

180
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,680
No! I refuse!

181
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,640
Wh-What do you mean?!

182
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,190
I refuse your refusal!

183
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,640
You're a good cook,
so let's be pirates together.

184
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,650
Hey, listen to what I say.

185
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,240
So what's that reason?

186
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,200
I don't need to tell you.

187
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,430
Huh? You just told me
to listen to what you say!

188
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,520
I'm telling you
to accept what I say!

189
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,500
I'm gonna cut you into three
pieces, you damn straw hat!

190
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,050
What'd you say?!
I'm gonna beat you up

191
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,770
if you make fun of the
straw hat, you jerkwad!

192
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,920
Sorry to interrupt...

193
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,760
--What?!
--What?!

194
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,730
I'm Ghin of the Krieg Pirates.

195
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,550
You're a pirate, too, right?
Do you have any goals?

196
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,900
I'm aiming for the One Piece.
I'm going to enter the Grand Line.

197
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,530
Given that you're looking for a cook,
it seems you have only a few members.

198
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,560
Yep. He's the fifth member.

199
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,540
Why are you counting me?!

200
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,710
Since you seem like
a nice guy, I'll warn you.

201
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,140
The Grand Line is the one
place you should avoid.

202
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,550
You're still young.
You don't need to rush.

203
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,440
The Grand Line is only a small
portion of the entire ocean.

204
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,050
If you wanna be a pirate,
there's an endless ocean out there.

205
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,640
I see... You know something
about the Grand Line?

206
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,190
No... I don't know anything...
I don't understand anything about it...

207
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,770
That's exactly why I fear it...

208
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,780
You're an underling of that Krieg,
and yet you talk so wimpy...

209
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,560
Hmm? Who's Krieg?

210
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,110
The hors d'oeuvre for
table three is ready!

211
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,020
Take it yourself.
We don't have any waiters.

212
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,140
Is it really okay, though, Patty?

213
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,760
Is what okay?

214
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,560
I hear the guy you beat up
earlier in the restaurant

215
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,610
is one of the Krieg Pirates.

216
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,300
Oh yeah, I heard.

217
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,410
"Don Krieg" is the strongest
and most evil pirate

218
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,900
in this part of the ocean.

219
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,300
That's right.

220
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,310
Hmm?

221
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,910
After all, he's the don of
a pirate fleet that controls

222
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,170
the captains of 50 pirate ships.

223
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,670
He's no less than a monster...

224
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,880
So, what's the big deal?

225
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,300
I heard that his extraordinary force
consists of more than 5,000 pirates.

226
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,520
For example, if that guy from earlier

227
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,390
told Don Krieg what
happened to him here,

228
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,220
this restaurant would
probably be crushed

229
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,640
like a large parade of
elephants stomping on ants.

230
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,360
Oh, yeah?

231
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,180
Then you're saying that
I should've just treated him?

232
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,870
That's rude to the other customers.

233
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,750
It will ruin the reputation
of the famous fighting cooks

234
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,670
at the Sea Restaurant Baratie!

235
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,780
How many pirates do you
think we've beaten off?

236
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,260
If you're that scared, just quit!

237
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,150
What'd you say?!
Oh yeah, all the waiters

238
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,520
quit because of those words of yours!

239
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,060
Patty! It's your fault
that we're this busy!

240
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,400
Ha! Those wimps were
useless from the start!

241
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,480
Go for it!

242
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,660
Carne, take him out!

243
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,910
Patty, beat him!

244
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,650
Hey, you idiots! Get to work already!

245
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,620
Yes, Owner!

246
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,540
So long, then...

247
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,500
But I'm still going to the Grand Line.

248
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,450
Yeah. Do whatever you like.

249
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm a stranger to you. I don't
have the right to try to stop you.

250
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,050
I just wanted to warn you.

251
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,890
And Sanji-san, thank you so much!

252
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,190
I owe my life to you. The food you
gave me was the most delicious.

253
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,190
Is it okay if I come back for it?

254
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,110
Any time!

255
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,940
Hey, you, chore boy!

256
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,340
Pops!

257
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,940
There you are!

258
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,370
Go, Ghin.

259
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,140
Ahh, sorry.

260
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,750
You're gonna get yelled at,
because you fed me free, right?

261
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,750
Well...

262
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,560
...there's no proof, so there's no
reason for me to be yelled at.

263
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,190
Don't ever get caught again, Ghin!

264
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,510
Thank you, Sanji-san!

265
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,980
I'll never forget your kindness!

266
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,410
Sanji! Chore boy! Get to work already!

267
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,120
Hey, table three is ready!

268
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,030
I'm Luffy!

269
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,430
I'll be the chore boy from now.
Nice to meet you all!

270
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,450
Isn't the dessert for
table six ready yet?!

271
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,940
Hey, who's responsible for that order?!

272
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,550
Isn't that you?!

273
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,890
I'm too busy right now!

274
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,370
That's because you keep spacing out!

275
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,460
What'd you say?! Wanna fight?!

276
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,170
If you have nothing to do, wash
dishes or something, chore boy!

277
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,490
Where's Sanji?

278
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,380
He's hitting on a customer
in the dining room.

279
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,770
Again?!

280
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,850
I'm already annoyed by him just
being the Sous Chef to begin with!

281
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,310
It can't be helped since he's
worked here the longest.

282
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,100
Do you know why he keeps staying here

283
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,280
when he doesn't get along with Owner?

284
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,090
He's aiming to be the next Head Chef.

285
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,950
You can tell if you watch him.

286
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,310
--Huh?
--Huh?

287
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,950
Hey, chore boy!

288
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,390
How many dishes have
you broken so far?!

289
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,850
Oh, sorry. I forgot to count.

290
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,720
That's not what I meant!
Apologize for breaking them!

291
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,970
Forget about washing
dishes. Clean that area!

292
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,220
Okay, leave it to me!

293
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,180
Don't take food!

294
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,250
That's a main dish!!

295
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,270
Oh, don't worry about it!

296
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,360
Ouch!!

297
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,350
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

298
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,740
Would you get out
of the kitchen already?!

299
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,290
You go take orders, okay?

300
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,210
Go ask what customers want
to eat! You can do it, can't you?!

301
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,020
Yes...

302
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,920
Chores're sure tiring. It must've
been a lot of work for Koby, too.

303
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,540
Hey, chore boy!

304
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,460
Ugh! You guys...

305
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,330
I hear you have to work for a year here!

306
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,420
Is it okay if we redraw
our flag for the ship?

307
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,140
Ahhh... You're eating
yummy food without me?!

308
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,240
How could you?!

309
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,310
That's our business, right, guys?

310
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,310
Take this!

311
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,770
Y-Yeah...

312
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,320
Well, it's true that
the food here is good.

313
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,270
I feel bad for you, but...

314
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,870
...drink it yourself!

315
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,250
--I can't believe you did that!
--I can't believe you did that!

316
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,550
My stomach hurts! That was nasty!

317
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,890
How noisy... Could they be his buddies?

318
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,190
Do it yourself.

319
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,790
Oh, dear ocean!

320
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,070
I thank you for today's encounter!

321
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,070
What?!

322
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,780
Oh, love, I can't bear this hardship.
Go ahead and laugh at me.

323
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,540
I'm now prepared to be a lowly
pirate or devil if I'm with you!

324
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,090
However, how tragic it is! There's
too great an obstacle between us!

325
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,000
That obstacle is me, right, Sanji?

326
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,460
Damn geezer!

327
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,430
This is a good opportunity. Why don't
you become a pirate with them?

328
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,190
You're no longer needed
at this restaurant!

329
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,170
I see...

330
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,980
That cook saved your life,

331
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,000
and you were able to come back here...

332
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,440
Is that what you're saying, Ghin?

333
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,430
Y-Yes... B-But...

334
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,600
I never imagined the main
ship was in this condition...

335
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,100
Don Krieg!

336
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,560
What?

337
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll take you there...
to the Sea Restaurant Baratie...

338
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:24,330
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

339
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:31,070
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

340
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:38,410
before someone else could
beat me to it

341
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:52,590
If the world is going to change

342
00:23:52,590 --> 00:24:06,720
before I can even attain my dream

343
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,770
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

344
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:20,100
so that my memories won't fade

345
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,900
The customer is king.

346
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,230
That's right! Smile no
matter who the customer!

347
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,280
Hey, a big fish is here!

348
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,360
--That's...
--Krieg Pirates!

349
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,260
That's a large pirate group
with a 5,000-pirate force!

350
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,910
5,000? I wonder if we
have enough chairs...

351
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,900
Idiot! They came to attack this
place! Close the restaurant!

352
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

353
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,540
"The Strongest Pirate Fleet!
Commodore Don Krieg"

354
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,050
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
