1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
High Tide

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
Edited at https://subtitletools.com

3
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

4
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

5
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

6
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered
just before his death

7
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

8
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,200
My treasure?

9
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,470
If you want it, you can have it!

10
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,820
Find it!

11
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

12
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

13
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,260
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

14
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,830
During their voyage to Fishman Island,

15
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,190
Luffy and his friends fought a fierce battle
against Duval and the Flying Fish Riders.

16
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,900
Curse you Straw Hats!

17
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,480
In response to Duval's unjustified hatred,

18
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,860
Sanji's outrage reached its peak.

19
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,690
Œil!

20
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,470
Nez!

21
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,160
Joue! Bouche! Dents!

22
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,350
Menton!

23
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,290
Parage...

24
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,830
Shot!

25
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,470
"Landing on the Way to Fishman
Island! The Sabaody Archipelago!"

26
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,330
Head! Head!

27
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,640
Where are you?!

28
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,580
Head!

29
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,910
Are you all right, Head?!

30
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,210
He's...

31
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,890
Damn, he's all beat up.

32
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,880
Head, are you alive?

33
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,720
Head!

34
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,470
Damn it...

35
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,230
I finally had Black Foot
right where I wanted him!

36
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,430
Huh? What is it?

37
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,080
Why are you all gawking at me?

38
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,410
Head, please stay calm and look at this.

39
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,290
Th-This is... Wh-Wha—

40
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,250
What happened to me?!

41
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,550
Yum!

42
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,240
Mmm, this is great!

43
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,490
See? Hatchin's takoyaki is
the best in the world, right?

44
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,400
I can't stop! I can't put them down!

45
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,070
This takoyaki is incredible!

46
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,780
Ow! Hot! Hot! Hot!

47
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,170
It really is good. What is this stuff?

48
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,020
The deep flavor of this sauce...

49
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,140
And it's impressive that he
runs the business from a ship.

50
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,780
This is my first experience
with the culture of takoyaki.

51
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,270
It is delicious!

52
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,900
I could stuff my cheeks with this!

53
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,140
Uh, not that I have cheeks...

54
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,450
You can eat all you like for free today!

55
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,150
This is to thank you all for saving us.

56
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,520
These are made with broth,
and these have mochi in them.

57
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,490
Careful, they're hot!

58
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,530
So...

59
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,490
How about you, um... Nami?

60
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,610
Er, um... H-How does it taste?

61
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,720
This doesn't mean I'm going
to forgive you for anything.

62
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,620
No, of course not! That's not why I asked!

63
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,490
I really just wondered how
you liked the taste...

64
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,070
Nami...

65
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,780
They're really tasty!

66
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,330
I see, I see!

67
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,290
I'm glad! I'm so glad to hear that!

68
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay, you guys, eat up! Have all you like!

69
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,260
Yeah! Keep 'em coming!
We'll eat every last one!

70
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,540
Hey! You guys!

71
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,850
Young Master!

72
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,150
Who's that?

73
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,200
That voice...

74
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,240
Wait up!

75
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,870
You can't leave without saying goodbye!

76
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,790
Who's that?

77
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,530
I'm Handsome— Oh, my mistake.

78
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm Duval!

79
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,240
Is that what he looked like?

80
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,200
I altered his bone structure.

81
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,440
Now he can't complain to me again.

82
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,040
Wow, Master Black Foot!

83
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,320
When I woke up after you kicked the
crap out of me, were we ever surprised!

84
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,260
You made me this handsome!

85
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,830
I'm just enchanted!

86
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,370
The ladies won't be able ignore this!

87
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,260
This is truly...

88
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,150
seeing life through rose-colored lenses!

89
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,300
I'd love to head straight back
to the country and relax,

90
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,970
but if I left without thanking my saviors,
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night!

91
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,340
It's your first time in these waters, right?

92
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,030
If there's any way we can help
you, just ask us anything!

93
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,770
Don't wink if you're not used to it.

94
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,050
Well, if you have no complaints,
that's enough for me.

95
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,090
If I were to request something, it'd be
that you never show up around us aga—

96
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,450
Beautiful. Too beautiful.

97
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,290
Are you listening?!

98
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,160
I should ride a white horse.

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
Hey, you!

100
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,090
Head, Head! You need to listen!

101
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,550
Oh, right...

102
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,430
What? Handsome?

103
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,890
I didn't say anything like that!

104
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,490
Want me to make you look
like that scribble again?!

105
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,780
I'm embarrassed, but I accept...

106
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,760
your blown kiss!

107
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
Whoo, whoo!

108
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,200
I didn't blow a kiss! I just
wiped sauce off my lips!

109
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,360
What kind of optimistic
delusion are you seeing?!

110
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,980
Oh, mirror, mirror! Is the
most handsome man of all me?

111
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,280
A single-choice quiz?!

112
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,060
We get that you're handsome,

113
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,670
but you were dumb to start
with, so you're still hopeless.

114
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,170
Ah. You're jealous?

115
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,630
I am not!

116
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,590
Don't bother, Usopp! You're
no match for his personality!

117
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Well, Young Master, this is
my Transponder Snail number.

118
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,310
Call me anytime!

119
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,120
I'll definitely help you all out!

120
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,360
I really caused you a lot of trouble.

121
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Sorry you all got mixed up in this.

122
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,860
Just stop winking.

123
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,750
Bye, now!

124
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,070
Let's go, Rosy Life Riders!

125
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,330
Yes, Handsome!

126
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,970
So leave already.

127
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,460
Whew, thanks for the feast!

128
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,720
Man, I'm stuffed! This is bliss!

129
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,010
That was tasty!

130
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,590
I can't eat any more...

131
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,010
I'm exhausted.

132
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,730
You guys sure eat a lot.

133
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,950
I should've expected that of the Straw Hats.

134
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,140
I wish I had six more arms.

135
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,650
Good work, Hatchin.

136
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,570
Looks like everyone is happy.

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,780
Are they? Then I'm happy, too.

138
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,010
It's been a wonderful afternoon, Master.

139
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,240
I'm also more than happy with
my first takoyaki experience.

140
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,290
Ah, pardon me.

141
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,190
Everything about that is disgusting!

142
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,630
Hey, octopus and starfish and Camie-chan!

143
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,450
If you're taking a break,
come up to the deck.

144
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,860
I'll serve you tea, too.

145
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,600
Sure!

146
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,810
This tea is delicious.

147
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,370
We're on the right path.

148
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,790
Our destination is the Sabaody Archipelago.

149
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,490
Do we have to go there
to get to Fishman Island?

150
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,760
We fishmen and mermaids can
get there easily by diving,

151
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,870
but you're humans, so if you
dive, the pressure will kill you.

152
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,500
Yeah, we barely held out
even in the submarine.

153
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,250
The hull seems to be creaking...

154
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,010
Yes, because...

155
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,530
We're more than 5,000 meters under.

156
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,080
Ah, so that's why.

157
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,350
Wait! That's a bad idea!
The pressure will crush us!

158
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,190
How are we gonna get to
the bottom of the sea?

159
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,140
Okay, attention!

160
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,470
It looks like you guys don't have a clue,

161
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,840
so I'll tell you all you need
to know about these seas.

162
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,930
What? Who's going to do that?

163
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,280
That would be...

164
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,370
Me!

165
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,340
Huh?

166
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,370
Um, please listen...

167
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,960
As I was saying, there are two routes
that can take you to the new world.

168
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,830
But for outlaws like you
guys, only one is possible.

169
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,960
Why?

170
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,620
Because...

171
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,270
One of them, at the request
of the World Government,

172
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,560
involves crossing the city built on top
of the Red Line, the holy land Marie Jois.

173
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,720
What?

174
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,610
Naturally, there's no way they'd grant
permission for pirates to cross.

175
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,450
We'd have to walk over the Red Line?

176
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,370
What would we do with the ship, then?

177
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,320
You'd have to abandon your ship and
buy a similar one on the other side.

178
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,220
Abandon the ship?!

179
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,110
Yeah. It costs money, and
getting permission takes time,

180
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,530
but it's safe, so that's what most do.

181
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,550
However!

182
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,800
For the route you'll take,
you can keep your ship!

183
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,050
It's called...

184
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,020
The Sea Floor Route Via Fishman Island!

185
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,060
But the Sea Floor Route has many dangers.

186
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,210
Huh? Camie? Camie?

187
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,210
What do you mean?

188
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,130
I didn't pass you the baton...

189
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,030
Many ships that use it are eaten
whole by sea monsters and sea kings.

190
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,480
I see. That is dangerous.

191
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,550
Camie? Camie?

192
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,160
Can you hear me?

193
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,160
You see?

194
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,210
I don't think I want to
go to Fishman Island...

195
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,120
Me, either...

196
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,830
Hang on, Camie. Did you say
ships have been eaten whole?

197
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,500
Huh? Yeah.

198
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,090
What kind of ship do we use
to get to the sea floor?

199
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,520
This ship.

200
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,800
What?

201
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,210
Hey, this ship can't go underwater.

202
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,070
No, it'll be fine.

203
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,680
And that big wall that goes
around the world, the Red Line,

204
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,450
has a small hole in just one spot.

205
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,980
Oh, it's a big hole from
our perspective, though.

206
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,190
That's where Fishman Island is!

207
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,710
It's basically directly below Marie Jois.

208
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,790
You dive about 10,000
meters down to get there.

209
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,670
That far?

210
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,100
It's a great place!

211
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,920
I think the sky island was 10,000
meters in the air, too...

212
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,340
But how do we get to the
sea floor in this ship?

213
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,460
You'll get a coating on your ship
at the island we're heading to now.

214
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,700
A coating?

215
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,050
You'll see once it's on.

216
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,330
All right, look ahead!

217
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,520
We're here, everyone!

218
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,110
Wow! It's beautiful!

219
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,030
What is that?!

220
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,280
There's stuff flying around...

221
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,660
My goodness!

222
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,160
It's like a fantasy.

223
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,660
Bubbles?

224
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,000
This is...

225
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,550
The Sabaody Archipelago!

226
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,530
Awesome!

227
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,130
There are bubbles flying everywhere!

228
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,840
So pretty...

229
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,460
Wow!

230
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,590
What is all this, though?

231
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,660
They're floating from the ground to the sky.

232
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,110
Who's blowing them?

233
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,560
They're emitted by the island.

234
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,850
Emitted? You mean...

235
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,600
Really? Why?

236
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,210
May I ask a question?

237
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,430
Sorry to interrupt.

238
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,210
Is the Log Pose all right?

239
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,610
Oh, yeah...

240
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,410
It's pointing toward
Fishman Island now, but...

241
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,160
Hey, this island won't overwrite
the Log Pose, will it?

242
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,770
No need to worry about that.

243
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,080
The Sabaody Archipelago is
really a bunch of trees.

244
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,900
It has no magnetic force.

245
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,040
Oh...

246
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,130
So these aren't islands, then?

247
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,270
Well, have you heard of
trees called "mangroves"?

248
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,510
Mangroves?

249
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,390
The kind that expose and cover
their roots depending on the tides?

250
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,180
That's right.

251
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,350
Though, on this island, their
roots are exposed all the time.

252
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,760
The Sabaody Archipelago is home
to the world's biggest mangroves,

253
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,230
the Hustle Muscle Mangroves.

254
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,510
Hustle Muscle Mangroves?

255
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,070
Sounds like they've got a lot of hustle!

256
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,070
I do, too!

257
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,690
There are a total of 79 trees.

258
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,360
Each one is an island with
its own towns and facilities.

259
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,000
They are collectively called
the Sabaody Archipelago.

260
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,710
There are numbers written on the trees.

261
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,590
Yes, each of the 79 trees
is marked with a number.

262
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,480
The one straight ahead, Grove
#44, is the commercial entrance,

263
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,790
so let's dock the ship a bit further in.

264
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,360
The roots are even bigger up close!

265
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,110
Wow...

266
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,930
It's pitch black inside them.

267
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,200
How remarkable!

268
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,700
Is that a bridge?

269
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,190
Yeah, all the islands are connected
with bridges like that.

270
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,410
Ah, I see!

271
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,810
Okay, we're here!

272
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,560
This is Grove #41. Let's dock here.

273
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,780
I'm first!

274
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,400
Okay, everyone, remember
the number of this island!

275
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,980
As I said before, all the islands
are connected by bridges,

276
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,070
so if you remember the
number, you won't get lost.

277
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,450
I know someone who'd still get lost.

278
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,290
Yeah, me too.

279
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,360
Huh? What?

280
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,990
What?!

281
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,650
It popped out of the ground! Cool!

282
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,420
Amazing!

283
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,470
I'm on!

284
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,140
It's not popping.

285
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,470
That looks fun!

286
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,440
These bubbles really are mysterious.

287
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
How do they work?

288
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,670
The roots of Hustle Muscle Mangroves
secret a special natural resin.

289
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,290
Gross! It's all sticky!

290
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,220
Don't wipe it on me!

291
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,420
That resin expands into bubbles
when the roots breathe.

292
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,980
I get it...

293
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,460
So that's how they float up to the sky.

294
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,000
So this scenery is all natural?

295
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,370
Hey!

296
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,600
Whoa, Luffy! When did you get up that high?!

297
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,850
I can see an amusement park over there!

298
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,640
Let's go! I wanna ride the ferris wheel!

299
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,430
An amusement park?!

300
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,480
That's Sabaody Park.

301
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,690
A ferris wheel sounds fun...

302
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,230
It was always my dream to ride one.

303
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,440
Your dream? Why don't you just ride one?

304
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,040
Don't be a fool! You can't, Camie!

305
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,370
Yeah, I know.

306
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,760
I want to ride it, too... Can I not?

307
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,420
I'm really high up!

308
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,820
What's going on?

309
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,910
They're suddenly popping!

310
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,990
Luffy-chin!

311
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,080
Oh, no! Are you okay?!

312
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,540
It's fine, Camie-chan.

313
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,910
No need to worry about him.

314
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,460
Man, I was really stuck!

315
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,970
See?

316
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,930
By the way, Hachi, what did
we come to this island for?

317
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,730
You said something about a
coating for the ship earlier.

318
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,910
Right. We'll go see a coating craftsman

319
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,460
and have your ship coated in resin.

320
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,190
In simple terms, that'll allow
your ship to go underwater.

321
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,740
For real?

322
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,310
That's the only way you humans
can get to Fishman Island.

323
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,710
But if you get an unskilled
coating craftsman,

324
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,670
the ship and its passengers will be
crushed underwater, and that's the end.

325
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,170
I know just one craftsman that you
can trust, so I'll take you to him.

326
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,260
When all is said and done,
the octopus is a good man.

327
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,910
No, a good octopus!

328
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,430
In exchange...

329
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,800
I want you to keep one promise for me.

330
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,810
Sure! What is it?

331
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,730
Sometimes, there are World
Nobles walking around in town.

332
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,100
World Nobles?

333
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,950
Who are they?

334
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,120
Residents of the holy land Marie Jois.

335
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,630
Hmm...

336
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,290
So, what about them?

337
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,050
No matter what may happen in town,

338
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,290
promise me that you will
not defy the World Nobles.

339
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,790
Huh?

340
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,550
No matter what happens?

341
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,230
You mean...

342
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,180
Understand?

343
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,980
Even if someone is killed before your eyes,

344
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,030
you must pretend you saw nothing.

345
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,430
I'll say it once more.

346
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,430
You must pretend

347
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,200
you saw nothing!

348
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,890
The Sabaody Archipelago is fun!

349
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,050
There's so much stuff I've never seen before!

350
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,070
Hey! Here comes someone
wearing a bubble on his head!

351
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,830
There's a dog with a bubble on its head, too!

352
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,100
Oh, no! Everyone get on your knees!

353
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,730
Don't look them in the eyes!

354
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,030
On the next episode of One Piece!

355
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,630
"Tyranny! The Roles of Sabaody,
the Celestial Dragons"

356
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,790
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
