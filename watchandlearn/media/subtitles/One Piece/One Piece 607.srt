2
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,680
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,420
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,200
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,980
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,340
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,410
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,650
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

14
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,210
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,030
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,350
an island with two parts,
one burning, the other frozen

17
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,380
and were held captive by
Caesar Clown who rules the island

18
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,580
and were exposed to Shinokuni,
a weapon of mass destruction.

19
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,080
But they were reunited with
their crew thanks to their ally -

20
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,510
a Warlord - Trafalgar Law's tactful maneuvers

21
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,410
and now they are heading for R Building - gate 66,

22
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,130
the only door to the path of escape.

23
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,130
Meanwhile, Vice Admiral Vergo,
the base commander of the G-5,

24
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,050
appeared in front of Tashigi
and the others and...

25
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,730
Captain Tashigi,
you're gonna love this!

26
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,480
Reinforcements have arrived!

27
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,020
The Vice Admiral came to help!

28
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,450
Vergo!

29
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,770
Vice Admiral Smo-yan

30
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,240
and Vice Admiral Vergo!

31
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,530
We have both key figures
of the G-5 here!

32
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,510
We're invincible now!

33
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,470
No...

34
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,700
Yeah! Now we're safe!

35
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,140
Run,

36
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,420
everybody...

37
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,180
Run!

38
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,650
V-Vice Admiral Vergo,

39
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,530
did they do something wrong?!

40
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,250
Even if they needed to be punished,

41
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,870
your Finger Pistol could kill them...

42
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,790
Everybody, back away!

43
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,170
He is not the man
that you used to know!

44
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,880
For a long time, he has been...

45
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,630
Captain-chan!

46
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,480
You're unforgivable,
you impostor!

47
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,660
Please stop!

48
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,630
Help us,

49
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,570
Smoker-san!

50
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,930
A lady is...

51
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,330
Who is it?!

52
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,080
...in need!

53
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,380
I heard the sound of...

54
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,260
...a woman's tears falling.

55
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,210
Ready?

56
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,740
No!

57
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,960
Wait a second!

58
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,070
You...

59
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,070
I've been running so fast that
the friction has burned the floor!

60
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,930
I'm catching my breath now.

61
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,450
Hey, I didn't say "Okay"!

62
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,650
Listen,

63
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,500
Vergo is my enemy!

64
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,480
I know!

65
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,500
My enemy is Caesar!

66
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,580
Keep your hands off of him!

67
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,020
Oh, it's my enemy!

68
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,640
I won't let you get away this time!

69
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,930
Caesar!

70
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,820
"A Fierce Battle Gets Heated!
Luffy vs. Caesar!"

71
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,250
White Chase-ya.

72
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,220
You need to keep your
hands off of Caesar.

73
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,890
I'll be at a disadvantage
once we take advantage

74
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,640
of possessing each other's hearts.

75
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,200
Until I get my heart back from Vergo,

76
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,100
you can't do whatever you like.

77
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,840
I want you to follow my orders

78
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,530
while you're on the island.

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,580
Understood?

80
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,270
I took the shortest way...

81
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,080
…as quickly as I could, I thought!

82
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,700
Where is he?!

83
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,330
Vergo!

84
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,770
Damn! You're so annoying!

85
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,300
I got ya!

86
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,470
No, you didn't!

87
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,200
Flammable Type!

88
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,140
What?!

89
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,740
Miok Gas!

90
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,240
Straw Hat!

91
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,780
Why are you attacking me?!

92
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,370
I don't know yet!

93
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,350
But I've been told something fun would begin

94
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,330
if I kidnap you!

95
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,750
You formed an alliance
with Law, didn't you?

96
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,210
Did he tell you to do that?

97
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,800
You can't trust him!

98
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm sure he'll betray you!

99
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,460
Don't do it!

100
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,340
You can't tell me...

101
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,980
...what to do!

102
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,920
Do you still wanna get hurt,
rubber bastard?!

103
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,850
Karakuni!

104
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,100
I can't breathe again!

105
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,860
Yes! That's because
I removed the oxygen!

106
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,600
You can't get me with
such a desperate attack!

107
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,380
So this is the distance I need.

108
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,440
That's right!

109
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,930
It's only in a certain range
that you can't breathe!

110
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,640
But are you sure
you can keep that distance?

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,770
That's all I needed to know!

112
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,920
Second Gear!

113
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,710
Gum-Gum...

114
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
I won't let you do it!

115
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,710
...Jet Pistol!

116
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,540
Th-That was fast!

117
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,790
Ouch, you bastard!

118
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,320
But...

119
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,340
...if you come closer,
you can't breathe!

120
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,730
Again!

121
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,180
Is it painful?!

122
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,590
Look! Here is the oxygen!

123
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,270
Blue Sword!

124
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,150
I can manipulate gases.

125
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,250
Even if you're immune to poison gas,

126
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,030
there are still tons of ways to attack you!

127
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,060
How annoying!

128
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,460
That technique makes me
unable to breathe.

129
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,620
Again!

130
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,040
Now, prepare to be burned and sliced!

131
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,760
Gum-Gum...

132
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,470
Gastanet!

133
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,650
That was close!

134
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,140
Again!

135
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,350
Go to hell, Straw Hat!

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,270
What happened?

137
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,950
THE PASSAGE BETWEEN BUILDING A AND B

138
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,970
Hurry up!

139
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,530
The gate is closing!

140
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,990
Run!

141
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,140
You're a pirate.

142
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,120
Why are you doing this?

143
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
I have to teach an asshole like you

144
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,160
who would hurt a lady,
proper "table manners."

145
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,540
That's my style.

146
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,170
I'm too busy to be
bothered with your crap.

147
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,570
He's "Black Foot"
of the Straw Hats!

148
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,270
Why did he help us?

149
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,440
"Black Foot."

150
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,200
Flanchet...

151
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,950
...Strike!

152
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,330
He's strong!

153
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,220
INSIDE OF B BUILDING THE
BROWNBEARD EXPRESS AND ITS RIDERS

154
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,990
Hey hey, that dragon
is out of control!

155
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,020
He's dangerous!

156
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,480
He does look violent.

157
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,840
Brownbeard-cchi, run faster!

158
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,130
This is the fastest I can run!

159
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,060
Run yourself if you don't like it!

160
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,810
He's coming!

161
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,410
The fire he breathes looks hot.

162
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,620
Don't say it so coolly!

163
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,110
Brook, do something!

164
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,020
What?

165
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah! We're counting on you!

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,830
What?!

167
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,410
Wh-Wh-Why me?!

168
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,540
I'm scared of the dragon, too!

169
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,750
Just do it now!

170
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,140
You're the oldest!

171
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,730
That's right! You should
respect your elders!

172
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,840
What?!

173
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,770
D BUILDING - IN FRONT OF THE
"SAD" MANUFACTURING ROOM

174
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,240
Hey, we have a problem!

175
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,850
What is it?

176
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,980
The Navy soldiers and the
Straw Hats entered B Building!

177
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,910
Then they'll get to D Building soon?

178
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,490
Don't worry!

179
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,820
Nobody can get to D Building...

180
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,830
Who is it?

181
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,370
Y-You're...

182
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,810
Trafalgar Law!

183
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,240
What's going on?!

184
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,310
Why is he here?!

185
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,480
Who cares!

186
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,410
He's a traitor anyway!

187
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,600
Room.

188
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,950
What?!

189
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,150
What's this?!
What happened?!

190
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,330
What the hell?!
What did you do?! Hey!

191
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,910
You can't run, Straw Hat!

192
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,330
I can't breathe!

193
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,590
He's so persistent!

194
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,850
Now I can breathe!

195
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,260
I'll steal your breath!

196
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,330
You can't breathe, can you?!

197
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,140
You're slowing down, Straw Hat!

198
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,900
There! There! There!
There! There! There!

199
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,450
There! There! There!
There! There! There!

200
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,490
There! There!

201
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,330
Die already,

202
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,660
Straw Hat!

203
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey you!

204
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,290
Stay away from me!

205
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,600
How annoying!

206
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,540
You Haki user!

207
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,700
I have to catch him soon.

208
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,200
Before I get choked to death!

209
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,680
Oh yeah, Straw Hat.

210
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,540
You want to catch me, don't you?

211
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm afraid it's impossible!

212
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,180
No matter how strong you are,

213
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,960
once I remove the oxygen,

214
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,550
you won't be able to breathe
and will quickly die!

215
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,730
So,

216
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,470
catch me if you can!

217
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,330
"Black Foot" of the Straw Hats

218
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,620
is fighting against the Vergo impostor!

219
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,860
We got to back him up!

220
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,610
What are you guys doing?!

221
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,490
You better run already!

222
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,230
They're trying to block your way
and let the poison gas flow in again!

223
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,130
What?!

224
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,640
See? I told you!

225
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,800
The deadly gas is flowing in!

226
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,770
Run!

227
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,020
I see. So...

228
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,050
...he's made out of iron or something.

229
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,060
Stay out of this.

230
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,320
It's our problem.

231
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,610
You're the type of guy that
our captain hates the most.

232
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,040
He's...

233
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,050
...quite strong!

234
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,300
Hey, "Black Foot"!

235
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,210
The gate is gonna close!

236
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,350
Come to this side already!

237
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,210
The poison gas is right behind you!

238
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,350
Hurry up!

239
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,830
Why don't you give up
already, Straw Hat?!

240
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,130
You have two options.

241
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,920
Either you leave this room with
your tail between your legs...

242
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
...or face complete immolation.

243
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,870
I want to show the brokers
Shinokuni's power in this experiment!

244
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,980
Killing you by fire is less than ideal!

245
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,740
Karakuni!

246
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,200
I can't breathe again!

247
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,050
Straw Hat, I'll let you go for now!

248
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,370
So just...

249
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,510
I will catch you!

250
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,120
You want to die, don't you?

251
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,940
If I can't breathe,

252
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,390
I'll kick your ass in one breath!

253
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,610
Huh?

254
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,100
What are you talking about?

255
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,100
Armament Hardening!

256
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,620
It's no use!

257
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,650
I'll give you the death
you've chosen for yourself!

258
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,190
Go to hell, Straw Hat!

259
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,080
Gum-Gum...

260
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,750
...Jet Gatling!

261
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,290
What's this?!

262
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,320
A wall?!

263
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,580
Kamakura.

264
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,670
I'm impressed.

265
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,680
Only you could break this wall!

266
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,270
Are you a Devil Fruit eater?

267
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,190
Dammit! You rubber bastard!

268
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,510
Master, you must go.

269
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,260
This fight is meaningless.

270
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,230
You're right.

271
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,750
We're in the middle of
the important demonstration!

272
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,720
What are you doing?!

273
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,660
Are you gonna run?!

274
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,390
Goodbye, Straw Hat!

275
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,070
Be as wild as you want!

276
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,130
I already have an idea of how to make
you people test subjects without fail!

277
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,020
Look forward to it!

278
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,840
Wait!

279
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,830
I won't let you go after him.

280
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,470
If anything happens to the Master,

281
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,920
Joker will kill me.

282
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,690
That's the bird guy that
I saw in the war, isn't it?!

283
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,610
Who is he?!

284
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,910
Hey, what's going on here?!

285
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,210
Trafalgar?!

286
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,390
This is bad!

287
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,170
Do an emergency broadcast to all buildings!

288
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:27,890
Hurry!

289
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,850
Okay!

290
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,390
This is D Building! This is D Building!

291
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,600
This is an emergency broadcast

292
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,230
to all buildings of the Third Laboratory!

293
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,840
What's this?!

294
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,320
This is D Building!

295
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,020
This is an emergency broadcast--

296
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,670
to all buildings of the Third Laboratory!

297
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,090
The member of the Seven Warlords -

298
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,320
Trafalgar Law has...

299
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,620
...just entered into the

300
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,140
SAD manufacturing room!

301
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,690
What?!

302
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,750
Is that fool out of his mind?!

303
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,090
Once he opens that box,

304
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,210
there'll be irreversible
consequences even he can't avoid!

305
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,300
Is he...

306
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,180
Now it all makes sense.

307
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,500
Wh-What the...

308
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,230
There's another problem!

309
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,870
He wants to kidnap the
Master and wants SAD to be...

310
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,990
Now I know what you guys are going for.

311
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,100
Vergo!

312
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,660
Law...

313
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,380
He formed an alliance
with Straw Hat for defense.

314
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,640
He joined the Warlords
to get to that room.

315
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,100
That brat!

316
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,250
He has a worst scenario in mind!

317
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,080
Is he trying to...

318
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,150
...ruin the New World?!

319
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,480
Law breaks into the SAD manufacturing room.

320
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,270
He finally commences his plan that will shake up the entire New World.

321
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,140
But just then...

322
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,460
...the vile member of the Seven Warlords...

323
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,880
...who has been manipulating Punk Hazard from the shadows...

324
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,950
...finally breaks his Silence!

325
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

326
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,400
"A Mastermind Underground!
Doflamingo Makes His Move!"

327
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
