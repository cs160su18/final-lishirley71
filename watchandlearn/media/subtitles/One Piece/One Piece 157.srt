00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,650
Gum-Gum...

20
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,860
...Fireworks!!

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,220
They defeated...

22
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,500
...the White Berets!

23
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,110
You fools!

24
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,640
You should've just behaved
and done what I told you to.

25
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,020
We, the White Berets, are the gentlest
upholders of the law in God's Land.

26
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,570
However, they are not as nice as we are!

27
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,020
You are now 2nd degree criminals!

28
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,920
No matter if you cry or scream...

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,090
...you'll be judged...

30
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,010
...by the priests of Upper Yard!!

31
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,120
Heso!!

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,480
"Is Escape Possible?!
God's Challenge is Set in Motion"

33
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,050
What's their problem?

34
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,590
More importantly, we were tricked!

35
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,860
That old lady said it was
okay to pass through.

36
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,970
And when we do,
they say we entered illegally?!

37
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,400
That's fraud! I'll sue for this!

38
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,470
Exactly...

39
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,740
Of course, even if we were told,
"Don't pass through,"

40
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,910
we would've entered by force anyway.

41
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,920
Shut up!

42
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,820
In any case, you are in big trouble.

43
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,880
Since you've become
2nd degree criminals, we can't...

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,160
...help you.

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,460
Why are you talking to us
from way over there?!

46
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,300
Well, what's the fuss?

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,270
We're used to being pursued.

48
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,360
More importantly, why did you come back?

49
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,480
Huh?!

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,530
We were finally about to go to that place
that we're never to enter for a big adventu--

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,060
err... no, to look for you!

52
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,530
You're really easy to figure out.

53
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,660
What big adventure?!

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,700
I told you, didn't I?!

55
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,910
You can say that because you haven't seen

56
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,710
how scary those people on that island are!

57
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,080
It's true that we don't know
if this guy is God or what,

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,860
but his supernatural powers are the real thing!

59
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,880
I will never go back to...

60
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,810
...that island!!

61
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,380
Then, you can just wait here while we go.

62
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,710
No way, they're gonna come after me!

63
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,320
We have to leave this place!

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,130
Leave here?! Are you nuts?!

65
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,830
Which is more important
to you, adventure or life?!

66
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,620
Life! Then money!

67
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,060
Oh! Then, next would be me?!

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,080
Shut it!

69
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,970
But it's true.

70
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,520
Come to think of it, we were desperately
trying to reach this sky island,

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,310
so we weren't thinking at all
about how to go back.

72
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,910
Say, is there a way for us to go back safely?

73
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,660
Can we go back to the Blue Sea?

74
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,180
There is a way,

75
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,660
though at this point,
I can no longer say it's safe...

76
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,100
...if you go to Cloud End,
the farthest edge of the clouds.

77
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,930
Cloud End? How do we get there?

78
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,550
Cloud End is in the far east.

79
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,900
To get there, you need to go
down to the White Sea first.

80
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
Good!

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,840
Then, we can go back down
to our sea from there, right?

82
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,910
No! I'm not going back!

83
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,640
Hey, do you wanna stay here
and get sentenced to death?

84
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,750
In any case, if we stay here,
it'll cause trouble for Conis and her dad.

85
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,210
Oh, it's no trouble...

86
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,520
Well, even if we run away, we may
not be able to get away from them.

87
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,660
If that's the case, no matter where
we are in Skypiea, it'll be the same.

88
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,990
Since they know our whereabouts,
we'd better leave here right away!

89
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,680
Now, everyone! Let's set sail!

90
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,350
Conis! Mister! Thanks for everything!

91
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,960
Oh, yeah!

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,990
Hey, Luffy!

93
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,570
Hey, old guy!

94
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,310
What is it?

95
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,360
Can I take all the leftover
food from earlier with me?

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
Yes, of course.

97
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
Alright! Sanji, prepare some lunch boxes!

98
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,650
He's on the ball.

99
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,880
In that case, can I ask you a favor as well?

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,310
You're an engineer, right, old guy?

101
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Would you give me some
fixtures for the ship repair?

102
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,440
Sure, no problem.

103
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,300
Then, let's go to our house again.

104
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,630
Hey! Where're you guys going?!

105
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm gonna go get some food from them!

106
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,140
You guys go on ahead and prepare
the ship for our adventure!

107
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,810
He's definitely planning to go there.

108
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,830
Those guys're really scary!

109
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,400
Who cares? I don't care either way.

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,420
Don't take it out on me.

111
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,090
Chopper, you're on my side... aren't you?!

112
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,370
--What?!
--Don't threaten him!

113
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,090
Heavy Point!

114
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,560
I was about to drop a rope ladder.

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,330
Oops.

116
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,400
You realize that there's no
persuading Luffy, don't you?

117
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,560
Even if we all get together
and protest, he won't listen.

118
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,680
Fine! Then, I'll stay here.

119
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,350
Hm? Go right ahead.

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,070
Go right ahead?!

121
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,030
Hey, I'll be killed by those creeps!

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,680
Ah? Then so be it.

123
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,000
How dare you...?!

124
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,580
Robin,

125
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,990
why don't you and I beat Luffy together?

126
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,240
That's impossible.

127
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,740
I guess we've got a better chance
taking on those creeps, huh?

128
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,000
Those White Berets must be
gathering other members by now.

129
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,520
Come after you? How foolish!

130
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,750
God and his priests are as
immovable as a mountain.

131
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,800
They simply wait on the sacred ground
for those to be judged to come.

132
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,010
When you weigh anchor, your ordeal starts.

133
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,610
You'll be led...

134
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,900
...to the forbidden sacred ground...

135
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,080
Upper Yard!

136
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,740
Excuse me, I'd like to discuss
something with you all.

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,330
Hmm?

138
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,850
So there's a special cloud current that
can take us down to the White Sea?

139
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,270
Yes. By getting on the cloud,

140
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,650
you can cross the vast ocean
and go to the White Sea.

141
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,420
And you can also get to
Cloud End without getting lost.

142
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,440
Really?!

143
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,330
As long as you get on the current,
no one can chase after you.

144
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,440
If we don't tell Luffy and get
the Going Merry on that current...

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,210
By the time he notices, it'll be too late, huh?

146
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,740
But that doesn't mean he'll give up on it.

147
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,130
I can guide you to the entrance
of that current riding a waver.

148
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,380
Now all we need to do is
keep that fool from noticing.

149
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,090
We'll take care of that part.

150
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,630
Then please weigh anchor and wait for me.

151
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,640
Okay.

152
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,490
I really appreciate it, Conis.

153
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,100
No problem.

154
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,900
This is good!

155
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,530
Hey, don't eat our lunch!

156
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,300
There's a lot, so don't hold back.

157
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,260
You're the one who should hold back.

158
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,810
Conis, give me some tea!

159
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,310
Do it yourself!

160
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,490
Oh? Conis-chan's not here.

161
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,450
Looks like she went to bid a
fond farewell to the others.

162
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,540
I brought some tea, if you'd like some.

163
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,460
So, you're the shipwright for that ship?

164
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,090
Hmm? No, I'm not. I'm a sniper.

165
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,140
Oh, that's wonderful!

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,310
Right? Our ship still
doesn't have a shipwright.

167
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,300
Well, how should I put it?

168
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,170
Since I'm almighty and skillful in everything,

169
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,370
everyone depends on me!

170
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,870
It's a lot of work.

171
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,340
That ship just wouldn't function without me.

172
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,770
Although I'm a sniper,
it's like I'm also co-captain.

173
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,580
And, everyone calls me, "Captain Usopp"!

174
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,500
Oh, dear! This color arrangement
is clearly done by a professional!

175
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,720
Oh, yeah! Arranging food is art.

176
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,400
See you later, Conis!

177
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,970
Heso!

178
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,340
I can finally see rays of hope.

179
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,330
For a while there, I was worried.

180
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,190
But I wonder if there really is such a current...

181
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,230
What?

182
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,850
If such a convenient current existed,

183
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,490
you'd expect to see more survivors
from the sky island in the Blue Sea.

184
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,680
Don't be silly.

185
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,290
Since it's difficult for people
to come up here in the first place,

186
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,500
it's just natural that not many
people escape here safely as well.

187
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,810
It's possible that quite a lot of the
people who tried couldn't escape

188
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,330
because they were too slow.

189
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,390
Not knowing when to back off
can cost you your life.

191
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,560
Hurry up and get ready to set sail.
Weigh anchor quickly.

192
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,640
Chopper, use your Heavy Bonus
now and start on the heavy lifting.

193
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
Err... I told you, it's Heavy Point.

194
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,200
What?!

195
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,180
N-Nothing.

196
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,320
Now, wake up Zoro.

197
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,220
That's impossible.

198
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,090
Don't worry. I can do it alone!

199
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,630
We'd better hurry up,
or Conis' kindness will be wasted.

200
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,830
Heavy Point!

201
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,090
I put this one here...

202
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,160
Hm? No, this is in the wrong place.

203
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,460
I put the red one there,

204
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,420
and put the emerald green broad beans here.

205
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,380
Now, they look more delicious than before.

206
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,220
This one is for Nami-san and Robin-chan.

207
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,180
Wow, they don't look like food!

208
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,320
--No, thank you. I'm sorry.
--I've never seen such a pretty lunch before.

209
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,070
Really?

210
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,480
This is for you, Conis-chan.

211
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,190
Oh?! You made one for me, too?!

212
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,730
Of course! The title of this lunch is...

213
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,200
"Love is a dilemma.
Lunch for the falling angel."

214
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,950
Oh...

215
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,130
Well, once they're in your stomach,

216
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,570
they're all the same.

217
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,180
Don't say stuff that tears down my hard work!

218
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,770
Listen up. With food, presentation comes first!

219
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,730
Really?

220
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,490
See? Now they're the same.

221
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,180
You're just chowing down
without looking at them!

222
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,530
Really?

223
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,680
Umph!

224
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,440
They're the same after all.
They taste the same.

225
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,650
Like I said, enjoy them with your eyes first!

226
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,700
--Don't be rude! Not even
I can eat with my eyes!
--Hmm?

227
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,390
That's not what I mean!

228
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,700
--But I've eaten with my nose before...
--Don't do that!

229
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,930
...though I didn't mean to.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,450
Now we'll just wait until Luffy
and the others come back.

231
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,690
Okay!

232
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,950
Okay!

233
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,540
Chopper!

234
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,970
What just happened?!

235
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,280
What's going on?!

236
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,740
I wonder if we're already on that current.

237
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,830
Hey!

238
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,830
Something's wrong with the ship!

239
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,830
What?!

240
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,150
What's going on, Usopp?!

241
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,550
Look at that! The ship's rocking!

242
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,750
A party?

243
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
No fair, having a party without us!

244
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,050
Ah! Nami-san!

245
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,150
Why...

246
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,940
Why is she wearing a t-shirt?

247
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,640
Just where the heck is your mind at?!

248
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,430
Ahh! The ship started moving!

249
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,690
What?! Why?!

250
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,600
What're they doing? Where're they going?

251
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,690
Whoa!

252
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,140
It's moving backwards! That's incredible!

253
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,530
That's not it! They didn't set sail!

254
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,570
Huh?

255
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,820
Look underneath the ship!

256
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,120
Hold on! What is this? What's going on?!

257
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,500
Did we get on that current
thing earlier than we expected?

258
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,920
No, it doesn't look that way.

259
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,600
Wh-What the...?!

260
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,930
Ahh...!

261
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,270
That's...

262
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,100
...the famous White-White Sea
Super-Express Lobster!

263
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,560
What?!

264
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,410
It's trying to take us somewhere!

265
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,410
Hey! Everyone off the ship! There's still time!

266
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,960
What about the ship?! If our ship is taken...

267
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,750
Don't worry. I'll stay.

268
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,590
C'mon! What can you do by yourself?!

269
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,090
I'll pull it off somehow!

270
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
So, it doesn't work...?

271
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,740
There we go.

272
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,570
Alright, this'll work!

273
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,670
Unfortunately, it seems that won't work.

274
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,650
Come on board!

275
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,670
What'd you say?!

276
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
Even if that works,

277
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,850
it looks like they'll just move
right on to their next move. Look.

278
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,050
What?!

279
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,980
Large skyfish are following us
with their mouths open.

280
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,770
We can't jump off the ship and escape now.

281
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,900
Even if we could defeat them,

282
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,890
another batch will probably arrive soon.

283
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,580
There's nothing we can do.

284
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,150
It's probably already started.

285
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,970
Heaven's Judgment, huh?

286
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,150
So, instead of sending people
after us, they're bringing us in.

287
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,200
What an impudent guy...

288
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,450
Then... I'm going back to that island?

289
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,920
Luffy!! Usopp!! Sanji-kun!!

290
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,790
Why...? Why a t-shirt...?

291
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,370
You're still talking about that?!

292
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,360
Hey, Luffy! This is terrible!

293
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,140
What will we do?! What will we do?!

294
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,260
Where'd they go?

295
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,810
Where?! Of course...! Err...

296
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,390
So where?

297
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,470
--Where...
--...did they...
--...go?

298
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,320
The Super-Express Lobster
is a messenger for God.

299
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,730
What it transports is always an offering to God.

300
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,650
So, it's headed to northeast Upper Yard...

301
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,900
...to the sacrificial altar.

302
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,730
Sacrifice?!

303
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,160
Nami-san, Robin-chan, and the rest...

304
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,830
--The rest?!
--...will be sacrificed?!

305
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,840
For that darn God?!

306
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,720
That son of a bitch!

307
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,290
Don't mess with us!! You bastard!!

308
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,660
Hold on a second, please! But, I'm sorry.

309
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,970
That's not the case!

310
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,540
What?!

311
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,990
I've heard that although it's called sacrifice,

312
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,380
in Heaven's Judgment,

313
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,060
there're two kinds of
punishment that criminals receive.

314
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,650
Sacrifice and an ordeal.

315
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,740
They're currently hostages,
so to speak, in God's hands.

316
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,400
Hostages?!

317
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,040
So, the ones who are
actually being judged are...

318
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,870
...the three of you.

319
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,390
Huh? What do you mean?

320
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,880
If we had some sort of map...

321
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,590
Oh... I have a map of Skypiea with me.

322
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,180
This one is very old, too.

323
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,780
But the shape of the island seems correct.

324
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,120
Are you all right, Conis-chan?

325
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,060
Yes.

326
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,180
But...

327
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,650
Don't worry.

328
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,540
It's them we're talking about. They're fine.

329
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,820
How can you be so sure?

330
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,600
This is where you are right now.

331
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,140
The sacrificial altar is in the
left upper direction, northeast.

332
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,490
There's only one way to get there.

333
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,510
You take the Milky Road that leaves this island

334
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,860
by using a dial boat,

335
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,980
and go across to the forest
where the priests await you.

336
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,440
Well, old guy, instead of taking the trouble
of going through the middle of the island,

337
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,030
all we have to do is go around
the island by boat, right?

338
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,030
That lobster went to Upper Yard
that way, too, right?

339
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,820
Well... even if you can go ashore nearby,

340
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,970
you can't get to the altar on foot.

341
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,380
The big difference between this
map and the current Upper Yard

342
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,300
is the Milky Roads that are
stretched all around the island.

343
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,290
The cloud canals that you mentioned, huh?

344
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,230
Yes. I hear that there're
several hundred Milky Roads,

345
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,380
large and small in size, over there.

346
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,020
Hmm... I see...

347
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,810
That's why entering the island by boat

348
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,980
and taking the Milky Roads
within the island is the only way.

349
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,830
I see...

350
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,840
So no matter where we go ashore,
the canals will block our way.

351
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,140
That's right.

352
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,160
By the way, there're
man-eating fish in the canals.

353
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,990
Man-eating fish?!

354
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,320
They've really covered all their bases.

355
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,900
So, they're saying that if we
want our friends and ship back,

356
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,100
we just have to come in from the front.

357
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,720
So that's our ordeal and...

358
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,590
Heaven's Judgment?!

359
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,930
Yes.

360
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,370
In Upper Yard, four priests who are
strong beyond imagination await you.

361
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,200
Oh, then it's easy.

362
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,340
To put it simply, all we have to do
is beat up those priests, right?

363
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,240
You're so simpleminded.

364
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,370
This is becoming fun!

365
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:22,400
Even if we're far apart

366
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,870
I don't want you to forget

367
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:38,390
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

368
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,090
You have a friend here to share the pain

369
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,640
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

370
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,230
I won't let it just be a dream

371
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:05,910
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

372
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:13,110
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

373
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,210
Conis, why are you shaking like that?

374
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,830
Oh? You think so?

375
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,570
Now that I look closer, you look pale, too.

376
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,610
I...

377
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,110
You look like you're afraid of something.

378
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,250
Would you please run?

379
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,980
What?

380
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,350
Once we know someone's a criminal,

381
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,070
if we don't lead them to the place of judgment,

382
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,260
we'll be killed, so...

383
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,890
On the next episode of One Piece!

384
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,110
"A Trap On Lovely Street! The Almighty Eneru."

385
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,130
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
