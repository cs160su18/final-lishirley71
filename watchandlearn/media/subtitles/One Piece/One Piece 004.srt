2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,810
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,760
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,660
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,620
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,630
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,820
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,540
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,840
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,400
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,200
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,280
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,500
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,710
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,210
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,370
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,600
Another big haul today!

25
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,400
Buggy-sama won't be mad at us,
now that we got all this!

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,120
Huh?

27
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,330
Hey, check it out...

28
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,120
What's with that boat?

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,090
I-It's a girl!

30
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,810
Hey! What's wrong with you?

31
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,680
Oh! Am I dreaming?

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,520
Running into someone
on this wide open sea...

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,490
I-I don't know who you are, but... water...

34
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,700
Might I ask for a cup of water?

35
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,200
I can give you all the money you'd like.

36
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,350
Please, help me!

37
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,160
No problem!
We'll help you!

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,670
But not until we see what treasure ya got!

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,970
Don't mind us!

40
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,010
I can't get it open...
Does it go like this?

41
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,360
You can keep my entire boat, if you'd like!

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
Our boat!

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,900
You tricked us!

44
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,570
A cold front accompanied by low
clouds spotted in the southern sky!

45
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,970
Intense winds and
squalls expected very soon!

46
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,660
All small boats take
caution not to capsize!

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,920
Bingo!

48
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,480
See ya! I'll just take
your treasure now!

49
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,030
Wait! You bitch--!

50
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,360
We'll get you for this--!

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,580
"Luffy's Past!
Enter Red-Haired Shanks"

52
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm starving...

53
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,890
When the hell're
we gonna reach land?

54
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,260
Who knows. We're just going
with the wind and waves, after all...

55
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,840
I wonder if we'll reach land...

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,460
Nah, I'm sure we will, sometime.

57
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,820
Isn't it kind of weird that someone
tryin' to be King of the Pirates...

58
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,710
doesn't even have
any navigational skills?!

59
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,920
It's not weird.
I just drifted around.

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,070
But aren't you a bounty hunter
who wandered the high seas?

61
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,600
I have no memory of ever even
calling myself a bounty hunter.

62
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,940
I set onto the sea in
search of a certain man...

63
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
but then couldn't
get back to my village.

64
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,440
I had no choice, so I just went
after pirate ships to earn a living.

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,320
Oh. So you're just lost.

66
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,530
Don't put it like that!

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,820
Shanks!

68
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,920
This straw hat is dear to me--

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,590
it's been with me through many a fight.

70
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,930
Luffy. I can't give this even to you.

71
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,760
Then take me on your
next voyage, Shanks!

72
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,720
I wanna be a pirate too!

73
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,600
As if you could ever be a pirate!

74
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,450
Why not?!

75
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,950
Luffy.

76
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,960
Just bein' a good swimmer doesn't
mean you'd make a good pirate.

77
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,740
I'm good at fighting too!
My punches are like pistols!

78
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, really?

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
What's that mean?!

80
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,520
He means you're too
much of a kid, Luffy!

81
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,820
Seriously, you're as old as my own kid!

82
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm not a kid! I'm a grownup!

83
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,950
Now, now. Don't get so mad.

84
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,680
Here! Have some juice!

85
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
Wow! Thanks!

86
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,600
--See, you are a kid! Ha!
--That wasn't fair, Shanks!

87
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,010
Don't laugh!

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,760
Stupid cheapskate Shanks!

89
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,520
Pardon us.

90
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,210
Oh... So these are "pirates."

91
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,450
Look pretty damn dumb.

92
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,500
Welcome...

93
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,040
We're mountain bandits.

94
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,630
But we ain't here
to tear up the place.

95
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,740
Sell us some booze.
Ten barrels oughta do.

96
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,430
I'm sorry.
I just ran out of alcohol.

97
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,430
That's odd.

98
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,930
These pirates seem to be drinking
something... What is it, water?

99
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,480
No, what they're
drinking is the last of it.

100
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,280
My apologies. Looks like we
drank the whole place dry.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,650
Sorry!

102
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,830
You can have this, if you'd like.
It hasn't been opened yet.

103
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,160
There's an eight million Berry
bounty on my head, you know.

104
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,090
One bottle ain't even enough for
a bedtime drink! Don't insult me!

105
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,340
Now the floor's all wet.

106
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,760
Sorry about that, Makino-san.
Do you have a rag?

107
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,230
Oh, I'll do that!

108
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,530
Seems you like to clean.

109
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,070
Then maybe you'll find this more fulfilling.

110
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,030
Not worth our time if
they're out of booze. Let's go!

111
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,500
Later, wimps!

112
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,780
Are you all right, Captain?
Are you hurt?!

113
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,140
Oh, I'm fine.
No problem at all.

114
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,350
--He got you good, boss!
--Talk about lame!

115
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,940
Why are you laughing?!

116
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,380
That was so uncool!

117
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,240
Why didn't you fight them?!

118
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,080
No matter how many there
are or how strong they seem,

119
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,870
you're not men-- or pirates-- if you
laugh after something like that!

120
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,210
I can understand how you feel,

121
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,930
but he only spilled some booze on me.

122
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,880
It's nothing worth getting mad over.

123
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,000
Whatever!

124
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,310
--Eating out of frustration, Luffy?
--Shut up!

125
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,370
Wait, what're you eating?!

126
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,890
That box! Did you eat
what was in that box?!

127
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,820
Y-Yeah...

128
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,680
Spit it out! Right now!
Every last bite!

129
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,990
W-What're you doing, Shanks?!

130
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,630
What... was that?

131
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,610
What you ate was
the Gum-Gum Fruit!

132
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,340
The Gum-Gum Fruit
is known as a Devil Fruit!

133
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,340
Eating it turns your body to rubber,

134
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,260
and makes you lose the ability
to swim for the rest of your life!

135
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,860
Eh?! No way!

136
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,630
You dumbass!

137
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,710
People were drinkin'
and havin' a nice time.

138
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,040
What's the idea, boy?

139
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,760
Dammit! Apologize!

140
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,500
How dare you make fun
of Shanks and his crew!

141
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,000
Did I say something to offend you?

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
You did! Now apologize!

143
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,260
Mayor!

144
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,200
You see the looks
on those pirates' faces?!

145
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,160
He got covered in booze
but didn't say a word!

146
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,900
Talk about pathetic!

147
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,640
Pirates are just a bunch of wimps.

148
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,190
They're nothing but talk.

149
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,440
Stop it!

150
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,110
Stop making fun of
Shanks and the others!

151
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,660
They are not wimps!

152
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,120
Stop, Luffy!

153
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,910
Stop making fun of Shanks and
the others! You stupid bandits!

154
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,690
You oughta watch your mouth, boy.

155
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,050
No one who's ever made me
mad has lived to tell the tale.

156
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,140
Wait!

157
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,600
Let the boy go! Please!

158
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,210
I don't know what Luffy has done,

159
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,100
nor do I intend to fight with you!

160
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,140
If you're not offended,
I'll even pay you!

161
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,280
Just, please!
Spare the boy's life!

162
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,740
Mayor!

163
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,950
Leave it to senior citizens
to know how the world works.

164
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,670
But no, it's too late for him now.

165
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,610
After all, he's made me angry...

166
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,960
You're the bad guys!
You mountain apes!

167
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,940
You're a lost cause, kid.

168
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,880
You can regret all this in the next life!

169
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,180
--Luffy!
--Please! Let him go!

170
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,590
I was wondering why
the bar was empty...

171
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,430
...looks like it's those
mountain bandits from before.

172
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,640
Captain!

173
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,580
Shanks!

174
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,530
So you pirates are still here, huh?

175
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,010
Have you been scrubbing the
village clean this whole time?

176
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,970
Luffy!

177
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,180
I thought your punches
were as strong as pistols?

178
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,350
S-Shut up!

179
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,060
I dunno why you're here, but
you'd best leave before you get hurt.

180
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,160
Any closer and he'll
shoot your head off, wimp.

181
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,480
He said no closer!

182
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,780
Don't make me blow your head off!

183
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,540
Put your life on the line.

184
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,580
Huh?!

185
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,290
Now that you've drawn your pistol,
put your life on the line.

186
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,540
What the hell're you talkin' about?

187
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm saying those aren't
for threatening people.

188
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,310
--N-Now you've done it!
--These bastards fight dirty!

189
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,390
--Dirty?
--Cut the crap.

190
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,030
What, do you think you're
dealing with saints or something?

191
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,740
You're looking at pirates!

192
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,910
Shut up! You got nothin' to
do with this in the first place!

193
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,830
Listen, bandits.

194
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,300
Whether I'm splattered with
alcohol or food or even spit on,

195
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,860
most of the time I'd just
laugh and forget about it.

196
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,880
But!

197
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,950
No matter what the reason,

198
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,260
anyone who hurts
my friends has to pay!

199
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,520
Shanks...

200
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,300
Has to pay, huh?!

201
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,470
Lousy pirates! Kill 'em, men!

202
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,900
I'll handle this.
Should be easy enough.

203
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,510
Don't get cocky, bandit.

204
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,000
If you wanna fight us, then go
drag a warship here or somethin'.

205
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,110
So strong!

206
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,880
H-Hold on!
The kid attacked us!

207
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,850
You are a wanted man.

208
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,510
Damn it!

209
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,090
A smokescreen!

210
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,550
Luffy!

211
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,380
Crap! I let my guard down!
Luffy's gone!

212
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,250
What do we do, guys?!

213
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,190
Quit freakin' the hell out, boss!

214
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,870
It won't take us long to find him!

215
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,200
I can't believe this guy...

216
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,380
I made a clean getaway!

217
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,360
They'll never expect a mountain
bandit to escape onto the sea!

218
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,980
Dammit! Let me go, you stupid ape!

219
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,580
I hope you die!

220
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,790
You wish!
You're the one who's gonna die!

221
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,750
After all, you've made me mad!

222
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,940
So long!

223
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,620
Dammit! Dammit!

224
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,960
Those guys are scum,

225
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,470
but I couldn't even
hit them once! Dammit!

226
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,480
Sorry! I got no use for you anymore!

227
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,700
W-What the hell?!

228
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,560
Help!

229
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,620
Shanks!

230
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,980
Get lost!

231
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,580
I'm in your debt, Luffy...

232
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,090
Makino-san told me everything.

233
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,890
You fought for us.

234
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,540
Hey, don't cry! You're a man!

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,120
But... Shanks!

236
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,840
Your arm!

237
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,980
It's only an arm. It's no big deal.

238
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm just glad you're alright...

239
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,720
You're leaving, then?

240
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,080
Yeah. It was a long stay,
but now we part ways.

241
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,220
Bet you'll miss me, huh?

242
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,320
Well, yeah, but I won't
ask you to take me anymore.

243
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,400
I've decided to become
a pirate on my own now!

244
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,240
I wasn't gonna take you anyway!

245
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,220
You'll never be a pirate!

246
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,700
I will too!

247
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,660
Someday, I'm gonna gather
a crew every good as yours,

248
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,120
and I'm gonna find the
greatest treasure in the world,

249
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,900
and I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates! I'll show you!

250
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,550
You're gonna surpass us, huh?

251
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,420
In that case...

252
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,170
...I'll leave this hat with you.

253
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,010
It's dear to me.

254
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
Take good care of it!

255
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,280
Come bring it back to me someday!

256
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,060
Once you've become a great pirate!

257
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,660
That's our promise, Luffy!

258
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,390
Hey.

259
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,860
You're gonna drop it
again if you space out.

260
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,350
Isn't it important?

261
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,460
Yeah.

262
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
Thank you, Zoro!

263
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,350
Man, I'm hungry...

264
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,270
A bird...

265
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,750
Let's eat it!

266
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,680
Huh? How?

267
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,100
Leave it to me!

268
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,960
Gum-Gum...

269
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,420
...Rocket!

270
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,020
I see...

271
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,190
Help!

272
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,690
Moron!
What the hell're you doing?!

273
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,200
Hey! Stop! You there! Stop!

274
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,660
Shipwrecked people,
at a time like this?!

275
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,970
I can't stop!
Jump in on your own!

276
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,700
What?!

277
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm impressed you got on!

278
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,500
Are you trying to run us over?!

279
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,000
Hey! Stop the boat!

280
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,030
We're members of Buggy
the Clown-sama's crew!

281
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,340
This boat is ours now!

282
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,900
Huh?!

283
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,770
We had no idea you were the
famous Pirate Hunter Zoro-san!

284
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,770
--Forgive our rudeness!
--Forgive our rudeness!

285
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,390
Thanks to you guys,
I lost sight of my friend.

286
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,900
Just keep padding straight ahead!

287
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,100
--Yessir!
--Yessir!

288
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,300
Knowing Luffy, he'll manage
something once he spots land.

289
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
But what now, Bro?

290
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,950
Good question...

291
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,940
If Captain Buggy finds out a
girl stole our boat and treasure...

292
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,240
Y-Yeah...

293
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,840
Who's this Buggy guy?

294
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,240
You've never heard
of Buggy the Clown?!

295
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,760
Nope.

296
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,920
He's the head of our pirate ship!

297
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,530
He's eaten one of the Devil Fruits,

298
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,090
and is just an
all-around terrifying person...

299
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,540
Yes! I finally got it!

300
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,400
--Get back here, you!
--You wench! Give the map back!

301
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,300
We just stole that
chart of the Grand Line!

302
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,840
Dammit! If we don't get it back,
we're dead meat, too!

303
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,260
I don't wanna be killed by one
of the captain's cannonballs!

304
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,600
Captain Buggy!
I see something in the sky above the port!

305
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,820
Shoot it down!

306
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,360
W-What the--?

307
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,210
W-What?!

308
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,650
What the--?!

309
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,670
A person fell from the sky!

310
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,880
Dammit! What are
cannonballs flying at me for?!

311
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,600
But now I'm safe!

312
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,940
That was a pretty
neat experience I had!

313
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:24,360
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

314
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,300
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

315
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

316
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:52,490
If the world is going to change

317
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:59,610
before I can even attain my dream

318
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:06,730
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

319
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:19,720
so that my memories won't fade

320
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,820
Whoa! Being alive while all
chopped up is no human technique!

321
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,000
What? As a rubber guy, you're
plenty of a monster yourself!

322
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,510
Nothing makes sense anymore!

323

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,070

On the next episode of One Piece!

326
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,170
"A Terrifying, Mysterious Power!
Captain Buggy, the Clown Pirate!"
