00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,750
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,700
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,790
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,560
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,410
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,760
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,450
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,450
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,260
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,070
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,990
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,880
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,380
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,010
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,230
What's with this restaurant?

25
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,230
It's as if... as if...
this were a pirate ship!

26
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,150
We've got trouble!
Pirate Krieg's underling...

27
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,530
This is a restaurant, right?

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,120
Sir, do you have money for that?

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,170
--Would a bullet do?
--So you don't have money, right?

30
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,380
Eat it.

31
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,760
I found a good cook!

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,630
This is a good opportunity.

33
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,180
Damn geezer!

34
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,310
Leave this place with them!

35
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,690
You're no longer needed
at this restaurant!

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,720
"The Strongest Pirate Fleet!
Commodore Don Krieg"

37
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,400
Hey, you damn geezer!
I'm the Sous Chef here.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,740
What do you mean you
no longer need me?!

39
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,140
You often get into
trouble with customers.

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,200
You flare your nostrils
the second you see a girl.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,560
You can't even cook a decent meal,

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
so you're dead weight
to this restaurant.

43
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,870
That's what I said.

44
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,510
Say that again...

45
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,110
Also, the other cooks
steer clear of you...

46
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,770
So go be a pirate or whatever,

47
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,110
and just leave this restaurant already!

48
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,670
Say what?

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,910
If I keep quiet, you just shoot your
mouth off, huh? You damn geezer!

50
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,060
The rest I could overlook,

51
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,530
but I'm not just gonna
let you trash my cooking!

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,870
No matter what you say,
I'll stay here as a cook!

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,800
And that's final!

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,510
Just what's the meaning of you
grabbing the owner by the collar?

55
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,640
You idiot!

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,200
Damn you...

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,890
Quit screwing around...

58
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,680
No matter how hard
you try to kick me out,

59
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,690
I'll continue to work here as a cook...

60
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,790
...until you die!

61
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,570
I won't die! I'll live 100 more years!

62
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,650
That geezer is never short of words...

63
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,780
All right, you have permission!
Now you can become a pirate.

64
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,660
No way!

65
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,720
Now... Sorry about that.

66
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,930
I'd like to make up for it by serving
you fruit macedonia, my princess.

67
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,320
Wow, thank you! You're so kind.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,230
--Any time...
--And no apology to us?!

69
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm gonna sue you,
you stupid love cook!

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,180
I'm serving you tea, aren't I?
Thank me for that, long-nose.

71
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,310
Huh? You wanna fight?
I won't go easy on you.

72
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,030
Beat him up, Zoro!

73
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,540
Do it yourself.

74
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,200
Stop! Please don't fight because of me.

75
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
--Yes, I'll stop.
--Who said it was because of you?!

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,230
--By the way, you know...
--Yes?

77
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,280
The food you have here is delicious...

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,970
...but it seems a little
expensive for me...

79
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,530
Of course, it'll be free.

80
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,830
Thank you!

81
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,880
--Yours are not free.
--Wha...

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,080
You're too predictable.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,540
What are you sitting around for?!

84
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,970
When customers sit down,
bring them moist hand-towels!

85
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,040
Yes, sir.

86
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,300
Well... with this and that going on,

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,190
four days have passed...

88
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,930
When can we leave here?

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,070
Who knows?

90
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,070
Is he really going to work here
as a chore boy for a year?

91
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,030
What's the problem? The food
is free and it's comfortable here.

92
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,740
For you it is.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,250
Hey, Luffy!

94
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,910
Hmm?

95
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,200
What's going on?!
Let's leave here soon!

96
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,920
Wait a little longer.
I'll try talking to Owner again.

97
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,590
I'm begging you!

98
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,210
Hey, what's the matter?

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,930
An hourglass...
on each side of the skull...

100
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,520
...to show the threat to enemies...

101
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,560
That flag is... that flag is...

102
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,980
There's no mistake... it belongs
to the ruler of the East Blue...

103
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,940
Don Krieg!!

104
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,670
Why... why are the Krieg Pirates here?!

105
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,770
You see it, Patty?! They actually came!

106
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,980
You're gonna get rid of them, right?!

107
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,740
I-Isn't it a mistake?!

108
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,680
This is the Don of a pirate fleet with a
5,000-pirate force we're talking about!

109
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,940
Why would he come all the way here
to get revenge just for one of his men?!

110
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,020
It's no mistake! He's really here!

111
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,830
Hey, this is not good!
Shouldn't we just get out of here?!

112
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,980
What a huge galleon!

113
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,450
What a huge ship!

114
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,340
I wonder if Ghin came back
to repay you for your kindness.

115
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,200
I don't think so...

116
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,460
But it seems strange...

117
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,300
--H-Hey...
--Wh-What the...

118
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,850
Their ship sure is beat up...

119
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,690
It doesn't seem like they
were attacked by cannons...

120
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,400
But then, it's hard to think
that damage is manmade.

121
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,580
Did they come across
a tornado or something?

122
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,540
Here he comes...

123
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,760
S-Sorry... Can I have
some water and food?

124
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,730
We have money... tons of money...

125
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,870
I don't even remember
the last time I ate.

126
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:57,280
Please... give me some water and food...

127
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,220
Wh-What's that?!

128
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,210
He shows neither dignity nor force.

129
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,000
Is he really that Don Krieg,
Commodore of the grand pirate fleet?

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,360
So he's hungry...

131
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,130
C-Captain!

132
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,180
Don Krieg!

133
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,930
P-Please! Help our captain!

134
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,350
He's really about to starve!

135
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,900
He hasn't eaten anything for days!
He'll die if he doesn't eat!

136
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,460
This is good! It's a riot to see

137
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,780
the famous arch rogue
Don Krieg like this...

138
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,580
We have money this time.
We're customers!

139
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,340
Don't be ridiculous!
Hey, contact the Navy right away.

140
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,110
What?

141
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,750
He's at his weakest right now.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

142
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,300
There's no need to feed him anything.
Keep him under arrest.

143
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,980
He's right! We don't know what
he'll do once his energy's back.

144
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,630
He's done bad things.

145
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,060
He deserved to starve because
of everything he's done!

146
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,290
Once he's back to normal, I bet he'll
attack this restaurant straight away.

147
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,970
There's no need to give
him even a glass of water.

148
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,130
I won't do anything...

149
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,890
I won't do anything...

150
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,270
Once I eat, I promise I'll leave quietly.

151
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,050
So please... help... me...

152
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,880
Don Krieg, please stop!

153
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,190
Please stop begging!
It's not something you should do!

154
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,060
Please don't do
something so disgraceful!

155
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:52,810
I promise... Please...
I'll take leftovers or anything...

156
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,020
Anything...

157
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,610
Don...

158
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,630
Ha! Are you trying
to gain our sympathy?

159
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,500
Hey, out of my way, Patty.

160
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,750
Oh, boy...

161
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,740
S... Sanji-san!

162
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,270
Here, Ghin. Let him eat it.

163
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,980
Sanji-san...

164
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,980
Thank you!

165
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,700
Hey, Sanji! Take that food away now!

166
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,670
Do you realize what kind of man he is?!

167
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,130
He's the man who's called
the East Blue Ruler,

168
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,030
the foul player Krieg!

169
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,920
It started in a prison.
He pretended to be a marine soldier

170
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,130
and took over a Navy ship by
killing a senior officer on the ship.

171
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,680
That's how he declared himself a pirate.

172
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,080
He sometimes raised the Navy
flag and entered into harbors

173
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,230
in order to attack the
towns and passenger ships.

174
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,270
He also raised a white flag
and then attacked enemy ships...

175
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,050
He did anything to continue winning.
That's how he got to where he is now!

176
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,330
Huh... so he plays dirty.

177
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,600
His real strength is
overwhelming as well.

178
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,670
Leaving after eating?
That's not possible with him!

179
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,760
Letting such a wicked fiend die
without help is for society's sake!

180
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,050
What?!

181
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,770
S... Sanji!

182
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,440
Th... This isn't what
we agreed, Don Krieg!

183
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,760
I brought you here under the condition
that you wouldn't touch this restaurant!

184
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,290
And that man saved our lives...

185
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,760
Yeah, that was delicious.

186
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,090
I feel alive again.

187
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,590
H-Hey... Wh-What the hell
is going on in there?

188
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,890
We'll see when we go in there.

189
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,990
What?! A-Are you serious?!

190
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,700
Oh? Are you scared?

191
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,740
Wha... Don't be silly!

192
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,660
Hmph!

193
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,160
This is strange...

194
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,860
There's almost no sign
of anyone on that ship...

195
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,860
This is a good restaurant.
I'll take this ship.

196
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,960
So... that's what you want...

197
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,110
Ow, ow, ow...

198
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,920
My ship became a wreck,
so I wanted a new one.

199
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,340
You'll get off this ship after you
take care of what I tell you to do.

200
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,720
Wh-What?!

201
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,640
Don Krieg... This isn't
what you promised.

202
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,270
There're about 100 of my
underlings still alive on my ship.

203
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,480
They're weak with
hunger and severe injuries.

204
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,780
First, prepare 100 meals
and water for them.

205
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,760
There're some who've
already starved to death.

206
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,950
W-Water...

207
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,040
Bring them over immediately!

208
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,010
Are you telling us to revive pirates

209
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,770
that are gonna attack this ship?!

210
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,760
We refuse!

211
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,240
Refuse? Don't get the wrong idea.

212
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,630
I'm not placing an order.
I'm giving you orders.

213
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:32,650
It doesn't matter who
you are... don't defy me!!

214
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,660
--Sanji-san...
--Hmm?

215
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,500
Sanji-san, I'm sorry...
I didn't mean for this to happen...

216
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,460
You son of a bitch!
Look what you've done!!

217
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,360
Hey Sanji! Where're you going?!

218
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,160
To the kitchen.
I have to prepare 100 more meals.

219
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,620
--Sanji-san!
--Sanji?!

220
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,580
--What?!
--What?!

221
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,970
Right. That's how it should be.

222
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,230
Are you Krieg's spy, Sanji?!

223
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,010
We can't let you go in the kitchen!

224
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,470
We're fed up with your crazy behavior!

225
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,440
Go ahead...

226
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,860
If you want to stop me, go ahead!

227
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,780
I know...

228
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,240
He's an incorrigible rogue...
I know that much...

229
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,000
But that doesn't matter to me.
That doesn't matter!

230
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,110
What happens after we feed them...
It's too much of a bother to think about it.

231
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,670
I'm a cook. No more. No less.

232
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,070
If there's someone who's hungry,
I'll feed him. That's all.

233
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,010
It's all right for a cook to be
that way, don't you think?

234
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,920
Patty!

235
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,740
Hey, someone keep him restrained!

236
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,700
Sanji, you sometimes feed customers
I drive away at the back door, don't you?

237
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,670
I'm not gonna say who's right,
but this time, it's your mistake.

238
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm not going to let you do
what you want any longer.

239
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,880
I'll protect this restaurant.

240
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,940
Fortunately, we have
only one enemy to fight.

241
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,590
Even if it's Don Krieg,
what can he do against us?

242
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,310
This is a sea restaurant where
pirates come and go every day.

243
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,180
We're fully prepared to
serve any kind of customer!

244
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,230
That's...

245
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,760
Are you full now, Krieg-san?

246
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,110
After the main course, how about...

247
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,280
...a piece of iron dessert?!

248
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,870
Meat Ball of Doom!!

249
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,840
Don!

250
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,610
I might've broken the doors.
Owner's gonna yell at me again.

251
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,840
Well, you did it to
protect the restaurant.

252
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,250
It's a small price to pay.

253
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,540
What're you gonna do
about those in Krieg's ship?

254
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,810
Who knows?

255
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,740
Maybe we'll spread butter
on the ship and stir-fry it...

256
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:20,420
It'll taste good, right? You lame cook!

257
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,140
How dare you serve
such a nasty dessert?!

258
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,340
This is the lousiest restaurant!

259
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,890
You're damn annoying!!

260
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,030
From all over his body...

261
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,150
Bullets...

262
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,250
Don't defy me!

263
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm the strongest!

264
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,970
Steel arms more
powerful than anyone's...

265
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,230
A wootz steel-made body
that is harder than anyone's...

266
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,930
And a diamond fist that
can destroy anything!

267
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,650
I have all sorts of built-in
weapons throughout my body...

268
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,960
The 50-ship large fleet
and 5,000-pirate force!

269
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,400
I've won all battles in the past!

270
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,990
I am the man fit to be called Don!

271
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,740
Out of my way, kid!

272
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,040
When I tell you to prepare food,

273
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,540
all you have to do is
obediently follow orders!

274
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,050
Don't defy me!

275
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,730
There's probably enough
for 100 meals in this.

276
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,940
Bring it to your ship right away.

277
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,140
--Owner Zeff!
--Owner Zeff!

278
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,600
What's with that, pops?
I could've gotten hurt!

279
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,140
Z... Zeff?

280
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,250
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

281
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,970
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

282
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:38,310
before someone else could
beat me to it

283
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:52,490
If the world is going to change

284
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:06,630
before I can even attain my dream

285
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,680
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

286
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,020
so that my memories won't fade

287
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,510
Is it really okay to give
Krieg food like this?

288
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,440
Yeah. Do something about that, pops!

289
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,760
Okay, leave it to me!

290
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,450
Hey! What're you doing, Luffy?!

291
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,910
Don't go picking a fight
with Krieg, you idiot!

292
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,990
That sounds fun.
Gonna fight, Luffy? Need a hand?

293
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,090
On the next episode of One Piece!

294
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,580
"Protect Baratie!
The Great Pirate, Red Foot Zeff!"

295
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
