00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,050
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,710
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,220
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,610
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,440
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,670
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,300
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,340
Luffy and friends have agreed...

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,020
...to another Davy Back Fight
with the Foxy Pirates.

25
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,990
Despite putting up a good fight,
Luffy soon found himself all alone.

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,840
Straw Hat Luffy is out!

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,010
Wha...?!

28
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,460
Team Foxy emerges victorious in
Round #1's game of Hit and Dead Ball!

29
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:54,020
"Showdown on the Cliff!
Red Light, Green Light!"

30
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,450
Our Foxy Pirates have claimed victory
in Round #1 of this second fight!

31
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,660
It's time to claim our booty...

32
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,870
...and take one member of Team Straw Hat!

33
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,210
Who will our boss choose?!

34
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,450
--The one I want...
--...is obvious to us all! Right, Boss?

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,250
You!

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,500
The archaeologist, Nico Robin!

37
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,630
Me?

38
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,650
Oh, my! Our captain has chosen
Nico Robin, the archaeologist!

39
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,430
Oh, Captain! You naughty man!

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,680
Oh, no! Why didn't you choose Choppy, Boss?!

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,410
She's dangerous as an enemy.

42
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,570
Taking her first will give us
the advantage from here on out.

43
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:43,460
--Still...!
--We can get Doctor Chopper
for sure in the next round!

44
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,030
Now I get it! You're so smart, Boss!

45
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,950
--Robin!
--Robin-chan!

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,410
Bye.

47
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,650
I can feel the deep sorrow
hidden behind her smile!

48
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,720
The pain of having to part with me...!

49
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,340
Damn! How dare they take
Robin-chan against her will,

50
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,350
even if it is in the rules?!

51
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,300
Robin!

52
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,570
How do I look?

53
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,410
--Suits you perfectly!
--You look great, black-haired lady!

54
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,480
I wanted you to join us from the very start!

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,850
Ugh! She's so popular!

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,110
R-Robin's really gettin' along with 'em...

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,120
I never trusted her to begin with...

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,130
Don't be crazy! Robin is counting on us!

59
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,210
I think.

60
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,580
Good point as always, Nami-san.

61
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,170
I'm gonna win her right back in the next round.

62
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,170
Okay! Let's do the next round already!

63
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,530
You can't play in the next round, Luffy.
You're in the third round.

64
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,850
Learn the rules already, will ya?

65
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,850
Oh. I guess I'm on cheering duty then.

66
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,480
But there's only five of us for Round #2...

67
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,940
Pathetic Straw Hat team!
You've lost more than another member!

68
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,140
You've lost a major part of your offense!

69
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,450
How do you like them grapes, err, apples?!

70
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,490
Now let's start the next round!

71
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,790
Round #2 will be a game held on
Long Reef: Dash Touch Domination!

72
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,950
Or "D.T.D." for short!

73
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,490
It's a six-on-six group competition,

74
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,380
but without Nico Robin, Team Straw Hat
will only have five players!

75
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,930
The rules are simple!

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,720
Basically, it's like the
"Red Light, Green Light" game!

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,620
Move even a muscle after the
"stop light" stops calling and you're out!

78
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,570
Whichever team touches
the "stop light" first wins!

79
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,780
But this is no kid's game!

80
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,450
Keep in mind, this is a pirate
version of "Red Light, Green Light"!

81
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,030
All weapons are okay to use!

82
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,400
D.T.D. is a truly perilous game!

83
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,610
First is Team Straw Hat...
with the same ol' lineup.

84
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,750
Leave us alone!

85
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:03,000
Team Foxy is led by our idol
Porche-chan and Hamburg the oddball!

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,220
I'm going to win Choppy
with my own two hands!

87
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,680
Then there's the ever-swift Chiqicheetah,
the swordfish fishman Capote,

88
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,290
as well as "Tackle Machine" Pickles
and Big Pan the wotan,

89
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,930
who have both vowed revenge
for their Groggy Ring defeat!

90
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,560
Those losers will pay for humiliating us!

91
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,570
These are the six members
of the truly mighty Team Foxy!

92
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,580
What's the old stilts guy doing up there?

93
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,160
I forgot an important detail!

94
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,290
Tonjit the nomad here
will act as the "stop light"!

95
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,200
The great fool, err, man of bravery
who stood atop stilts for ten whole years,

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,010
reaching high into the heavens!

97
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,680
Tonjit is the only logical choice
to be our "stop light"!

98
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,780
I'm seriously sick of heights, though...

99
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,890
Hold on!

100
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,530
If he's the "stop light," doesn't that
give us a big advantage in D.T.D.?!

101
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,680
Don't abbreviate it too!

102
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,050
But Usopp's right! Luck's on our side!

103
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,360
You sure about this, Boss?!

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,120
It's nothin'! We pirates have to
battle the deep blue sea all the time!

105
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,070
Don't sweat the small stuff!

106
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,530
--Talk about generous!
--Wow! What a great guy!

107
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,660
Generous, my butt!

108
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,790
Right off the bat, we're given
a clearly unfair course!

109
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,050
I guess that Idiot-Idiot Beam is his only talent...

110
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,050
--Lame Fox!
--Split-Head...

111
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,310
Idiot-Idiot Beam...

112
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,760
Lame Fox...

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,120
--Split-Head...!
--Boss!

114
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,180
--Pull yourself together!
--You really take things to heart, Boss.

115
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,520
First, as the D.T.D. rules state,
both teams must start by calling out...

116
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,900
First step!

117
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,760
Oh! Team Foxy suddenly takes a big lead!

118
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,620
Bastards...!

119
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,790
This'll be a cinch if we
follow the plan! Let's do it!

120
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah!

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,750
I'm sure it goes without saying,

122
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,760
but there's more to this than rushing
ahead to touch the "stop light"!

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,300
This terrain makes it easy to lose
your balance during a sudden stop,

124
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,050
so we can also expect the
enemy to use that against us!

125
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,640
Split-Head! Get in the way
and I won't sit by quietly!

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,960
Split...

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,060
Ha! Like I need to interfere!
This is going to be a piece of cake!

128
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,900
Are you ready, Stop Light?!

129
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,780
--Mm-hmm.
--All right, then!

130
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,360
You can do it!

131
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,110
After Team Foxy's victory in the first round,

132
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,050
it's now time to begin Round #2's
Dash Touch Domination!

133
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,330
Ready! Go!

134
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,790
"Green..."

135
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,980
Dash, Hamburg!

136
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,690
Chiqicheetah is already ahead of the pack!

137
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,560
He's followed by "Full Dash" Hamburg!

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,180
Meanwhile, Roronoa and Sanji
are leading the Straw Hat pack!

139
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,190
--Move, dammit!
--No, you back off!

140
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,730
This is no time to argue while running!

141
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,320
Knock it off, Sanji-kun! Zoro!

142
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,470
Yeah, Sanji-kun! Zoro!

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,400
They're awesome!

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,110
"...light..."

145
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,990
Man, that's long! How can you hold
your breath so long, old stilts guy?!

146
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,610
He's an ideal "stop light"!

147
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,290
"Red..."

148
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,420
--You lovey-dovey loser!
--Say what, fish flake head?!

149
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,280
These are the two Straw Hats to look out for!

150
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,110
Let's knock 'em outta the game
right away, just as planned!

151
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,020
Go, Big Pan!

152
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,150
Punk Attack!

153
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,730
They're in trouble!

154
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,570
He's about to call "red light"!

155
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,570
This isn't the time for that!

156
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,910
"...l..."

157
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,500
"...ight...!"

158
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,790
Stop!

159
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,270
I-If we move now, we'll be out...!

160
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,530
Out!

161
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,240
Wow! Pickles and Big Pan of Team
Foxy are already out of the game!

162
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,250
All right, Zoro! Sanji!

163
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,320
No big deal! All we need is
one person to touch him to win!

164
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,830
Chiqicheetah, Porche, and Hamburg
have a huge lead over the Straw Hats!

165
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,350
Ooh! We're in a "totally going to win" mood!

166
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,810
They're too fast!

167
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,350
Zoro and Sanji are our only hope, but...

168
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,190
Damn Moss Head!

169
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,900
Stupid Love Cook!

170
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,310
Just so you know, I have the important task

171
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,880
of getting Robin-chan back.
I've had enough of you!

172
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,490
--"Gree..."
--I don't give a damn about you!

173
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,030
--"...eee..."
--Hold on, you protected species head!

174
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,430
Despite losing two players,

175
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,900
Team Foxy is closest to
reaching the "stop light"!

176
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,750
At this rate, Team Straw Hat
has no chance at all!

177
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,810
Go! Go!

178
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,220
Yes, that's it! Just like that!

179
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,530
"...een..."

180
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,240
Crap! It's your fault we're so
far behind, you damn Moss Head!

181
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,460
How did this happen?!

182
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,120
The path is gone!

183
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,630
I know you have no sense of direction,
but this takes the cake!

184
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,130
How can you even get lost in
a place with such a clear view?!

185
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,550
It might be easier to catch up
here than on a curved track...

186
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,370
Guess it's do or die!

187
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,730
Oh! Sanji is taking a chance now!

188
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,690
Yikes...!

189
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,200
Sanji's big gamble pays off!
He's now right behind the lead group!

190
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,580
Oh, that's no fair! Hurry, Hamburg!

191
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,320
Wh-What do you want...?

192
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,960
Never hurts to reduce the number of opponents!

193
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,670
Time for all three of you to kick the bucket!

194
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,930
Crap!

195
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,140
N-Nami! Usopp!

196
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,600
We've got no choice...

197
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,810
--Everyone run for it!
--Roger!

198
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,020
Hmph! There's no getting away from me!

199
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,940
Get back here!

200
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,900
Man, old stilts guy's "Green"
is really long this time...

201
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,030
Oh?!

202
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,240
H-He's asleep...!

203
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,830
--Get up!
--Hey, you! Wake up!

204
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,950
--Don't be sleepin'!
--"...light, red light!"

205
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,550
C-Crap!

206
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,170
Out!

207
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,720
Even though the "stop light" was napping,
Capote was caught off guard!

208
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,100
He's out of the game!

209
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,230
What kind of nerves does this guy have,
napping in a place like that?!

210
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,760
That's old stilts guy for you!

211
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,070
All right!

212
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,280
They're in firing range now!

213
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,850
It was gonna be such an easy win, too!
Now I'm a little worried...

214
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,780
The four players in the lead are now
within 100 meters of the "stop light"!

215
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,420
Will it be a mad dash to the end?!

216
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,800
It'll be one of these four
who touches the "stop light"!

217
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,380
Come on, Sanji!

218
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,470
No one's paying any attention to us...

219
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,110
Yeah, they're completely ignoring us...

220
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,870
I do feel a little useless.

221
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,340
At least there's comfort in knowing
we're not the only useless ones...

222
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,240
T-The path ends again...

223
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,870
Brr! I hope this'll end soon so
I can go eat something warm...

224
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,790
Outta the way!

225
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,710
Get him, Hamburg!

226
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,730
This time... I will make mincemeat out of ya!

227
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,800
You wanna fight, you damn gorilla?!

228
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,550
I'll get you this time!

229
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,510
Hamburg intercepts Sanji!

230
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,180
Meanwhile, Chiqicheetah heads for
the "stop light" at breakneck speed!

231
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,730
Sanji has fallen right into Porche-chan's trap!

232
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,440
What?!

233
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,990
Victory is ours!

234
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,910
Dammit!

235
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,010
Chiqicheetah rushes straight
for the "stop light" from behind!

236
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,330
"Ggg..."

237
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,330
Grachoo!

238
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,510
Out!

239
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,370
Oh, my! It was just a sneeze!

240
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,390
Tonjit hasn't started calling out
"red light, green light" yet!

241
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,860
Has his speed backfired on him?!
Chiqicheetah is out for jumping the gun!

242
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,960
Blast! Don't sneeze, Stop Light!

243
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,490
We were so close to winning, too!

244
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,690
Even your snot is long, old stilts guy!

245
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,210
Sure lucked out there...

246
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,040
He was sneezing...

247
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,820
This is no time to be laughing, Hamburg!

248
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,720
We have to win and take Choppy!

249
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,730
Both teams are closing in on the "stop light"!

250
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,750
At this distance, the next play
should decide the game!

251
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,100
Will the "stop light" be touched by
the duo of Porche-chan and Hamburg?!

252
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,070
Or will it be Sanji?! Which will it be?!

253
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,570
This is the moment of truth!

254
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,530
"Green..."

255
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,240
It appears he's indeed
calling out his line this time!

256
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,960
Take this! And this!

257
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,660
See you later!

258
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,130
H-Hamburg! What are you doing?!

259
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:18,540
--"...light..."
--Here comes Robin-chan's savior!

260
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
Oh! Sanji!

261
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,980
--What?!
--What's Porche-chan doing?!

262
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,770
--Stay still, Porche-chan!
--Do something!

263
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,070
"...rrr..."

264
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,650
Now Robin-chan's ours again.

265
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,570
She's totally gonna fall in love with me!

266
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,950
Sanji! Hurry up! Touch him!

267
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,490
--"...eeee..."
--Good work, old man.

268
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,420
The game's over now.

269
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,040
"...dddd..."

270
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,330
Oh, my! Sanji is turning back
before touching the "stop light"!

271
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,470
What is he doing?!

272
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,390
Even if you are my enemy,
I can't turn my back on a lady!

273
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,990
Incredible! Sanji, the nefarious cook,
has saved Porche-chan!

274
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,850
"...light!"

275
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,400
Hamburg is fighting to remain still!

276
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,160
But Sanji is as good as out,
despite having saved Porche-chan!

277
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,940
No, wait! There's Sanji!
And he has Porche-chan!

278
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,770
Not only that, Sanji is completely still,
despite his current situation!

279
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,880
He's not moving in the slightest! He's safe!

280
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,550
Impossible...!

281
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,590
How can he stand completely still
in the middle of the ocean?!

282
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,850
Oh! He's treading water!

283
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,140
All while carrying Porche-chan and
keeping his upper body motionless!

284
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,190
Just like a swan!

285
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,730
He's kicking furiously beneath the
surface while looking elegant above!

286
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,140
As long as the "stop light"
can't see him moving, he's safe!

287
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,570
Sanji is incredibly determined to win!

288
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,990
I will save Robin-chan, no matter what!

289
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,960
Sanji still has a chance to touch the "stop light"!

290
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,630
--He's one heck of an opponent!
--Impressive, Cook!

291
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,210
Sanji! You're too much...!

292
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,990
Oh, my! I could really fall for you, Mr. Cook!

293
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,010
Oh! Both Porche-chan and Sanji
have dived underwater!

294
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,970
You're both out!

295
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,310
H-Hey! Keep swimming!
You're gonna make me drown!

296
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,280
Oh, what have I done...! Robin-chan...!

297
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,240
"Green..."

298
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,490
Here we go again!

299
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,200
The only ones left now are
Hamburg of Team Foxy, and...!

300
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,010
--We're almost to the "stop light"!
--There's no one to stop us!

301
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,710
I can't believe we're gonna touch him!

302
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,130
"...light..."

303
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,430
Let's all touch him together!

304
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,550
Yeah!

305
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,540
Oh! The trio of forgotten Straw Hat
slowpokes is poised to touch him!

306
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,270
An upset's in the making!
Who would've thunk it?!

307
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,900
Just when I finally get on the real path...

308
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,860
Ugh! Kicking is that crappy
cook's specialty, but...

309
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,820
Get outta the way!

310
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,940
"...red..."

311
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,280
Yes!

312
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,500
Victory is certain for Team Straw Hat!

313
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,920
All right! We win!

314
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,300
"...light!"

315
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,470
Hamburg has touched the "stop light"!

316
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,650
Team Foxy is the winner of Round #2's
Dash Touch Domination game!

317
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,380
That's two supreme victories in a row!

318
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,520
Huh? It's over already?

319
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,620
You ended it!

320
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,630
In the worst possible way!

321
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,420
It's all your fault, Zoro!

322
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,590
I'm up next, right?

323
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,380
I'm gonna take back my crew! I'm their captain!

324
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,850
Haven't you forgotten an
important fact, Straw Hat?

325
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,000
You've lost twice now, which has cost
you Nico Robin and one other member!

326
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,290
But you can only win back
one crew member per game!

327
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:46,030
In short, if by some incredibly
rare chance you win the next round...

328
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,950
Get to the point, Split-Head.

329
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,570
Split...

330
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,190
In other words, there's only one round left,

331
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,160
so even if you win it, you can
only take one person back.

332
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,620
Huh?

333
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,750
Struggle as you might, Straw Hat,
you can't change the fact

334
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,090
that you've already lost one
of your crewmates for good!

335
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

336
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,710
Chasing after something constant

337
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,340
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

338
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,590
Even when we're exhausted

339
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,760
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

340
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,180
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

341
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,100
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

342
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,900
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

343
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,860
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

344
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,940
Eternally... Eternally...

345
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
Wild fantasies from our childhood

346
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,570
We trace unforgettable memories

347
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,250
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

348
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,040
To this familiar sunny sky

349
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Together we entrust our feelings

350
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,460
We go beyond the changing time

351
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,260
Eternally... Eternally...

352
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,490
Hey! Split-Head! Quit your blabbing
and start the next match already!

353
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,270
--Do you even understand the situation?!
--Luffy!

354
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,060
He's surprisingly cold-hearted.

355
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,220
His brotherly soul is burning
red-hot for you guys! Ain't it so?!

356
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,930
Oh, yeah!

357
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,180
On the next episode of One Piece!

358
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,280
"The Captains Square Off!
The Final Combat Round!"

359
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,520
King of the Pirates! Oh, yeah!
