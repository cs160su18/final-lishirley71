2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,980
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,740
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,230
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,360
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,420
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,100
Let's get this underway!

48
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,690
Be still, Straw Hat Luffy's shadow!

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,660
I am your new master.

50
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,690
I'm about to provide you with a voice and body

51
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,870
so that you may live as a zombie.

52
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,720
Forget all of your past relations
and become my obedient soldier!

53
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,900
It's time! Awaken!

54
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,260
Arise from 500 years of slumber!

55
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,020
Magnificent!

56
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,980
How truly overawing!
He's a piece of art! A real devil!

57
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,950
Meat!

58
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,410
I'm hungry!

59
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,500
Wh-What?! Ow!

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,210
Hey, let go of me!

61
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,040
This freak... is really strong!

62
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,540
Care to say your last farewells?

63
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,800
This woman is going to marry me today!

64
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,010
Huh? I'm disappearing too?

65
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,470
Why?!

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,100
Nami vanished with him!

67
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,110
Nami!

68
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,900
"A Belief Worth Begging to Live For!!
Brook Defends His Afro!"

69
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:57,200
♪ Yo ho ho ho, yo ho ho ho ♪

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,970
♪ Yo ho ho ho, yo ho ho ho ♪

71
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,560
♪ Yo ho ho ho... ♪

72
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,440
You refuse to quit even
after I flung you outside?

73
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,580
Of course! I will continue to
come back until you return to me!

74
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Do you not know my name?

75
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,330
All cower at the mere mention
of the swordsman Ryuma!

76
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,630
Silence! You are my shadow!

77
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,090
Our bodies are worlds apart!

78
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,960
You will come back to me!
You belong under my feet!

79
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,290
What a disaster!

80
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,850
The Humming Swordsman isn't the
only one here who knows our secret!

81
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,460
This is rottin' bad!

82
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,480
"I can't die" is like our secret code.

83
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,320
I don't wanna live in fear of death!

84
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,530
I heard that after a person loses his shadow,

85
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,390
he gets taken down this long staircase.

86
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,560
Right! Luffy got carried this way.

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,000
We were chasing after him when Nami...

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,170
Do you think Nami is okay?

89
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,430
It's not like he wants to kill her.

90
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,970
We'll save her when we come back!

91
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,780
That's all the more reason to hurry to Sunny!

92
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,220
We'll wake up Straw Hat and the
guys and recover their shadows!

93
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,190
But the island is infested
with zombies. That won't be easy!

94
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,220
Speaking of zombies,
how did you take them out?

95
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,010
That skeleton taught us how. We used this!

96
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,860
Here, guys, take this.

97
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,330
--What is it?
--The zombies' weakness!

98
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,780
You saw how effective it was in my
battle against this spider monkey!

99
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,160
This is their weakness? What exactly is it?

100
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,620
It's salt.

101
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,710
Zombies have a weakness?

102
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,910
So we can purify them if we
stuff salt into their mouths, huh?

103
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,550
You saw what happened!

104
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,400
By the way, what exactly was that
monstrous roar that came from upstairs?

105
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,520
Seriously! We followed that sound here.

106
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,640
That was Luffy's voice.

107
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,350
Say what?!

108
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,590
I'll tell you all about what we saw.

109
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,470
Long story short, we're in big trouble!

110
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,360
Keep it coming! He still wants more!

111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,790
How much does a Special Zombie eat?

112
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,910
He's going to consume
everything on the island!

113
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,760
He really stuffs his face...

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,400
Kumacy, why were you
harboring the pirates? Well?!

115
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,340
B-But I--

116
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,850
Don't talk! You're so not cute!

117
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,080
Sorry, Mini-Shallot!

118
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,170
You've been feeding me and I
don't even know who you are.

119
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,490
'Course, the quantity bites and the food's nasty.

120
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,870
Watch it, Special Zombie!
Don't step out of bounds!

121
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,970
Who do you think gifted us
with the ability to move?!

122
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,440
I wouldn't be so rude to the ruler
of Thriller Bark if I were you!

123
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,850
Someday the master is going
to become the King of the--

124
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,590
Eh?

125
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,410
I'm terribly sorry! He told me to say all of that.

126
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,550
Dude! Don't sell a friend out!

127
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm hungry! I want more!

128
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,620
Bring him more food.

129
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,520
But he's gobbled up nearly
all of the food on the island.

130
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,960
What?

131
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,360
We're storing food in the
treasure room in the basement.

132
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,070
Feel free to serve that.

133
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,070
That's my Cindry-chan!
Always prepared for anything!

134
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,280
--Great!
--I'm impressed that you set
aside emergency rations.

135
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,190
Huh? But if you give that to Oars,

136
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,590
it defeats the point of the emergency rations!

137
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,380
I hope we completely run out of food.

138
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,540
That's not nice, Cindry-chan!

139
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,730
Gyoro, Nin, Bao! Run over to
Hogback's mansion and get the food!

140
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,620
We're on it, Master!

141
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,010
We'll lend a helping hand!

142
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,730
Don't let those pirates find you!

143
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,670
Same goes for the Humming Swordsman.

144
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,400
If these guys could remove
the spider monkey's shadow,

145
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,770
they're super bad news!

146
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,350
Gaaah!

147
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,310
Is it the pirates?! The Humming Swordsman?!

148
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,780
I thought I dropped this,
but here it is! It's the basement key.

149
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,490
Don't scare us!

150
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,450
This leads to the basement!

151
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,730
Haul the stuff back up--all of it!

152
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,660
Yeah! Hurry! Hurry!

153
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,790
Master!

154
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,300
Feed him already!

155
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,540
Yes, sir!

156
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,900
This batch is actually pretty good.

157
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,300
A salted fish is somewhere in that pile.

158
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,860
I hope he eats it.

159
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,820
What?!

160
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,580
I-It's salted?!

161
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,580
If the Special Zombie eats that, its shadow will--

162
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,330
If that happens, the master
is going to let us have it!

163
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,580
We have to find it before he does!

164
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,040
Fish... Where is the fish?

165
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,490
P-P-Perona-sama...

166
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,260
Shut it! Don't say anything, Kumacy!

167
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,430
Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish!

168
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,140
What are you doing?

169
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,560
Help me!

170
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,550
Oh, it's a fish.

171
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,070
Is this salt?

172
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,020
Stupid!

173
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,450
This is it! I just know it!

174
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,840
Hide the thing!

175
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,120
That fish looks mighty yummy.

176
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,720
I-I don't think you'll find it to
your liking, Special Zombie-sama!

177
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,300
R-Right!

178
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,630
That's the sort of thing I
have to find out for myself.

179
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,680
What are you doing? Do you want
to get eaten along with the fish?

180
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,970
Shut up!

181
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,440
No matter what, don't let him eat this!

182
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,650
Hey! Why are you guys getting
between me and my fish?!

183
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,080
Ummm...

184
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,280
W-W-We thought this might taste better.

185
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,970
Right, right!

186
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,750
Yeah?

187
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,340
Dried meat! Yeah, it's really good!

188
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,790
I'm starving after all that hard work.

189
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,140
I think I'll help myself to some fish.

190
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,310
Shhh! Hush!

191
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,220
Listen, Oars! Five hundred years ago,
you left behind countless legends

192
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,780
as an infamous villain!

193
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,890
And just now, I resurrected you in
modern times to serve as my subordinate.

194
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,080
"Subordinate"? Forget it! I have a dream.

195
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,820
I've never heard of a zombie like this before!

196
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,780
This room is cramped and boring.

197
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,490
I'm gonna head on outside.

198
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,840
Maybe I'll set sail and travel
once around the world.

199
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,220
A voyage around the world?!

200
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,030
Moron! That's impossible!

201
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,900
This special freezer is encased in
a super thick wall made of steel!

202
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,880
You couldn't put a dent in--

203
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,990
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

204
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,030
He's amazing!

205
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,580
That's awesome!

206
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,650
W-W-Wait, dude!

207
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,300
This is rottin' bad! Oars has gone outside!

208
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,570
That's strange. I could have
sworn my arm could stretch.

209
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,680
Oh, well.

210
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,710
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

211
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,570
You are going to disgrace yourself by crying,

212
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,380
"Anything but my afro! Anything but my afro!"

213
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,540
as you beg me to spare
your life, just like last time.

214
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,370
No, that's not how it will go down!

215
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm getting nowhere!

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,880
I mustered the courage to strike
down those scary-looking zombies,

217
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,400
but they got right back up!

218
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,960
They must have some sort of weakness!

219
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,690
At this rate, I won't get my shadow back

220
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,830
even if I find my zombie!

221
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,660
And to top it off, zombies have
horrendously scary faces!

222
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,660
One of the guys got purified.

223
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,670
What happened?!

224
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,130
This picky eater just had
to grill the fish with salt!

225
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,850
--Huh?
--The idiot! He must have been new.

226
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,910
He grilled the fish with salt...?

227
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,060
Could this be the zombies' weakness?!

228
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,380
B-Bastard! We stole your shadow
the other day, Skeleton!

229
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,930
How did you get back?

230
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,980
Answer my question!

231
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,970
Which zombie did you stuff my shadow into?!

232
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,950
If you don't answer, I'll scatter
fish all across the island!

233
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,190
"Fish"?

234
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,410
So what if you scatter them around?

235
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,530
Huh? Uh, that's strange...

236
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,200
But it couldn't possibly be salt...

237
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,000
Eh? "Salt"?

238
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,340
S-S-So what if you s-s-scatter that around?

239
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,080
It's salt!

240
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,630
Zombies really are insanely scary!
I hate nighttime!

241
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,670
J-Jeez... It was just a grasshopper.

242
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,770
It gave me a fright.

243
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,390
But it's dangerous for me to
be out during daylight hours.

244
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,620
Plus it's easy for enemies to find me then.

245
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,060
I've got it! I'll sing!

246
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,790
When I'm scared, singing can
serve as a good distraction.

247
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,790
I'll be careful not to look at the
zombies' faces as I swiftly purify them.

248
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,460
I'm bound to run into my shadow eventually!

249
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,160
Where is that song coming from?

250
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,990
Who's humming?

251
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,450
Who're you?!

252
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,430
No!

253
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,350
What's the deal? What is
happening on this island?!

254
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,290
He appears out of the darkness while humming.

255
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:16,010
This scary-looking swordsman
is searching for his shadow!

256
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,060
He's wiped out practically
all of the Soldier Zombies!

257
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,330
Please do something!

258
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,910
Perona-sama, we have a problem.

259
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,680
Shut it! Don't wake me up, Kumacy!

260
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,750
Get up!

261
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,220
At last we meet!

262
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,930
Why is he so strong? Isn't this
zombie supposed to be me?

263
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,570
I can't keep up!
And here we use the same style!

264
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,280
Surrender!

265
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,450
It will end the same no matter
how many times you come after me.

266
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,310
If you would like to increase
your speed somewhat,

267
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,090
I shall cut that troublesome afro.

268
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,940
D-Don't! At the very least,
please leave my afro alone!

269
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,220
Anything but my hair!

270
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,690
Why don't you understand?!

271
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,630
If you're my shadow, why don't you
understand how important this afro is?

272
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,200
Time has stopped for my body,

273
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,010
so it would never grow back!

274
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:19,690
What of it? I have forgotten
all about the days I served you.

275
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,990
My current masters are
Moria-sama and Absalom-sama!

276
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,160
A skeleton that treasures its afro
is nothing short of ridiculous!

277
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,160
P-Please stop! Anything but my afro!
Anything but my afro!

278
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,300
Anything but my afro!
Not my afro! Not the 'fro!

279
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,630
That was a dirty move!
Are you not ashamed of yourself?!

280
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,460
Say what you will! There is a reason
why I cannot afford to lose!

281
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,770
You are most pathetic, former master.

282
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,690
I am sorry. I admit defeat...

283
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,400
Please let me go...

284
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,740
I will leave this island...

285
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,450
Then leave at once!

286
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,340
If you were to die, it would affect me as well.

287
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,200
That was the epitome of disgrace.

288
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,600
Say what you will!

289
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,810
While waiting for my chance to return,

290
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,700
I have spent these past five years...

291
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,200
...growing stronger!

292
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,950
Absalom-sama!

293
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,930
You better be ready to hold the wedding.

294
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,380
Yes, yes. We can start whenever you like.

295
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,860
My, what a lovely bride!

296
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,650
We're going to start right away!

297
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,460
Get her dressed and bring
her to the ceremony hall.

298
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,690
All right! I'm on it.

299
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,710
That right? So that skeleton
helped you out, huh?

300
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,040
And that's not all!

301
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,230
That punk said he's endured these past
fifty years to keep a promise with a friend.

302
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,450
A whale friend...

303
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,600
A-A whale...?

304
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

305
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,980
"A Man's Promise Never Dies!!
To the Friend Waiting Under the Distant Sky!"

306
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,120
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
