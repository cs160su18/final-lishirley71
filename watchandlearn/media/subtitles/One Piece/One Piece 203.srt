00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome treasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King of
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone dreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen through
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny is
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve your
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

17
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,150
Gum-Gum Balloon!

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,190
Nami?

19
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,840
We've been had...

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
Our treasure is gone!

21
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,480
"The Pirate Ship Disappears!
Fortress Battle, Round #2"

22
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,410
What?!

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,580
They're getting away! After them!

24
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,650
But Lt. Commander!

25
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,650
These are shallow waters, and we have
to go through the shore reef,

26
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,190
so all this smoke is dangerous!

27
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,270
I'm aware of that! And I don't care!

28
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,600
But...!

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,140
What if they make it onto the ocean outside?!

30
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,850
We'll wind up the laughingstock and
shame of the entire navy!

31
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,140
We-- the Navarone Fortress-- will?!

32
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,880
That's right! Those damn
navy bigwigs'll start arguing again

33
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,200
about destroying some
useless hedgehog of a fortress

34
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,890
that can't even capture a single
bug that snuck inside!

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,460
You! As a marine of the Navarone Fortress,
can you tolerate that?!

36
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,880
No, sir!

37
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,790
Attention, all warships!

38
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,450
Full speed ahead! Pass through the Sea Gate!

39
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,140
It's the outside ocean! We can get
out if we go straight ahead!

40
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,780
No, we can't leave!

41
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,130
Eh?

42
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,780
Take the ship back! Turn it around! Hurry!

43
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,140
We're going back into the fortress!The
navy stole all our gold!

44
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,720
Say what?!

45
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,990
A-Are you insane, Nami?! We almost
died trying to get this far!

46
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,900
I'm very sane!

47
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,460
Even if we do make it out,there's
no point without the gold!

48
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,690
When money is involved,she can
be strangely persuasive...

49
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,420
I love that side of Nami-san, too!

50
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,550
But we made that huge hole!Why
can't we just leave now?!

51
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,460
Aren't we pirates, Luffy?!

52
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:49,890
Yeah.

53
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,180
Don't you think pirates
leaving gold behind is shameful?!

54
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,930
Oh, right!

55
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,900
Good! Then it's decided!

56
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,690
Right rudder, full! Make a U-turn and
take us back into the fortress!

57
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,900
Right! Got it!

58
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,530
Yes! As you wish, Nami-san!

59
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,110
Right rudder, full!

60
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,980
U-turn!

61
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,320
Hold on, you guys!

62
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,370
What're you doing?!

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,990
Don't be reckless!

64
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,500
That's it, that's it! Keep it up!

65
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,170
Sound the alarm bell! Louder!

66
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,190
Can't see a thing in this smoke!Be
sure not to hit any fellow ships!

67
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,380
Something happen?

68
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,780
Quiet, Luffy!

69
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,580
Wind chimes?

70
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,920
These are alarm bells for signaling your
location to other ships in fog!

71
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,050
Oh, no! One's coming straight at us!

72
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,240
How's that? Is that good enough, Nami-san?!

73
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,490
No! Left rudder, full!

74
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,010
Eh?!

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,550
We have to change course or we'll crash!

76
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,810
Whatever you want, Nami-san!

77
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,070
We're gonna crash!

78
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,040
We almost wound up in pieces without
ever seeing the gold again...

79
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,960
How are things up ahead?

80
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,720
Not again...

81
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,360
There are lots more wind chimes than before!

82
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,690
There's one-- two-- no, even
more warships coming from the smoke!

83
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,730
What?!

84
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,460
Nami-san! What'll it be?
Left or right rudder?

85
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,960
More left!

86
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,140
We gotta get out of this smoke!

87
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,890
What the heck's going on?!

88
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,580
Just do what she says!She's the
best navigator in the world!

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,080
We're gonna crash for sure this time!

90
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,720
Please, God...!

91
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,480
We made it...

92
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,520
Keep going straight now!

93
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,880
We have to get out of this dangerous smoke
as quickly as possible!

94
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,750
They're gonna spot us, you know!

95
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,960
Yeah! We'll be sitting
ducks once we leave the smoke!

96
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,750
We'll get blasted and wind
up at the bottom of the ocean!

97
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,890
We'll just have to play it by ear!

98
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,150
Navigator...

99
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,760
Eh?

100
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,120
I did some research in the reference room--

101
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,660
this fortress actually used to
house many more people and warships.

102
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,430
Hey now, Robin! This is
no time for old stories!

103
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,530
It was military downsizing.They've
really fallen into decline since.

104
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,530
So it seems there are many unused
docks in this port.

105
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,850
Unused docks...

106
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,220
I see! That's some nice info, Robin!

107
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,040
Guys! We're gonna hide the
Going Merry in an old dock!

108
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,430
Eh?! And where exactly is that?!

109
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,620
Just follow my orders!

110
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,670
W-What?!

111
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,460
Call the cannoneers at the waterway!

112
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,020
Ask if the Straw Hat ship passed through!

113
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,520
Y-Yes, sir!

114
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,460
Attention, cannoneers!
This is Drake's flagship!

115
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,530
Have you seen the Straw Hats' ship?!

116
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,220
What?!

117
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,980
Apparently, no other ships have passed
through the Sea Gate yet!

118
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,260
What?!

119
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,080
Where did you disappear to, pirates?!

120
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,260
Don't tell me you managed to
sneak past the cannoneers

121
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,270
and vanish beyond the horizon in
that short period of time?!

122
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm very sorry!

123
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,530
We lost sight of the pirate ship once
it entered the outer waters!

124
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,860
It's almost as if they magically
turned invisible!

125
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,510
Just as I thought.

126
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,460
Sir?!

127
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,120
No, good work. Come on back for now.

128
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,870
We can talk leisurely
about our forthcoming plan.

129
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,200
They won't try to escape.

130
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,470
Not with their dreams
still in this fortress...

131
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,870
Unhand me!

132
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,030
Do you wanna be court-martialed for
insulting a superior officer?!

133
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,300
Hear that? He's gonna court-martial us!

134
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,870
Go ahead! Be our guest!

135
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,400
You two! Let that man go!

136
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,620
I'm so sorry, Major!

137
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,220
I told you so!

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,220
I am Major Shepherd, special inspector
for Navy Command!

139
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,980
I'd say the Straw Hats
are right around here...

140
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,860
I'd like to use them a little more.

141
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,260
I guess I'll wait for them to
come out on their own.

142
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,100
Those Straw Hat pirates have
us working like crazy...

143
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,700
Time for some good, energizing
grub,then it's back to searching.

144
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,540
What is this?! This isn't like
this morning's food!

145
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,750
Yeah! I'd never had anything like it before!

146
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,120
Hey! Don't be skimpin'! Give
us some grub like this morning's!

147
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,480
Give us good food! Give us good food!

148
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,030
Jessica-san! The soldiers
are complaining about their meals!

149
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,330
Give us good food! Give us good food!

150
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,100
Please, let us use those recipes!

151
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,710
Where has your pride
as cooks of Navarone gone?!

152
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,440
Jessica-san!

153
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,410
It's true that he was a pirate,but
he was still an excellent cook

154
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,980
who made food for the famished
soldiers who came here to eat!

155
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Yeah! All these men want to
be revitalized by eating his food!

156
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,430
Please make a decision! Please!

157
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,040
Please, Jessica-san!

158
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,910
Please!

159
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,890
We will make our own cooking

160
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,810
that's every bit as delicious and
replenishing as his!

161
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,110
But for today, we'll abandon our cheap
pride and borrow his recipes!

162
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,870
It's true that he wasn't a pirate
in the kitchen-- he was a cook.

163
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,960
What's most important of all is
satisfying the people eating!

164
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,500
Jessica-san!

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,830
What're you standing around
for?!Those men are waiting!

166
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,910
Right!

167
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,180
What do we do now, Nami?!

168
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,280
It's not too late yet.

169
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,880
We should go back to the gate
and get onto the ocean.

170
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,850
Yeah! These guys mean business!

171
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,180
It's a shame about the gold,but
our lives are more important!

172
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,840
What do you think, Luffy?

173
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,220
We need the gold! But
I'm hungry! Sanji! Food!

174
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,340
I'll look for some food and
make you somethin'.

175
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,400
The storeroom is empty.

176
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,440
There's gotta be something left somewhere.

177
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,210
Do you really think it's okay
to escape without getting the gold?!

178
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,570
Yes! Yes!

179
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,800
Well, that's a pity.Pirate
treasure is always divided up!

180
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,560
And given all that gold, we'd
each have gotten so much money!

181
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,720
Divided up?!

182
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,670
Naturally.

183
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,210
I've been waiting for this!I'm
gonna buy me a bronze statue!

184
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,250
Yeah! Can we buy books?!I want
the latest medical books!

185
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,610
I want to study all sorts of
medical techniques I don't know about!

186
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,790
New pots and frying pans,plus
silverware and giant mousetraps...

187
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,160
That leaves a crapload left over!

188
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,080
I could drink all I want!

189
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:17,910
Right?!

190
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,150
Yeah! Yeah!

191
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,120
First, my stash will be 80%!

192
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,910
Hold on a second!

193
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,540
Just kidding.

194
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,880
Obviously! You can't just openly
have a secret stash!

195
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:35,850
By "stash," I mean money saved
up to repair the ship!

196
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,550
The ship? You mean Merry?

197
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,120
That's right. The Going Merry is what
brought us where we are now.

198
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,810
Come to think of it,

199
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:50,830
it has given us a ride on the seas ever
since my East Blue village...

200
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,170
It's a slightly older model,but
I personally designed it!

201
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,500
A carvel-make caravel, with lateen
sails and a central stern rudder...

202
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,540
The Going Merry!

203
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,630
Get on already.

204
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,450
Eh?!

205
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,620
We're friends now, aren't we?

206
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,880
I...

207
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,130
I get to be captain, right?!

208
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,840
Don't be dumb! I'm the captain!

209
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,440
We've made so many memories with this ship...

210
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,830
I'm thinking of leaving this island!

211
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,740
I'm... going now.

212
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,040
I'll be back someday!

213
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,590
And it was with us when
we crossed Reverse Mountain

214
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,610
and burst onto the Grand Line...

215
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,160
This can't be real!

216
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,840
The ocean really is flowing up it!

217
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,020
We made it!

218
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,880
We're going into the clouds!

219
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,600
I see it! This is the greatest
sea in the world! The Grand Line!

220
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,460
The One Piece is up ahead, somewhere!

221
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,260
Go!

222
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,900
And then the sky islands...

223
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,960
Who's this ship's navigator?!

224
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,820
You are, Nami-san!

225
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,040
All right, men! Do what Nami-san says!

226
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,190
Right!

227
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,810
We're flying!

228
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,380
Awesome! The ship is flying!

229
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,890
Nami-san! You're wonderful!

230
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,620
And I like you!

231
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,760
And I even risked my life to protect it!

232
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,070
Stop it! Stop it!

233
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,240
Please don't harm the ship!

234
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,130
Dammit!

235
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,590
And then someone fixed the ship for us...

236
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,560
I really saw it!

237
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,840
When you think about it,this
ship's been through a lot!

238
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,330
It's done so much for us,but
now it's all beat up.

239
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,320
Good idea! The Going Merry's Great Repair!

240
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,620
I'm all for it!

241
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,070
Okay, then. Since we don't know
how much it'll cost,

242
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,060
we'll hold off on dividing up the
treasure when we get it back.

243
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,800
They took most of the food,but
not the stuff in the fridge.

244
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,420
Dig in.

245
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,630
Yeah. Usopp's cheap repairs are
just about at their limit.

246
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,760
I'll have you know that I'm a sniper!

247
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,250
But yeah, Mechao-san said the same
thing-- that it needs real repairs.

248
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,110
Yeah. We should go to a
real shipbuilding dock

249
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,550
and have real shipwrights fix it for us.

250
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,280
There are people better than you
at fixing ships, Usopp?

251
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,090
Sometimes you gotta take extra good care,

252
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,610
or you'll wind up paying for it later!

253
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,650
All right, it's decided!

254
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,590
Let's get a shipwright in our crew!

255
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,820
Our journey is far from over!

256
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,570
Yes!

257
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,760
We need those skills anyway...

258
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,450
Yes, yes!

259
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,470
And Merry is our home! Our life!

260
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,340
Let's find a shipwright who can keep it safe!

261
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,360
There he goes again...

262
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,830
Yeah, on rare occasion,he
gets straight to the point.

263
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,980
That's the best way! Let's do it!

264
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,180
Okay, then that's the plan!

265
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,470
I hope we find someone good!

266
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,240
And we need a musician, too!

267
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,450
No, just forget about that.

268
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,910
It's nice to be all excited, but
have you forgotten what comes first?

269
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,200
What's that?

270
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,560
We have to get our gold back!

271
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,560
Oh, right.

272
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,800
Question is, where's it hidden?

273
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,430
In a vault, most likely.

274
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,780
We know that! The problem
is,we don't know where it is!

275
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,380
You don't hafta yell at me!

276
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,380
Wouldn't it be here?

277
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,970
It's only a guess, but if I were to
hide gold in this fortress,

278
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,350
this multi-lock storage vault seems
like the only place to do it.

279
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,500
Eh?!

280
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,040
You're so smart, Robin-chan!

281
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,440
Yeah, that does seem the most likely!

282
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,810
All right, guys! Let's go
there and get our gold back!

283
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,830
But are we just gonna leave the Going
Merry here? It'll get spotted!

284
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,340
"Hide a tree in a forest!
Hide a ship in ships!"

285
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,120
What, that's it?

286
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,300
You shouldn't try to get
too serious that often.

287
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,490
These are the remains of a dock
where ships were built and repaired.

288
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,560
When we came in just now, I saw
plenty of abandoned materials.

289
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,460
Aha! I have a great idea!

290
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,760
Whisper, whisper, whisper!

291
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,480
All right?! Help me out, guys!

292
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,980
Yeah!

293
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,930
Whadya think?!

294
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:30,840
At least now we don't have to worry
about it being stolen again!

295
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,660
Gluing paper all over the Going
Merry was a great idea.

296
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,260
But I dunno how long it'll fool people,

297
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,480
given how crappily it's been done...

298
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,430
Yep! This is definitely a
navy warship, no doubt about it!

299
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,040
Yeah!

300
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,450
You serious?!

301
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,360
All right, then! Now to get our gold back!

302
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,180
Everyone! We commence tonight
at midnight! Got that?!

303
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,160
Yeah!

304
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,420
But why don't we go now?

305
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,710
'Cause the mood'll be better
at night, obviously!

306
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,090
Oh! Mood! I see!

307
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,120
No, I don't think that's quite why.

308
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

309
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

310
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

311
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

312
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

313
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

314
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

315
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,170
Now we don't have to worry about
Merry, but hold on, you guys!

316
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,410
Are you just gonna go like this?!

317
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,710
Geez! Seven people running around
will stand out too much!

318
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,390
Here! I'll give you my super secret plan!

319
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,090
On the next One Piece!

320
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,300
I do this part!

321
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,620
On the next episode of One Piece!

322
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,820
"The Gold and Waver Recovery Operations!"

323
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,490
I'm gonna be a brave warrior of the sea!

324
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,440
You too?!
