2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,430
To rescue his brother Ace who
has been captured by the navy,

50
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,910
Luffy stowed away on a navy ship with
the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock's help.

51
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,760
I'm sure that you
heard about Luffy.

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,510
He picked a fight with the World
Government at Water Seven

53
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,330
and destroyed the Judgement
Island - Enies Lobby!

54
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,920
Oh yeah. I told Luffy
about his father.

55
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,150
Luffy was surprised to
know about his father.

56
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,090
It doesn't matter to us at all.

57
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,810
Because Luffy and
I unfortunately

58
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,300
have the blood of the world's most
infamous criminal in our veins anyway.

59
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,320
There was no way for
us to become marines.

60
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,990
I took over the name "Portgaz" from
my mother to whom I owe so much

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,590
but I never wanted to have my
good-for-nothing father's blood.

62
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,650
Because I don't have any memory of
him and I don't owe anything to him.

63
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,290
Ah yeah, I understand
but he tried...

64
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,630
What I want to say is...

65
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,260
Old man...

66
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,970
Run as wild as you want
on the sea under my name.

67
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,340
You are my son from now!

68
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,060
My only father is...

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,190
Whitebeard!

70
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,210
You better just give up.

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,990
Buggy the Clown's luck
as a pirate has run out.

72
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,910
That can't be true!

73
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,080
This is not the way
Captain Buggy will die!

74
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,300
This is the world's
greatest prison!

75
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,090
Welcome to my Impel Down!

76
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,260
Oh, I got it wrong! I said
"my" - jumping the gun!

77
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm still the vice warden,
Hannyabal. Nice to meet you!

78
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,650
Now, let's just start.

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,260
Let me put these Sea Prism
Stone handcuffs on you.

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,780
I'm not a prisoner but you put handcuffs
on me. You couldn't be more careful.

81
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,120
Public execution of Ace...

82
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,280
...is in 33 hours!

83
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,040
"A Reunion in Hell?! The Man
Who Ate the Chop-Chop Fruit!"

84
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,150
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs...

85
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,970
Put out your hands.

86
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,730
Please don't hurt me!

87
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,020
W-What's wrong?!

88
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,820
Come out, Luffy!

89
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,200
That was close!

90
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,290
I was thinking of taking a risk
and sneaking out very quick but

91
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,040
you can turn
anything to stone!

92
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,510
It looks like I can't go
any farther with you.

93
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,470
I can't use my power while
wearing those Sea Prism cuffs.

94
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,850
And they'll take my cloak
away so I can't hide you.

95
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,180
I wish I could do more but...

96
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,440
What're you talking about? I wouldn't
have made it this far without your help!

97
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,400
I was able to get in even though the
building is surrounded. I'll be fine!

98
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,770
Luffy.

99
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,870
They built this place as a
fort that locks people in.

100
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't get in any trouble.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,380
Once they catch you, you'll
never be able to get out.

102
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,970
I know that you're strong

103
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,590
but promise me that you
won't get in any trouble.

104
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,970
Alright! I promise!

105
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,810
Thank you so
much, Hancock!

106
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,730
I won't forget what you've
done for me. I owe you!

107
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,020
Did you just call
me Hancock?!

108
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,780
Alright, I got you, Hammock!

109
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,990
Can I have more,
Hammock?!

110
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,080
What're you
doing, Hammock?

111
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,580
Hancock!

112
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,250
Now I can die happily!

113
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,140
Hey! You can revert
them now! I'll be fine!

114
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,810
Finally, he loves me back!

115
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,900
Hey!

116
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,720
It's taking too long.

117
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,320
I think she's being careful about doing it
because Hancock is an important figure.

118
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,760
A thorough body search...

119
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,270
Wow! Do you think that's
what they're doing?!

120
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,210
What are you imagining?!

121
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,360
Beep! Beep!

122
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,000
Vice Warden Hannyabal!

123
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,340
We're not getting any visuals from the snail in
that room! Is something going on in there?!

124
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,180
Domino! Something wrong?

125
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,520
She's not answering.

126
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,510
On the pretext of checking what's
going on in the room as a vice warden,

127
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,280
this is a chance for me to
see Hancock's body search!

128
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,240
Hey!

129
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,910
The body search is done!

130
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,380
Beep! Beep!

131
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,870
We're getting visuals
again! Everything is fine!

132
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,210
I'm sorry. Did I take
too much time?

133
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,530
What? No no!

134
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,130
Everything is fine here, too!

135
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not happy with
this. I'm not a prisoner.

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,280
Who do you think I am?

137
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,230
I'm sorry. But that's the
rule here at Impel Down.

138
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,980
It's strange. Feels like I've
lost a part of my memory...

139
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,790
Lead the way now!

140
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,320
Alright then, let's
take the big elevator.

141
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,740
We're gonna go
down to level 4,

142
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,860
the Burning Heat Floor
where Warden Magellan is.

143
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,920
It's hot there so be prepared.

144
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,220
Luffy!

145
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Good luck!

146
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,120
Thank you!

147
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,100
W-What's the matter?!

148
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,030
"Thank You"

149
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,730
"I...

150
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,300
...love...

151
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,490
...you"!

152
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,010
He said "I love you"!

153
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,510
--Hey!
--Hancock-dono! What's wrong?!

154
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,290
Are you alright?!

155
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,860
What happened to
her all of sudden?

156
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,350
Now, where should I go?

157
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,370
He said that the elevator was
going down to the basement.

158
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,020
And Hancock said that Ace
might be held underwater.

159
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,380
Oh yeah!

160
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,770
This Vivre Card would
help at a time like this!

161
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,430
It's this way!

162
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,210
Blugoris are returning!

163
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,140
They got food!
Open the hatch!

164
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,810
--Good job!
--Take the meat to the refrigeration room!

165
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,690
Are you awake? We'll pass
through level 1 shortly.

166
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,670
Help me!

167
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,340
It's worse than I expected.

168
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,960
You can't be serious.

169
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,540
This floor only contains
prisoners with light sentences.

170
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,850
--What?
--She's right.

171
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,640
Level 1 of Impel Down
is the Crimson Floor.

172
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,200
Why is it "Crimson"?

173
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,690
That's a secret!

174
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,020
Next up, level 2 is the Floor
of Wild Beasts from Hell.

175
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,480
Level 3 in the basement
is the Starvation Floor.

176
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,550
And level 4 that we're heading
to is the Burning Heat Floor.

177
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,200
It's gonna take a
while to get to level 4.

178
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,190
In the meantime, you'll hear the
pleasant screams of prisoners

179
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,130
so please enjoy it.

180
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,590
Is "Fire Fist" Ace in level 4?

181
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,810
No, he isn't. We have more levels
than that and "Fire Fist" Ace is...

182
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,180
Luffy...

183
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,850
Ace should be
down these stairs!

184
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,030
Hey, you cheater!

185
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,530
You didn't tell us that you
had that kind of ability!

186
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,790
Shut up!

187
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,690
Being tortured every day and night
here is like dying a thousand deaths!

188
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,500
Are you gonna just
run out on us?!

189
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,540
Huh?! I don't remember
making friends with you.

190
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,030
I'm like a free, wild eagle! If you don't
like it, why don't you do what I did!

191
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,950
Oh, you can't! Then you
have to die like a dog!

192
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,680
--Kiss my ass!
--I'll get you someday!

193
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,370
Buggy!

194
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,150
I already forgot about you!

195
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,010
A Surveillance
Transponder Snail?!

196
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,990
Good evening!

197
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,860
We found him!

198
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,600
Buggy the Clown who escaped
from community cell #4 of level 1...

199
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,040
...is in the hallway in
front of solitary cell #22!

200
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,920
Get him now!

201
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,000
Damn! They found me!

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,210
You bastard!

203
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,510
Shit!

204
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,520
Surveillance Transponder
Snail #71 has been shut off!

205
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,390
Did you hear
that? It's Buggy!

206
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,520
That's what happens when you try to
escape alone! That serves him right!

207
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,880
He's gonna get the
worst punishment!

208
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,770
Here comes Blugoris!

209
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,190
Go for it!

210
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,610
Get him!

211
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,160
This Vivre Card keeps
leading me down but...

212
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,350
...it's a dead end.

213
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,940
It's prisoner #8200!

214
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,800
Don't let him get away!

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,590
He was hiding the fact that he ate Devil
Fruit! Don't forget a Sea Prism Stone!

216
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,970
Hurry up!

217
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,000
Split into two and get
him from both sides!

218
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,690
Yes! Made it!

219
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,900
Hurry up!

220
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,980
What happened?

221
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,280
"Level 1: Crimson Floor"

222
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,030
Are these all cells?

223
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,040
A scream? Forget it
- I gotta get going!

224
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,590
Go away! Jerks!

225
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,470
Help me!

226
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,860
This way!

227
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,350
They're gone!

228
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,840
"DANGER"? It's not like
anyone is gonna touch it...

229
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,660
What the...?!

230
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,210
Wait!

231
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,560
That was close!

232
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,650
I didn't see that coming!

233
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,360
Hey! The traps over
here have gone off!

234
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,030
Oh no! Somebody's coming!

235
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,030
Stop!

236
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,750
Let's go!

237
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,500
Oh? Looks like they
aren't coming. Oh, well!

238
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,430
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

239
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,430
Young man!

240
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,750
What?!

241
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,010
Wait a minute! How
did you get out?

242
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,560
What's the matter?

243
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,740
Get out? I got
in from outside!

244
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,850
Okay, bye!

245
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,690
Wait, wait! Quit lying, you!

246
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,450
It's true!

247
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,440
Who are you? You don't look
like a jailer or something.

248
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,240
Why aren't you behind bars?

249
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,950
Man, you guys are irritating!

250
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,290
Oh yeah! Do you
know where Ace is?

251
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,120
Ace?

252
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,630
This Ace that you're
talking about is...

253
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,540
"Fire Fist" Ace?!

254
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,420
Yeah! I'm here to rescue him!

255
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,050
That's impossible!

256
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,760
Yeah, I heard that
he just got in.

257
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,790
They must have put him on level
5. You can't get anywhere near it!

258
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,560
Impossible!

259
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,880
That floor holds all the criminals with
bounties of hundreds of millions or more!

260
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,990
Level 5?

261
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,590
By the way, young man,

262
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,220
can you run to the jailers'
room and bring us some keys?

263
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,410
Yeah! Please, young man!

264
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:52,610
It must be fate that brought
us together in this big world!

265
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,210
Right?

266
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,880
W-What's that?

267
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,990
That's Blugori!

268
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,140
Blugori?

269
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,430
Run, young man!
They're gonna get you!

270
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,560
Augh! What're those?!

271
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,190
Right side!

272
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,190
Left side!

273
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,530
Unite!

274
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,410
You fools! Don't mess with
a Chop-Chop Fruit eater!

275
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,710
Wow! Straw Hat!

276
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,050
What're you doing here?!

277
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,810
Oh, it's just Buggy.

278
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,160
Right! Shut up! You asshole!

279
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,530
You're as annoying as ever!

280
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,180
I didn't know that
they also got you!

281
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,070
I came here on my own
will! No one got me!

282
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,830
Nobody comes to a
prison on his own will!

283
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,440
Ah? Don't tell me that you
heard that I was captured

284
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,250
and that you came
here to rescue me...

285
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,810
No way! Stupid!
That's gross!

286
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,170
Cut it out! Bastard!

287
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,220
I promised Hancock that I
wouldn't get into any trouble

288
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,720
but you got me involved!

289
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,470
It's not like I'm
enjoying this situation!

290
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,230
Let me go!

291
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,070
Buggy's Peaceful Escape
Plan is officially ruined!

292
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,120
Who gives a shit?

293
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,060
They're ahead of us, too!

294
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,890
Damn it all!

295
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,180
Hey! Should we just fight?!

296
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,080
What're you
thinking, stupid?!

297
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,440
You don't know how painful
all the torture's been!

298
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,640
They're so cold-blooded!

299
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
--Doesn't matter if we don't get caught!
--What're you talking about?

300
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,530
I gotta hurry! My cover's
already been blown!

301
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:36,140
That's what I don't like
about you and Red-Haired!

302
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,670
You guys always stay
positive in a bad sense!

303
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,700
Alright! I'll do it!

304
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,420
I have no choice!

305
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,390
I'll change my plan!

306
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,110
Now for some chaos!

307
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm with you!

308
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,420
Luffy joins up with Buggy,

309
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,250
and they use Buggy's Chop-Chop
Fruit power to get through

310
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,130
the prison and find Ace's floor.

311
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,570
But level 1 of the prison, the Crimson Hell,

312
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,930
shows its terrifying true
form and impedes their path.

313
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

314
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,980
"Break through the Crimson Hell!
Buggy's Chaos-Inducing Plan!"

315
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,250
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
