2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,710
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,170
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,010
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,400
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,610
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,150
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,900
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,490
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,510
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,440
Their total bounty exceeds 600 million Berries.

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,100
This Jolly Roger belongs to the Straw Hat Crew.

49
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,650
What do you think with your
120 million bounty, Roronoa Zoro?

50
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,450
How the hell did you get that Jolly Roger?!

51
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:53,460
"A Mansion in Chaos! An Enraged Don
and an Imprisoned Crew"

52
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,130
Luffy...

53
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,380
Luffy!

54
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,970
That was close! But I'm not
about to fall into the ocean!

55
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,310
How far can you run?

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,940
You may have a 300-million-Berry bounty,
but you're nothing before us!

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,360
I've had enough of your yapping!
Give back our Jolly Roger!

58
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,070
I'm willing to lead the way.

59
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,200
If you can defeat us brothers...

60
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,700
...we'll take you to that flag.

61
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,830
Jerks!

62
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,670
I nearly fell!

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,670
Having a hard time fighting on the ice?

64
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,550
It's just as tricky for you!

65
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,970
I wouldn't be so sure.

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,390
The Arctic Path falls under
the Accino Family's territory.

67
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,400
When we're in unison, no one here
stands a chance against us!

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,440
Furthermore, we have the power
of magnetism that strongly unites us!

69
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,610
Monkey D. Luffy, you're doomed
to succumb to our brotherly love!

70
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,950
I've heard enough of your boasting.
Just come at me already!

71
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,830
I'll kick your butts in no time flat!

72
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,790
What a brat!

73
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,040
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

74
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,640
Monkey D. Luffy, we siblings...

75
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,430
...will be taking your head!

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,390
I'm amazed you were able to dodge that!

77
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,690
Let's get him in one go,
Big Brother Campaccino!

78
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,940
Papa is growing anxious.

79
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,990
It's the end of--

80
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,030
You really are in perfect unison!

81
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,120
Don't laugh!

82
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,160
I should have expected as much
from a 300-million-Berry bounty.

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,750
You really did a number on us!

84
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,210
Nah, I haven't done anything yet.
Are you stupid or what?

85
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,050
The pirate scum...!

86
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,920
How dare he mock us?!

87
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,090
Curse you!

88
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,300
Die!

89
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,670
Jerk! How dare you get rough
with my Shark Submerge?!

90
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,380
I'm gonna make you pay
for that, you hockey freak!

91
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,640
It's only a matter of time before you turn to ice!

92
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,180
Keep the bravado up while you can!

93
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,270
Punk!

94
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,980
This sucks! Where the heck are we?!

95
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,940
Hey!

96
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,650
Sanji-kun! Usopp!

97
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,360
Please save us!

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,860
Nami-san, I'm sorry.
I let my guard down just a bit.

99
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,950
Hey, are you okay?

100
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,830
Yeah, thanks. You're a lifesaver.

101
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,160
Now we're down to four bounties left.

102
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,420
I just knew you were bounty hunters!

103
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,920
But, dang, this place is freezing!

104
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,380
This was carved from layers of ice that
have been forming for hundreds of years.

105
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,760
It quickly freezes anything that is inside.
You could say it's a natural freezer.

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,970
Make sense?

107
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,480
Arbell, that comparison was really great!
It was super easy to understand!

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,190
I can't wait to see whether
we'll catch the other four first

109
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,110
or you'll freeze first!

110
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,620
By now, my children should
have taken out your crewmates.

111
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,130
It's a pity! I hate to slice apart
the guy who treated me to a drink!

112
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,880
You, slice me apart? Are you up to the task?

113
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,230
You're a Devil Fruit power holder?!

114
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,980
I can melt anything I touch!

115
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,150
I could do this to your splendid
sword in mere seconds!

116
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,240
I gained this ability from my Hot-Hot Fruit!

117
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,700
In other words, I just can't touch you, right?

118
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,750
Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

119
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,800
What?!

120
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,780
Bastard! Are you trying to
hurt my beloved collection?!

121
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,950
Wh-What was that?!

122
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,880
Troisième Haché!

123
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,590
Strong... Hammer!

124
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,300
Exploding Star! Exploding Star Star!

125
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,760
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Rubberband of Doom!

126
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Exploding Star! Pound!

127
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,350
--Exploding Star! Exploding Star Star!
--You're wasting your time.

128
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,060
There is no way out. Give it up.

129
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,900
--Hammer! Exploding Star! Pound!
--It looks like that is the only way out.

130
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,020
--Exploding Star! Exploding Star!
--Franky!

131
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,070
Dammit! I wasn't even able to dent it!

132
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
I guess I'll call it a day.

133
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,700
Hey!

134
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,040
What's up?

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,000
C'mon! Do "that."

136
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,000
Sure! I should have enough for one last blast.

137
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,090
Let's go, guys! Everyone ready?!

138
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,970
Yeah!

139
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,630
1.0 Cola Cannon!

140
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,100
Coup de Boo!

141
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,180
Go!

142
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,810
Dammit! I'm outta cola!

143
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,310
No, you got us far enough!

144
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,150
Damn it!

145
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,240
Don't underestimate us!

146
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,530
Hurry and freeze over!

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Click.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,710
I-It's horrible, Arbell-sama!
D-Don Accino-sama is...!

149
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,050
Understood. I'm on my way!

150
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,680
Stay there and wait for the others to show up!

151
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,180
Hurry it up, Darling!

152
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
Coming, Honey!

153
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,190
Hey, we're seriously gonna
freeze if we stay here!

154
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,360
Papa-san!

155
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Papa!

156
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,320
Yeah!

157
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,280
--This isn't good!
--It's like a sauna in here!

158
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,700
Honey, what should we do?

159
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,370
We can't let Papa's mood
get any worse! Put on a smile!

160
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,500
What's the matter, Papa?

161
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,500
You brats!

162
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,960
Didn't you make sure to gather
up my birthday presents?!

163
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,100
Listen to me, Papa! We've gathered them--gah!

164
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,430
R-Roronoa Zoro?!

165
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,770
What's he doing here?

166
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,440
I won't forgive you, bastard!

167
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,650
Don't ignore us!

168
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,150
Two-Sword Style!

169
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,900
--Uh, if I remember right...
--Hawk...

170
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,780
...Wave?!

171
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,830
I-I'm sorry, Papa!

172
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,330
We made a mistake that
allowed one to slip through.

173
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,290
P-Papa-san, don't worry! We'll be sure
to do a perfect job rounding up the rest!

174
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,720
And you got a new flag
to add to your collection!

175
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,130
See? So cheer up!

176
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,510
And my brothers-in-law will hunt
down the remaining members!

177
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,600
Okay, Papa?

178
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,350
It's not working. We can't
soothe his temper on our own.

179
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,650
Help us, Brother!

180
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,370
Damn it! You're tougher than
I expected, Clone Technique Guy!

181
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,830
We told you, we're twins!
Listen to what people tell you!

182
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,920
Now then, Papa is waiting for us.
We need to wrap this up.

183
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,500
Wha--?!

184
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,590
Blend!

185
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,050
Big Brother Campaccino!

186
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,430
Damn it!

187
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,640
Monkey D. Luffy!

188
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,810
Your head is ours!

189
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,700
Gum-Gum...

190
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,570
...Gatling!

191
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,130
Click.

192
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,050
What is it?

193
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,840
Yeah. Yeah...

194
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,720
--All right.
--Click.

195
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,720
Hey, you! Don't run from me!

196
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,810
You've escaped death
for now, Monkey D. Luffy.

197
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,020
We'll finish you off later.

198
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,940
Big Brother, what's the matter?

199
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,610
It sounds like Papa has gotten
even worse! We have to hurry back.

200
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,030
Wait, you two! Don't run away!

201
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,040
You jerks!

202
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,000
Give back our Jolly Roger!

203
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,230
Stop it! You'll die if you go to sleep!
Wake up, Usopp! Usopp!

204
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,810
Don't wake me up, Nami.
I'm in the middle of a pretty dream...

205
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,190
There's so many birdies and butterflies...

206
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,740
Merry, you've come for me, haven't you?

207
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,030
Wake up!

208
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,540
Are you trying to kill me?!

209
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,040
Where the heck is this?

210
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,550
Zoro?!

211
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,590
Where the hell have you guys been?

212
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,670
That's what we should be asking you!

213
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,140
More importantly, I saw our flag upstairs.

214
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,390
Guys, you didn't...

215
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,100
So it really is here, huh?

216
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,730
We've gotta get it back before Luffy notices!

217
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,650
Damn it! You can't even protect a
single flag, you lame excuse for a cook?

218
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,320
Back at you! How dare you come back
empty-handed, you shitty swordsman?!

219
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,620
--Jerk, take this!
--Hey, watch where you fling that sword!

220
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,830
Hey! This is no time for fighting!

221
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,620
It looks like everyone is doing well.

222
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,960
Huh?

223
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,170
Robin!

224
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,040
Robin-chan!

225
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,880
--Moron.
--What?!

226
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,090
Robin, save me!

227
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,720
Please! Pull us up!

228
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,220
Really, Miss, you're supposed
to go down there with them.

229
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,020
But see, you're special, Big Sister Robin!

230
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,350
I'll ask Papa to spare you.

231
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,190
And Papa does anything I ask!

232
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,900
My!

233
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,570
So let's go to the birthday party.

234
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,650
There's a birthday party?

235
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,990
Yup! It's for Papa!
We have a whole bunch of food!

236
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,450
C'mon! Say goodbye to everyone.

237
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,500
--Robin!
--Hey!

238
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,670
Darling!

239
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,670
--Hurry and rescue us!
--C'mon! Hurry and save us! Robin!
--Robin-chan! Darling!

240
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,710
Hey! Robin-chan! Come on!

241
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,470
Well, shall we head on up?

242
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,470
Really?

243
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,220
Let's go! Let's go!

244
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,600
I'll lead the way.

245
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,940
Hey! Why'd you leave us?

246
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,150
Wait, Robin!

247
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,360
Please don't abandon me!

248
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,860
Chopper!

249
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,580
I'm back!

250
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,330
Come back like a normal person!

251
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,210
Are you trying to destroy our ship?!

252
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,710
My bad.

253
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,180
What's the matter?

254
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,390
Isn't it a bit warm?

255
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,100
Huh? It couldn't be...

256
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,140
I knew it!

257
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,810
Papa's angry!

258
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:32,780
Let's call it off. It's best to stay away
from Papa when he gets like that.

259
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,650
Really?

260
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,110
At this rate, he'll melt everyone around here!

261
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,530
C'mon! Let's go play in my room.

262
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,410
Then let's take those snacks and drinks with us.

263
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,670
They're so warm, I doubt they'll be very yummy.

264
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,010
That's all right. Also, I'd like
to ask a favor of you.

265
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,890
Punks, you've got a delivery.

266
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,470
It's from Little Lady Lil's friend, Robin-sama.

267
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,640
From Robin?

268
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,900
A delivery...?

269
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,900
Robin-chan, I always believed in you!

270
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,160
Hey! Here's some cola, Franky!

271
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,280
Sweet! You can leave the rest to me!

272
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,510
Super! Cola replenished!

273
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,800
Here I go! Coup de...

274
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,510
...Vent!

275
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,600
Coup de Boo!

276
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,190
We wasted a bunch of time down there,
so let's get going, guys!

277
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,030
Yeah!

278
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,910
Let's go, Chopper!

279
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,490
Yeah!

280
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,620
Please take me with you.

281
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,250
I'm begging you!

282
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,040
Jiro...

283
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,580
Forget it!

284
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,790
Stay here, Jiro.

285
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,250
--Don't go!
--Captain...

286
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,760
There's no need to go.

287
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,590
I'm no longer...

288
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,390
It's okay! If we could raise
our Jolly Roger again,

289
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,430
I'm sure you'd return to your old self!

290
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,060
So I'm going to bring it back!

291
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,600
Don't be foolish!

292
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,020
I have already given up...

293
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,900
The words "given up" sound so lame...

294
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,370
They don't suit you, Captain!

295
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,950
You're the man who's supposed
to become the King of the Pirates!

296
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,330
Puzzle, I believe in you.

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,710
You are the man who will
become the King of the Pirates!

298
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:09,470
I'm still puny and a total weakling,
but just you wait!

299
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,100
I'll steal it back and--

300
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,440
--Wha--?!
--Eh?!

301
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,610
Why'd you whack him, Luffy?!

302
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,030
Don't exclude me from the conversation!

303
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,900
Are you a cold-hearted brute?!

304
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,820
That hurt! What was that for?!

305
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,620
Only someone who has fought till the
very end may use the words "given up."

306
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,160
You can't use them!

307
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,620
Listen to me!

308
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,170
There is no way a guy like this could
become the King of the Pirates!

309
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,170
I'm the one who'll become
the King of the Pirates!

310
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,340
Don't be stupid!

311
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,970
I've already decided that Puzzle-san
is going to become the King!

312
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,380
I don't care what you say!

313
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,930
I won't give up on my dream!

314
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,060
Hey!

315
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,070
Jiro, you aren't weak at all!

316
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,290
You've got an inner strength!

317
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,660
Luffy-san...

318
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,840
C'mon! Let's go get our flags back, Jiro!

319
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,630
Yeah!

320
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,470
I'll never forgive them for
stealing our Jolly Rogers!

321
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,010
Don't do it!

322
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,140
You don't stand a chance against them!

323
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,600
Don't go.

324
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,270
I'm not going to die.
I'm going to move forward.

325
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,110
After all, I'm a pirate!

326
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:50,450
The idiot...! All for me, everyone is...

327
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,340
Captain Puzzle...

328
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,890
Men, we're going after Jiro!

329
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,350
R-Right...

330
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,860
Hey, Nami! Aren't we in trouble
if Zoro is leading the way?

331
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,480
Shut your trap!

332
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,490
I'm sure we'll turn this into a
party you'll never forget, okay?

333
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,160
So cheer up, Papa!

334
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,790
Give our Jolly Roger back!

335
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,220
What was that?

336
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,430
Hey, don't drag your feet! Luffy's on his way!

337
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,260
At any rate, let's hurry!

338
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,030
See? I told you he'd come, Papa!

339
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,820
It's just a matter of time before we capture him.

340
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,330
I'm sorry I got mad at you.

341
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,260
Hey, you damn moss head!

342
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,090
I only followed you since you claimed
to know where the Jolly Roger was!

343
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,880
Back off! Be quiet for a second!

344
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,140
It's probably this way.

345
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,100
Why the heck do we have to follow this jerk?

346
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,930
We're here! This is it!

347
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,270
I'm sure of it...

348
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

349
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,940
"The Phoenix Returns! The Dream
Sworn to Friends on a Jolly Roger"

350
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
