2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,330
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,180
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,610
Seeking a ship coating craftsman
to help them reach Fishman Island,

51
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,790
the Straw Hat crew landed
on the Sabaody Archipelago,

52
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,360
where they met Rayleigh, a craftsman

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,520
and the former vice-captain
of the Roger Pirates.

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,420
Luffy and company had decided to
hide while Rayleigh coats the Sunny,

55
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,730
when Bartholomew Kuma,
one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea,

56
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,010
appeared before them.

57
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,510
Three-Sword Style...

58
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,440
...Gum-Gum...

59
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,310
...Diable...

60
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,180
...Mouton...

61
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,300
...Jet...

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,310
...600 Pound...

63
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,270
...Cannon!

64
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,120
However, Zoro had doubts about this Kuma...

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,590
If this is a fake, then
that's the real problem.

66
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,880
That'd mean there are two
guys who're this strong.

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,430
Meanwhile, the rookies
took on Admiral Kizaru,

68
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,980
an assassin sent by Navy Headquarters, but...

69
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,910
This is Borsalino.

70
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,800
What the hell, Uncle! You do
have a Baby Transponder Snail!

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,780
Why didn't you contact me?!

72
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,670
Oh?

73
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,060
Oh, Sentomaru-kun!

74
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,750
Don't give me, "Oh!" What are you doing?!

75
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,870
You're on the island now, right?!

76
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,260
Oh, I wasn't able to get
a hold of you, you see...

77
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,630
Whatever! Just get to work now!

78
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,900
The culprits have split up!

79
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,790
Straw Hat Luffy,
Captain Kid, Trafalgar Law...

80
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,960
Which do we start with?

81
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,940
Oh, you don't say? In that case...

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,790
Bastard...

83
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,740
If you ain't Bartholomew Kuma,
then who are you?!

84
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,840
You look exactly like
the Warlord of the Sea...

85
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,150
What the hell's goin' on here?!

86
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,660
"An Even Stronger Enemy Appears!
The Battle Axe-Carrying Sentomaru"

87
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,300
You're in the way!

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,910
Get the hell outta here, Trafalgar!

89
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,820
I'm taking this guy down!

90
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,830
You're the one who's in the way, Eustass-ya!

91
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,180
Room!

92
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,200
You're a Warlord of the Sea,
yet all you can do is shoot beams?!

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,450
There they are! Trafalgar Law,
captain of the Heart Pirates

94
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,210
and Eustass Captain Kid,
captain of the Kid Pirates!

95
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,610
Don't let them escape!

96
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,810
Damn! Now there's a whole load of marines!

97
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,000
This is no time for us to get stuck here!

98
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,310
Bepo!

99
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,240
We're bustin' straight through! Let's do it!

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,730
Hold on, Jean Bart!

101
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,790
You're the new guy! Don't give me orders!

102
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,340
Take this!

103
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,440
That bastard took all the fun!

104
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,030
Repel!

105
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,890
That's Bartholomew Kuma,
one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea?

106
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,520
Damn! There's not even time to strike back!

107
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
Hey, Zoro!

108
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,430
Th-Three-Sword Style...

109
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,890
--Zoro!
--That idiot!

110
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,280
Hoofprint...

111
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,440
...Blizzard Rose!

112
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,520
Chopper!

113
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,160
Strong Hammer!

114
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,630
Franky Boxing!

115
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,640
Spider Net!

116
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,310
His hand-to-hand combat
abilities are insane, too!

117
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,840
All right! Get ready, now!

118
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,620
Here I come!

119
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,460
Swallow Bon en Avant!

120
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,250
H-Huh?

121
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,090
I'm stuck!

122
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,120
W-Wait! That's dangerous!

123
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,720
Are you trying to kill me?!

124
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,970
Oh, I'm already dead, though...

125
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,690
But this is no time to be saying that!

126
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,970
Special Attack: Atlas Comet!

127
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,560
Now's our chance! Run!

128
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,350
Th-Th-That was scary! Th-Thank you!

129
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,250
H-Huh? He's acting strange!

130
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,910
What?! Now explosives work on him?!

131
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,560
One went in his mouth!

132
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,990
Something shorted out inside his body!

133
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,720
His body's hard, but he still bleeds.

134
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,940
He's just like me, a regular living person

135
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,570
whose body has been modified with weapons!

136
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,740
Nami-san! Look out! He's spotted you!

137
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Oh no!

138
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,910
Ochenta Fleurs!

139
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,630
Cuatro Mano

140
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,200
Shock!

141
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,970
Yes! The beam went off inside his mouth!

142
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,830
He blew himself up!

143
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,840
Sorry to interrupt your little break, mister,

144
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,430
but there's a lightning advisory
right where you're standing!

145
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,730
From the dark clouds to the Climate Baton!

146
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,850
Thunder Lance Tempo!

147
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,070
That had quite an effect! Spectacular!

148
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,340
That didn't affect him at all!
He's still in tip-top shape!

149
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,710
But what is he aiming at?!

150
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,440
Is he acting out of desperation?!

151
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,690
The freak's starting to go berserk!

152
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,540
Give in to despair and the fight's all over!

153
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,210
Hey! Knock him this way!

154
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,370
I'll teach you to be stubborn!

155
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,890
Diable Jambe!

156
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,540
Flambé Shot!

157
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,300
Alright! He's finally starting to fall apart!

158
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,010
Demon Aura Kyutôryu...!

159
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,300
Asura!

160
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,360
Wh-What is that?!

161
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,410
Zoro multiplied!

162
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,990
Nine Lightening Slashes!

163
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,000
Gear Third!

164
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,540
Here goes!

165
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,880
Go, Luffy!

166
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,100
Just one last push!

167
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,550
Gum-Gum...

168
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,350
Crush him, Luffy!

169
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,770
...Giant Rifle!

170
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm shrinking!

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,130
That stopped the bastard, right?

172
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,520
Yeah, it had to have...

173
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,220
It's creepy...
It looks like it could still start moving...

174
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,110
If it does, we're done for...

175
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm so worn out I can't move...

176
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,780
Maybe we should've run away
instead of fighting it...

177
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,780
No, it's best to defeat
whoever we can ahead of time.

178
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,450
We are being chased, after all.

179
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,910
Still, after all is said and done,
what was this guy?!

180
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,850
Given that he's a cyborg,
he must've originally been a person

181
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,260
who looked just like Bartholomew Kuma.

182
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,990
The most natural possibility
is that he was a twin brother

183
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,770
or a super look-alike who was modified.

184
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,520
There's definitely no way to
create a live person from scratch.

185
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,570
PX-4...?

186
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,010
Let's rest a little...

187
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,070
I didn't expect it to turn into
such an all-out fight so suddenly...

188
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,630
I'd love to rest,
but we really should hide first...

189
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,960
If we get spotted again now,
we'll all be caught in one fell swoop!

190
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,260
That's true...

191
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,020
But... wait just a tiny bit longer...

192
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,770
You guys got some nerve!

193
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,470
What?! Another enemy?!
Where's that voice coming from?!

194
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,430
Above! Above!

195
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,990
Hoisa!

196
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,980
Who are you?!

197
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,620
Hey, now! You're a real disgrace, PX-4!

198
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:04,240
It costs as much as an entire warship
to build one Pacifista like you!

199
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,210
Geez, now what am I supposed to
tell that lousy punk in my report?!

200
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,150
"Captain of Navy Headquarters Science Unit"

201
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,800
"Sentomaru"

202
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,720
The Warlord of the Sea is still here!

203
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,950
I-Is that the real one?!

204
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:35,620
Real or not, we don't got enough
strength left to fight that thing!

205
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,020
Did you just say "Pacifista"?!

206
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,350
Pacifista? That's like a pacifist, right?

207
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,750
Is that the name of the guy we just beat?

208
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,870
Who the hell are you, Battle Axe?!

209
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,890
How dare you call people
by their weapons' names...

210
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,200
It's no use asking me questions!

211
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,960
I ain't gonna tell you anything!

212
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,980
I got the toughest defense in the world!

213
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,550
As such, my mouth is sealed just as tight!

214
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,550
You can at least tell us your name!

215
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,100
I have no reason to answer anything!

216
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,750
I already told you!

217
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,270
I'm Sentomaru, the most
tight-lipped guy in the world!

218
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,240
Oh, okay. So you're Sentomaru?

219
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,420
Just so you know, I
voluntarily told you that.

220
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,030
I wasn't answering your question.

221
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,700
Let's begin, PX-1!

222
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,150
He shoots beams from his palms too! Not paws!

223
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,270
I don't wanna think about it,
but that means this is a third one!

224
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,400
What's going on?!

225
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,660
Our safety is more important
than that mystery right now!

226
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,800
O-One more fight,
and we will be critically injured...

227
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,030
...before we even run into the admiral!

228
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,440
Yeah...

229
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,500
Let's get away from here!

230
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,420
But not all together!
We'll split up in groups!

231
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,220
Running sounds good to us!

232
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,120
The three of us should split up!

233
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,690
Alright! You gonna be okay?!

234
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,640
Shut up!

235
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,300
I'll protect you, Nami-swan!

236
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,740
Even if it costs me my life!

237
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,070
Okay, thanks! Now let's get going!

238
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,100
Mellorine!

239
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,200
If you're ready to give up your life,

240
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,160
then you can act as a decoy for all of us!

241
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,910
Offer's for ladies only, you damn bastard!

242
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,530
You can protect your own
damn self, Panty-Man!

243
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,270
Zoro-kun! Do everything you can
to protect me, okay?! Please?!

244
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,130
Hold on, Usopp! I'm hurt enough as it is...!

245
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,030
Fear not! I shall cover you!

246
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,930
I would imagine you're still quite damaged!

247
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,490
I was witness to the entire
incident on Thriller Bark

248
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,270
when you stepped in for him!

249
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,140
Oh...

250
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,600
Thanks!

251
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,010
Let's run there!

252
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,750
Yes!

253
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,570
I'm so scared of beams now!

254
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,290
Guys! Meet on the Sunny in three days!

255
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,870
They're splitting up! After them, PX-1!

256
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,040
Don't let 'em leave Grove #12!
Things'll get ugly if they do!

257
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,240
Special Attack: Super Smoke Star!

258
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,550
Now's our chance!

259
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,170
You certainly are dependable!

260
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,130
Crap! The bridge!

261
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,230
Here he comes!

262
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,710
No! Why's he coming after us?!

263
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,400
Whoa, hey, you! Stop it!

264
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,700
Quit pushing!

265
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,650
He went that way! You guys alright?!

266
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,350
This is no time to be
worried about other people!

267
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,450
Not that pirates mean anything to me, though!

268
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,660
Gum-Gum...

269
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,070
...Gatling!

270
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,170
Hoisa!

271
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,780
Wh-What the...?!

272
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,540
What did he just do?!

273
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,540
Your attack power is quite nice,

274
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,550
but I have the greatest defense in the world!

275
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,630
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

276
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,480
Luffy!

277
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,100
What the...?! This guy is strong, too!

278
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,220
Just so you know, I don't have powers.

279
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,550
Oww...

280
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,990
There's something weird about his moves!

281
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,930
What's the big idea?!

282
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,780
And you call yourself a friend, you brute?!

283
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,860
Get back!

284
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,030
Zoro!

285
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,140
Wh-What?! Who are you?!

286
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,120
Get away! Get away from Zoro, you dumbass!

287
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,900
Z-Z-Zoro-san!

288
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,510
Zoro-san's been hit by a beam!

289
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,570
Hey, Zoro! Hang in there!

290
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,580
Geez, took you long enough!

291
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,690
About time you got here, Uncle Kizaru!

292
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,190
Kizaru?!

293
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,060
Be careful! That man is a navy admiral!

294
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,240
Admiral?!

295
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,410
It's too late for you now...

296
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,570
A 120 million bounty...

297
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,960
Pirate Hunter Zoro...

298
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,260
I'd heard that you're quite the swordsman,

299
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,830
but a one-hit knockout?

300
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,530
Your exhaustion must have really built up...

301
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,940
D-Damn...

302
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,470
The admiral...?

303
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,940
Now you can have a nice, long rest...

304
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,450
Zoro!

305
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,870
We've got a Warlord of the Sea,
a weirdo with a battle axe,

306
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,220
and now a navy admiral?!

307
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,070
If we let you guys escape,

308
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,540
we'll end up losing face.

309
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,960
As we are now, we can't beat these guys!

310
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,900
Everyone focus on escaping!

311
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,580
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,190
"Admiral Kizaru's Fierce Assault
The Straw Hats Face Certain Death!"

313
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,220
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
