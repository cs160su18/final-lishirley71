00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,860

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210

Freedom is our only rule

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,900
It's not our way to worry

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830
It’s important not to wake up

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,020
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,610
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,070
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,870
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,960
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,880
while Zoro, Usopp and Brook get
captured by Hordy at the Ryugu Palace.

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,010
She broke... She broke my heart!

82
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,470
Oh yeah.

83
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,680
What's wrong?

84
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,560
I got an idea!

85
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,020
What don't I just destroy
everything altogether?!

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,780
Boy, he gave me a lot of trouble...

87
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,900
Take care of Hachi, Camie!

88
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,070
Y-Yes.

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,160
Go, Megalo!

90
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,420
So that was the true power of the drug!

91
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:56,690
"A Surprising Confession! The Truth
Behind the Assassination of Otohime!"

92
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,530
We are almost at the plaza! Hurry up, Megalo!

93
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,690
Father-sama...

94
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,030
Hey! I'm here-jamon!

95
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,330
Boss Jimbei-sama! Megalo!

96
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,120
Hey! I'm here-jamon!

97
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,460
I'm so happy to see you!

98
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,960
Father-sama!

99
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,010
I'm coming!

100
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,510
No, wait!

101
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,640
Father-sama!

102
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,480
Please stop!

103
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,270
Princess Shirahoshi!

104
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,030
If you don't wanna see the
Princess get hurt, freeze!

105
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,320
L-Let me go!

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,450
Alright, let's take her!

107
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,080
CONCHCORDE PLAZA

108
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,670
No way!

109
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,720
We have quite an audience.

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,310
Damn!

111
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,020
What a view!

112
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,560
Prince Mamboshi!

113
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,400
Prince Ryuboshi!

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,320
Prince Fukaboshi-sama!

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,450
How did the pirates manage that?!

116
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,780
The Princes were winning by far!

117
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,410
Suddenly, the tables
have turned against them!

118
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,580
Oh, I wanna fight some more-zugon!

119
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,330
Much! Don't get so heated up! Or I'm gonna
become a piece of dried squid-ch!

120
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,960
Soldiers of the army. The ministers.

121
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,260
And the royal family. There is no one
left in this country, who can fight us now!

122
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,970
What unbelievable power!

123
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,350
I'm sorry, Father!

124
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,150
You don't have to be!
Those powers are fake-jamon!

125
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,820
That doesn't really matter if it
enables them to take over the country!

126
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,320
Captain Hordy, let's put them to death!

127
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,740
--Burn them alive!
--No, impale them!

128
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,120
I wish a terrible death on those who lack
pride and look to coexist with the humans!

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,950
Let's show the audience!

130
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,540
Let's just kill them!

131
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,170
Kill them! Kill them!

132
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,090
Kill them! Kill them!

133
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,180
Kill them! Kill them!

134
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,890
Kill them!

135
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,260
Silence.

136
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,270
I haven't heard from Decken's crew yet,
with regards to Shirahoshi's death.

137
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,570
There is no point in doing
this if we can't lure her here!

138
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,820
Don't do anything to our sister!
She won't fight!

139
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,040
She wouldn't harm you in any way!

140
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,710
You think that I don't know anything?

141
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:11,720
She's the Mermaid with that troublesome
power so I want to be rid of her the most.

142
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,970
Hordy!

143
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,800
Captain Hordy!

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,850
We got them!

145
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,150
Princess Shirahoshi and
Jimbei got caught in a trap!

146
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,360
Shirahoshi!

147
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,400
Father-sama! Brothers-sama!

148
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,120
How lucky I am!

149
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,410
We caught the two that I
concerned about most, all at once.

150
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,920
This is too good to be true!

151
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,670
I-I am very sorry!

152
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,590
You wouldn't have to go through
this if I hadn't been fooled...

153
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,680
What's done is done so never mind.

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,470
So you're here as I thought, Jimbei.

155
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,480
I liked you back when you were a wild man.

156
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,110
What happened to you, Hordy?
You look so different from before.

157
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,820
It's Boss Jimbei!

158
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,240
I thought he left the island
after he quit the Warlords!

159
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,120
I heard that Princess Shirahoshi had
been kidnapped by Straw Hat Luffy.

160
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,830
Did Boss Jimbei rescue her?

161
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,340
Now, everyone that I wanted to see is here.

162
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,840
It was easier than I thought.

163
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,640
My only concern now is
what the Straw Hats will do.

164
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,310
But I assume they're desperately looking
for a way in to the Ryugu Palace now.

165
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,480
Even if they make it here after
they find their friends dead,

166
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,070
we're totally ready to ambush them!

167
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,940
There are 30,000 human slaves we've
caught in the sea over the past month.

168
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,580
And 70,000 Fish-Men who know how to use arms.

169
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,520
Wh-What the...

170
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:25,030
They moved here from the
closed Fish-Man District.

171
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,580
Behold...

172
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,710
...100,000 outlaws altogether!

173
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,950
There are a few female and child slaves
who can't fight, outside the plaza.

174
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,210
We will take care of them later.

175
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,250
But we'll soon have more human slaves!

176
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,090
So, 100,000 of you islanders!

177
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,390
You fools are a dishonor to our
race so vacate your houses!

178
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,230
You can either drop dead or run.
Think about what you want!

179
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:40,360
Horsing around in public...
You kids have no class at all!

180
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,490
Don't push your luck!

181
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,280
Hordy Jones.

182
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,370
I haven't seen you for a
long time. What do you want?

183
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,250
I just wanted to say one thing to you
since you're at the height of your glory!

184
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,090
Madam Sharley?!

185
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:07,220
According to my prevision, a man
will destroy the Fish-Man Island.

186
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,220
I may be the one.

187
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,640
Was it me that you saw?

188
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,900
No.

189
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,190
The man who will destroy the island is...

190
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,030
...Straw Hat Luffy!

191
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,950
What?!

192
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:35,790
I can't tell what the Straw Hat
boy will do specifically.

193
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,670
What is your point?

194
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,960
My point is that it's not you!

195
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,380
That's all I can say.

196
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,800
The one who determines the
fate of the Fish-Man Island is...

197
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,220
...not you, Hordy.

198
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,890
Oh, I see! Madam's previsions are accurate!

199
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:01,730
That means Hordy will never
reign over the island!

200
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,460
Madam Sharley!

201
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,660
--Madam!
--How could he do this?!

202
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,950
That's nonsense!

203
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,410
What do you mean by that, Sharley?
What do you have against me?!

204
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,210
I'm not like your brother.

205
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,590
Well, when I was a kid,
everybody in the Fish-Man District

206
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,090
may have looked
up to your brother Arlong.

207
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,220
But then we seized power.

208
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:23,940
In fact, the name "Arlong Pirates" is
nothing but a symbol to unite us now.

209
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,980
We don't even need the
name "Arlong" anymore!

210
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:35,240
The only man who can break the whole country
to its foundation and rebuild it, is...

211
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,370
...me! Because I have enough power to do so!

212
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,000
Look how powerful I am!

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,960
This is the power that I'm talking about!

214
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,930
I started this whole thing 10 years ago.

215
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,260
Let me tell you something.

216
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:05,150
Concerning the late Queen of the Ryugu
Kingdom, who you fools still love!

217
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,700
Otohime was killed by...

218
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,240
...me!

219
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,710
What?!

220
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,300
No...

221
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,970
What about the human then?

222
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,470
How could you not notice it, idiots?!

223
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,560
The day before that fateful
day 10 years ago...

224
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,690
I don't know who you are but...

225
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,570
...I would do anything if I
can make some big money.

226
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,990
Is this real money?!

227
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,910
That's just a half of it. You can have
the rest after you finish the job.

228
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,830
Alright, I'll do it!

229
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,960
Just this is enough to drink
all day for quite some time.

230
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,970
And what do you want me to do?

231
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,640
It's so easy. Even a child can do it.

232
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,390
However, don't let anyone notice.

233
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,690
And on that day...

234
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,830
Get away! Fire!

235
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,700
--Put out the fire!
--Run!

236
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,330
--Protect the royal family!
--Put out the fire now!

237
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,260
Otohime-sama has been shot!

238
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,560
Hey, give me the rest of that money now!

239
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,060
I set fire to those
signatures like you told me to!

240
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,650
I wanna make a run for it
already so give me the money!

241
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,410
What's going on here?

242
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,160
You stupid human.

243
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,330
Shit! Dammit!

244
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,220
It was a human...

245
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,890
...who killed our queen!

246
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,980
Queen Otohime was killed by a human!!

247
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,610
Everybody got fooled completely!

248
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,030
Damn! It was him!

249
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,620
He killed Queen Otohime!

250
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,660
Hordy, you bastard!

251
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,830
Father!

252
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,090
Father!

253
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,300
Hordy, stop!

254
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,920
Father!

255
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,430
She was annoying.
Don't you think so, Shirahoshi?

256
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,770
She begged everyone not to
seek revenge against humans

257
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,650
but to become friends with them instead.

258
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,400
She was bugging me because she
almost accomplished her goal.

259
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,570
I knew I wouldn't be satisfied
with just killing her.

260
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,870
To me, your mother was...

261
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,460
...someone who deserved death!

262
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,830
Don't say such a thing to the Princess!

263
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,250
How dare you?!

264
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:02,090
And then I came up with an idea
to make the best of her death.

265
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,680
Which would allow me to stoke
the hatred towards humans,

266
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,190
that citizens of the
Fish-Man Island once had

267
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,730
and destroy the islanders' stupid
dream along with Otohime - all at once!

268
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,320
I'd point the finger at a
human for killing Otohime.

269
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,040
If I blamed it on a human, I knew that the
islanders will get pissed off at humans again.

270
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:42,260
And it turned out that you all got
fooled by my trick exactly as I wanted!

271
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,930
She was worth killing! Right, Shirahoshi?

272
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,440
Your mother was not murdered by a human!

273
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,860
I, her kinsman, did it!

274
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,990
I, standing in front of you now, killed her!

275
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,880
I already knew it.

276
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,090
Shirahoshi!

277
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,180
What?

278
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,990
A long time ago, everyone on the
Fish-Man Island came together

279
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,990
and built a mysterious
giant ship called Noah.

280
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,830
The reason remains a mystery.

281
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,080
It's just a leftover from the past now.

282
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,330
Let me touch it with my right hand.

283
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,920
Captain Decken, what are you up to?

284
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,850
Wh-What is it? What's going on?!

285
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:23,400
The pain of heartbreak will never go away.

286
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,450
It's moving!

287
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,500
--Wh-What's going on?!
--Run!

288
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,210
I'm throwing the Noah...

289
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,250
...at Shirahoshi!

290
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,010
What?!

291
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,930
The ship is half the size
of the Fish-Man Island!

292
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,100
That means if it hits the island,
not just Shirahoshi

293
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,020
but the whole island will be shattered!

294
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,940
She can't run or hide from me anymore!

295
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,230
Shirahoshi has no choice but to
stay with me in my heart forever!

296
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,860
Burn in hell with the island!
Goodbye my sweet Shirahoshi!

297
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,780
Goodbye Fish-Man Island!

298
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,090
Shirahoshi continues to fulfill her
promise to her mother, Otohime.

299
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,010
Hordy ridicules her and
commences Neptune's execution.

300
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,060
The despairing citizens call out
the name of their last hope.

301
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,230
And their voice resounds
throughout Fish-Man Island!

302
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

303
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,730
"Shirahoshi's Tears!
Luffy Finally Shows Up!"

304
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
