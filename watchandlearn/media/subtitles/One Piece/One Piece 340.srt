2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,270
As night falls upon the
forest around these parts,

48
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,730
it becomes so perilous it hardly
seems like it belongs to this world.

49
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,440
If you please, feel free to take
my carriage to the mansion.

50
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,610
There's a mansion?

51
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,620
Indeed, there is. You're welcome
to visit Dr. Hogback's mansion.

52
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,080
What?!

53
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,580
What? What is it?

54
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,580
What's the big deal, Chopper?

55
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,790
Hogback...

56
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,460
Huh...?

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,940
"The Man Called a Genius!
Hogback Makes His Appearance!"

58
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,850
Hey... The fog kept me from
getting a good look at the horses,

59
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,020
but didn't they seem a bit strange?

60
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,870
Uh, you must be imagining things!

61
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,070
Really...? I hope that's all it is.

62
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,110
Anyway, you're a lifesaver!
Thanks for saving our hides!

63
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,250
It was nothing! Please, have a drink.

64
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,670
This forest is filled with unusual animals,

65
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,880
making it dangerous to simply walk around.

66
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,590
Yeah, I was surprised! I thought
Cerberus was an imaginary animal.

67
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,930
That terrifying beast must
be a mutant or something!

68
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,730
I was afraid we were gonna be stuck
in that tree when you found us.

69
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,480
The mansion is the best place
to wait for your friends.

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,570
It stands out and it's safe.

71
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,520
Plus...

72
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,240
...I'll get to meet Dr. Hogback!

73
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,820
Is he all that famous?

74
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,780
There isn't a single doctor
who doesn't know his name!

75
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,370
He's a famous surgeon.

76
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,670
With his miraculous operations, he's saved
as many people as there are stars!

77
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,500
He has obtained status, honor,
and everything you could get as a doctor!

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,960
He's earned the respect of
doctors around the world!

79
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,050
But then he suddenly vanished one day.

80
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,230
Some say he went missing,
while others say he was abducted.

81
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,190
It threw the medical world
into an uproar for a while,

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,110
but in the end, no one could find any leads.

83
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,490
Now he's on the verge of becoming a legend.

84
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,070
You meant that Dr. Hogback, right?

85
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,570
Indeed! The doctor is
still conducting research

86
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,160
that goes beyond the
boundary of human knowledge.

87
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,370
Would it be okay if I
asked for his autograph?

88
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,130
If that's all you want,
I'm sure that would be fine.

89
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,300
No way!

90
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,800
This forest... even has lions!

91
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,270
No!

92
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,730
What's your problem?! Don't freak me out!

93
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,860
What was it?!

94
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,180
J-Just now, I saw a l-lion outside!

95
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,050
I-It looked like this.

96
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,160
I don't buy that!

97
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,910
Then take a look for yourself!

98
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,690
Go on!

99
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,340
Prey... Fresh prey...

100
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,760
Prey! Fresh prey!

101
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,220
Weird stuff's out there!
Super weird stuff's out there!

102
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,410
Stop right here! Stop the
carriage, Hildon-san!

103
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,370
Why are you so worked up?
Are you having hallucinations?

104
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,700
That wasn't a hallucination!
I'm sure they were out there!

105
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,750
This forest is way too messed up!

106
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,170
I suppose. This forest is a little strange.

107
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,720
The combination of thick fog and fear
can induce hallucinations in some.

108
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,090
Huh? That was a hallucination?

109
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,740
What a relief!

110
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,390
Really, now? A hallucination?

111
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,100
Nah, it was too vivid for that!

112
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,710
Gulp, gulp, gulp!

113
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,360
Hildon-san! Sorry, but could
you take us back to the shore?

114
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,610
Even if it's dangerous, we'll manage somehow.

115
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,820
What?!

116
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,870
But then I won't get to meet Dr. Hogback!

117
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,910
I wanna meet him!

118
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,580
Yeah, yeah, I get how you feel!

119
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,710
But this is when we've gotta listen to
our special Something's Fishy Sensors!

120
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,960
Are you willing to die to meet that doctor?

121
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
Or will you skip meeting him
so we can leave this island alive?

122
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,100
Which will it be?!

123
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,470
Of course I don't want to die! Or get scared!

124
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,720
Is that right? I shall
go inform the coachmen.

125
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,180
Everyone, please wait here.

126
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,440
Stop the carriage!

127
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,030
I'm sorry, Chopper! I know
you're passing up a huge chance.

128
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:26,170
It can't be helped! I'm still green,
since I can't act on my own like Luffy.

129
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,130
"10 Minutes Later..."

130
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,840
"Shhh..."

131
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,300
How long is he going to keep us waiting?

132
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,140
He still isn't back yet...

133
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,220
That's strange. We're just
going back the way we...

134
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,480
What?! No one's there!

135
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,110
Even the horses are gone!

136
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,030
They abandoned us in a graveyard!

137
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,880
They what?! Why?!

138
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,950
Eh?! They abandoned us?!

139
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,660
Sure they aren't going potty?

140
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Hildon! Hey!

141
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,870
Where'd you go?!

142
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,940
Of all the places, why'd they
have to choose a graveyard?

143
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,210
Stop it! Jeez, I'm so scared!

144
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,490
You don't have to remind me where we are!

145
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,530
What's going to happen to us now?

146
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,370
Chopper...

147
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,580
What?!

148
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,750
Beep! Beep!

149
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,350
N-N-No way...

150
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,070
Z-Zombies!

151
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,740
No!!

152
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,380
No!

153
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,180
No! That hurts! It hurts!

154
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,890
Usopp!

155
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,640
Please help me!

156
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,530
Usopp!

157
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,530
No!!

158
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,270
The carriage is gonna fall over!
They're insanely strong!

159
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,090
I've been bit!

160
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,430
Damn it! He bit me!

161
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,350
--Now I'm gonna turn into a zombie!
--Usopp!

162
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,980
I'm on my way!

163
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,860
No, don't bite me! Stop that!

164
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,820
Please save me!

165
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,160
Let go of Usopp!

166
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,040
You bastards!

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,300
I'm sorry!

168
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,760
Here, you dropped this.

169
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,680
Oh, thanks.

170
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,060
Hey, save me! They're about to bite me!

171
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,640
Nami!

172
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,180
Crap! Let go of me! Stay back!

173
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,890
Zombies are weak against...

174
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Special Attack! Flame Star!

175
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,280
--Fire!
--That's rottin' bad!

176
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,240
That worked better than I could have hoped!

177
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,130
That was dangerous, you pyro punk!

178
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,080
What if I actually caught on fire,
you stupid jerk?!

179
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,200
Rotten scum!

180
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,790
That ticked off the zombies.

181
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,830
You'd better hurry, Nami!

182
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,330
This is our chance to escape!

183
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,540
R-Right!

184
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,880
At this point, the mansion's the
closest place to run to for safety.

185
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,970
Yeah, let's go there.

186
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,380
That was scary!

187
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,300
We'll be okay! They can't catch up

188
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,640
if we run like mad for the mansion
once we're outta the graveyard!

189
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,980
Zombies can only walk at a
snail's pace and groan at you.

190
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,560
"At a snail's pace"?

191
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,460
"At a snail's pace"? "At a snail's pace"?

192
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,150
"At a snail's pace"?!

193
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,420
Wait for us!

194
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:04,940
They're fast!

195
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,450
No! No! No--er, huh? Huh?

196
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,920
Just a sec... Time out!

197
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,340
Zero stamina!

198
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,090
Hurry, Usopp!

199
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,340
Y-Yeah!

200
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,700
The waves are carrying the ship away!

201
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,860
What's keeping you, Gah?!

202
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,120
Don't call me "Gah," punk!

203
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,280
The rudder won't budge!

204
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,750
If we used the paddle,
we could fight the waves, but...

205
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,660
I was planning on going to the island anyway.

206
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,750
Why don't we go with the flow?

207
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,840
Jerk! You've totally forgotten
about Nami-san, haven't you?

208
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,340
What's that?

209
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
A spider web on the water?

210
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,560
At this rate, we're going to
ram right into the spider web.

211
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,480
Hey, we need the paddle! Release the paddle!

212
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,650
Don't. It's too late for that.

213
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,300
Damn it! It didn't harm the ship,
but now we're stuck here!

214
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,000
And why is this spider
web so freakishly big?!

215
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,230
They... aren't chasing us anymore, are they?

216
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,600
What's with this island?! It's oozing
with stuff that shouldn't exist!

217
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,390
Guys, if I turn into a zombie,
finish me off in a single blow!

218
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,560
Where'd you come up with that?

219
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,650
It was in the Illustrated Zombie Guide
I read in Sunny's library!

220
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,410
For a scaredy-cat, you read
way too many of those books.

221
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,080
Well, we're here. Right now,
I just want a glass of water!

222
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,830
I get to meet him after all. I can't wait!

223
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,990
I don't think anyone in his right mind
would live on this island.

224
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,340
I'd bet on it!

225
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,070
Excuse me! Is this Dr. Hogback's mansion?

226
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,100
We're traveling pira--sailors!

227
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,560
We got lost and could use some help!

228
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,510
Please let us stay here!

229
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,110
Is anyone here?

230
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,400
What's with this mansion?
A tunnel runs through the center of it!

231
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,910
I can see a courtyard on the other side.

232
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,830
Excuse me!

233
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,560
Maybe no one's home.

234
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,130
That would stink! We'll have to
face zombies if we turn back.

235
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,800
Look! A light in the back turned on.

236
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,720
It's not just a light, it's
a spotlight for this well.

237
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
"Evil Be Gone"

238
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,890
"Evil Be Gone"

239
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,890
Wh-What now?!

240
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,530
Welcome!

241
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,030
One, two, three!

242
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,700
What?! What gives?!

243
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,620
Four, five!

244
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,700
That woman's throwing plates!

245
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,120
Six, seven!

246
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,620
Doesn't it seem like she's goin' after me?!

247
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,960
Yes, I am! I cannot invite
you into the mansion.

248
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,940
Those two may step inside.

249
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,970
Huh? Why?

250
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,890
You may get lost!

251
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,970
Eight, nine!

252
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,470
Why me?!

253
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,220
That's enough! Hold your hand!

254
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,390
What was that?!

255
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,320
I can't take any more scary stuff!

256
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,150
Someone's coming out.

257
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,740
I think we can make this
one exception, Cindry-chan.

258
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,320
I'm sorry if she startled you guys.

259
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,210
A long time ago, this woman was
engaged to her wealthy master.

260
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,830
To test his love, she broke
all of his prized plates.

261
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,420
He tossed her out, and her
tragic past has made her

262
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,960
develop an aversion to plates.

263
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,210
She's my servant, Cindry-chan!

264
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,170
Okay, I really don't care.

265
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:43,350
And I've failed to introduce myself.
I am the world-renowned Dr. Hogback!

266
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,180
Also known as a genius!

267
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,230
--Ten!
--Usopp!

268
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,480
Hey, hey, hey! Cindry-chan,
I said you could stop!

269
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,530
It makes me look bad
when you don't listen to me.

270
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,860
Crap!

271
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,500
I wish plates would disappear
from the face of the earth!

272
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,710
I understand! I understand completely!

273
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,880
But I was in the middle of a conversation!

274
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,670
Chopper, is he the guy
you were talking about?

275
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,510
D-Dr. Hogback in the flesh!

276
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
He doesn't seem too bright.

277
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,990
Watch it, Nami!

278
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,140
You may talk inside.
Today, I will make an exception.

279
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,850
All three of you may enter.

280
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,400
Come in!

281
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,020
R-Right, right! Come inside my mansion.

282
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,460
I don't get why I wasn't welcome,
but should we take them up on the offer?

283
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,450
Sure. Beats the zombies outside.

284
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,410
I'm still...

285
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,980
I'm still outside...

286
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,380
It's a pleasure to welcome you to my mansion.
But my, you sure are grungy!

287
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,180
What brings you here?

288
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,100
A whole bunch of things, but for starters--

289
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,020
I'll explain everything in detail later.

290
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,810
Zombies attacked us in the graveyard,
so we ran here for cover.

291
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,070
Zombies, eh?

292
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,150
There was a whole bunch of stuff
that made us doubt our eyes.

293
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,450
What's the deal with this island?

294
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,530
Since you live here,
you've gotta know something!

295
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,040
I see. So they attacked you, huh?

296
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,460
I'm glad you made it here
in one piece. That's a relief!

297
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,380
To answer your question:

298
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,670
I don't know what they are,
which is why I live here.

299
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,090
So you're conducting research on the zombies?

300
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,550
Indeed, I am!

301
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,800
People are terrified when they hear "zombie."

302
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,720
But what if I rephrase it
to "resurrecting the dead"?

303
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,690
Hasn't that been all mankind's eternal dream?

304
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,780
Everyone has a special someone or two
they'd like to see return from the dead.

305
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,280
But toying with human mortality is
unorthodox medicine that disrespects God!

306
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,580
That's why I slipped away
from the public eye--

307
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,830
so I could continue my
research on this island in secret!

308
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,530
S-So that's the story!

309
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,570
But I'm sure tons of people
around the world

310
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,460
would be thrilled if your
research is a success!

311
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,130
I'll be rooting for you, Dr. Hogback!

312
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,850
You're rather open-minded!
Thank you, Dr. Chopper.

313
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,180
What?!

314
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,770
Sh-Shucks, Doctor! I'm not happy because
you thanked me or anything, you jerk!

315
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,560
May I have your autograph?

316
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,120
Why, certainly!

317
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,240
"To Dr. Chopper..."

318
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,240
To Dr. Chopper...

319
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,160
Could you show me your lab later?

320
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,700
By all means, steer clear of my laboratory!

321
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,880
Hey, Cindry-chan! Put the flan on plates!

322
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,340
Couldn't you at least do that for me?

323
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,610
I wish plates would disappear
from the face of the earth!

324
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,020
Guys, I wash the heck out of the
tablecloth for times just like this,

325
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,060
so feel free to eat away!

326
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,030
Don't mind if we do!

327
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,480
You can still use your spoons!

328
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,070
It's yummy and sweet!

329
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,940
I've drawn you a bath.

330
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,240
You're a filthy lot, so go hop in.

331
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,490
Hey, Pops. He doesn't mean anything to me,

332
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,700
but did a weird skeleton
drop by before we arrived?

333
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,170
A-A skeleton?

334
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,130
Yeah. He's tall with an afro
and he's oddly cheerful.

335
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,310
Of course, the fact that he's a talking,
walking skeleton makes him odd enough.

336
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Do you know anything about him?

337
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,240
N-No, I don't...

338
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,240
Really? Then forget it.

339
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,370
Could it be him? Nah, it couldn't be...

340
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,470
Nami, why do I have to
stand watch while you bathe?

341
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,220
Don't look!

342
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,970
Listen! We're leaving as soon as night falls.

343
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,430
Whoa, how could you say that?!
There are zombies outside!

344
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,310
Listen to yourself! Do you seriously
think the mansion is safe?

345
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,730
Huh? Y-You don't mean...

346
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

347
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,020
"Nami's in a Major Pinch! The Zombie
Mansion and the Invisible Man!"

348
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
