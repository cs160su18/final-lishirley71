00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,500
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,830
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

80
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,030
and have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,660
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,080
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

83
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,020
And while each member of the Straw Hats is
fighting the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

84
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,500
Luffy and Law are heading for the Royal Palace
to take down Doflamingo.

85
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,960
I see no end to this.

86
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm gonna take out all of them!

87
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,760
Stop messing with Straw Hat Luffy!
You dumbshits!

88
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,740
Rah-Rah-Rah-Rampage!

89
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,810
I found a shortcut to
reach the higher levels.

90
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,480
What? Really?!

91
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,880
See? There's a shortcut!

92
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,530
Now, go ahead, Straw Hat.
We'll guard the entrance!

93
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,080
Alright, thanks!

94
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,740
Moocy, let's go!

95
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,740
What?!

96
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,120
Ring, ring, ring...

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,870
--Luffy. It's me.
--Robin!

98
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,710
Viola found the key to Tra-guy-kun's cuffs!

99
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,010
Oh yeah?!

100
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,800
Let's meet up at the Sunflower Field
on the fourth level!

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,390
Stop! He's soaking in the water!

102
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,570
What?! It's a dead end!

103
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,800
Go back! Hurry!

104
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,650
Moocy! Don't panic!

105
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,700
This is just a slanted water well.
There is no such shortcut in here.

106
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,150
You!

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,690
Doflamingo!

108
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:36,380
"A Great Escape!
Luffy's Tide-turning Elephant Gun!"

109
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,040
Doflamingo!

110
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,540
You weaklings are working together...

111
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,090
Looks like you're gonna get those
handcuffs off soon, aren't you, Law?

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,850
Why the hell are you here?!

113
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,350
I came to save you.

114
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,650
How could you fall into such a stupid trap?
That crap about a shortcut!

115
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,170
Straw Hat!

116
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,160
Bullet String!

117
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,250
Moocy!

118
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,500
Give him up! Straw Hat-ya!

119
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,520
Moocy...

120
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,020
You have no sense of crisis...

121
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,770
Stay... with me... Moocy...

122
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,110
So cheesy!

123
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,570
Anyone could kill you guys like this.

124
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,590
There are some idiots who
are saying they'll kill me,

125
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,530
rampaging out there...

126
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,980
It's amazing how you found

127
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,690
people who side with you
under these circumstances.

128
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,730
I've been giving you due respect for

129
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,420
that special quality of yours
since the War of the Best.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,150
But...

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,770
...you're actually this dumb!

132
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,310
Why did you choose him, Law?

133
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,250
You used to be a more promising man.

134
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,980
Even when you were a kid,
you were more ruthless

135
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,770
and more cunning!

136
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,740
Am I right?!

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,990
Who made you... into such a coward?

138
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,200
Shut up!

139
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,310
I'm not willing to become like you!

140
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,380
I've been... saved!

141
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,510
By my brother Corazon, you mean?

142
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,180
If you haven't become a coward,

143
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,300
why do you want to die in vain...

144
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,150
...alongside this dumbshit?

145
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,130
Stop! Don't hurt Straw Hat-san!

146
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,130
Get your hands off of him!

147
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,310
--What the hell is this?!
--What's wrong with his body?!

148
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,850
It's his clone as I thought.

149
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,920
Clone?

150
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
That's a string puppet.

151
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,370
You guys...

152
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,260
--Straw Hat-san!
--Glad that you're safe!

153
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,880
In any case, pull out Straw Hat-san!

154
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,750
Yeah!

155
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,440
Are you okay?! Straw Hat-san?!

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,380
Don't do it!

157
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,440
Doflamingo!

158
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,970
The guy with a hundred-million berry prize...

159
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,050
I found him!

160
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,320
If I can kill him, I'd be invited
to join the Doflamingo Family...

161
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,190
That's...!

162
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,080
D-Damn!

163
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,040
What're you doing, old man?!
Let go of it!

164
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,310
You're gonna kill Kyros...

165
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,940
I'm not gonna let a foreign pirate
do such a thing!

166
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,260
You fool!

167
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,890
You stupid old geezer!
How dare you bother me!

168
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,570
I'm sorry. You saved my life, elderly man.

169
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,990
Thank you!

170
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,930
I-I beg you!

171
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,370
S-Stay still, don't resist and...

172
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,160
...let me capture you!

173
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm sorry but I can't do that!

174
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,330
Stay away!

175
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,390
You people are peaceful in nature
and don't wish to fight...

176
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,150
But Doflamingo forced you to do such a thing!

177
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,270
And I have to take him down for it!

178
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,680
I'm sorry!

179
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,620
You saved me... Thank you!

180
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,670
No, no, no, no...

181
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,580
Now, is that his lower body?!
What's going on with that?!

182
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,340
All in all, we brought down
the big game, didn't we?!

183
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,530
Idiot!
I told you before. That's a fake!

184
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,060
He took the trouble to
send the string puppet...

185
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,140
To tease us?

186
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,530
He said he came to save us.

187
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,700
Oh yeah!
Actually, that Kelly Funk guy from earlier...

188
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,340
That bastard was fooling us!

189
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,620
What a simple-minded fool...
He fell into our trap completely.

190
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,170
We learned that and
when we tried to stop him...

191
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,670
We gotta do something!
Abdullah, can you get up?

192
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,710
What?!

193
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,260
That infamous assassin Kelly got
taken out in a split second...

194
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,270
If it's true,

195
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,250
it's like we were really saved by that jerk!

196
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,920
He's mocking us!

197
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,310
What's going on out there?!
How are Cabbage and the others?!

198
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,240
We're totally falling behind...

199
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,010
I bet everybody else reached the second level
by now!

200
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,210
Damn! I thought we could take a shorter route
to the Sunflower Field!

201
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,360
We gotta go back! Hurry up!

202
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,540
No...

203
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,340
Let's go for it... A shorter route!

204
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,920
What're you...

205
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,180
If there's no shortcut here,
I'll have to make one!

206
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,680
What?!

207
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,750
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF
THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 1

208
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,120
What the...?!

209
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,860
I guess everybody else is heading to
the second level already.

210
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,620
Gotta hurry up.

211
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,810
W-Wait a minute!
What are you up to, Straw Hat-san?!

212
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,200
Straw Hat?

213
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,100
Gum-Gum...

214
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,840
Ah! There's not a single

215
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,690
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF
THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 2

216
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,710
dropout on the first level!

217
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,320
It's impossible!

218
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,890
Our subordinates can't match them-in!

219
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,710
Straw Hat and his group aren't here yet.

220
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,060
Let's take them out one by one.

221
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,190
Sounds like fun!

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,490
What's wrong, Farul?!

223
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,610
What the...

224
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,200
What's going on?!

225
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,870
Something's coming!

226
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,880
Elephant Gun!!

227
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,070
Elephant Gun!!

228
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,740
What's that?!

229
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,790
A fist?

230
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,200
Oh my...!

231
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,030
I see. That's smart!

232
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,090
Only Garp's grandson could do it!

233
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,800
Straw Hat did it, didn't he?

234
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,970
Look out!

235
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,730
Straw Hat!

236
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,190
I like this confusion!

237
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,970
Chin Jao and the others are
heading to the third level!

238
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,010
Stop them!

239
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,770
What was that explosion?!

240
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,220
--Oh no!
--There'll be another one!

241
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,580
They don't even know what it is!
How could they be freaked out by it!

242
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,170
Guys! Don't lose sight of the enemies!

243
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,220
I need to rush!

244
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,560
Alright! Let's go, Tra-guy!

245
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,480
He really made a shortcut!

246
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,340
You're too reckless!

247
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,110
Guys!
Take care of Moocy, okay?!

248
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,880
Yes, sir!

249
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,970
Alright! Let's go!

250
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,860
This big hole...

251
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,330
What the... hell is going on...

252
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,900
What's this?!

253
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,210
Gum-Gum...

254
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,380
...Rocket!

255
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,890
It's Straw Hat!

256
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,520
Alright! I caught up with
them on the second level!

257
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,740
Straw Hat!

258
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,190
Trafalgar Law!

259
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,490
--Let's get going! Straw Hat-ya!
--Yeah!

260
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,520
Wait for me, Mingo!

261
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,150
Oh damn!

262
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,370
Dragon Claw Fist! Dragon...

263
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,700
...Claw!

264
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,790
What a fight!

265
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,470
Oh yeah. This smoke doesn't
slow you down at all!

266
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,640
I guess not.

267
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,830
That's what I'd expect from
No.2 of the Revolutionary Army,

268
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,680
leader of the next generation.

269
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,400
Your attacks are quite sharp.

270
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,590
You don't mean that.

271
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,950
IN FRONT OF THE SMILE FACTORY

272
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,530
Fraland!

273
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,340
Tontattas?!

274
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Listen to me, Fraland!

275
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,460
We have an idea to unlock the door
to the Factory!

276
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,270
What?! Really?!

277
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,020
Yes!
So please keep Señor busy like that!

278
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,590
I got it!

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,030
Count on me!

280
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,180
IN THE TOWN

281
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,950
Look! There are two people with a prize

282
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,140
of a hundred-million!

283
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,230
Shoot!

284
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,360
Oh no! They found us!

285
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,950
You bastards!

286
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,420
What are you gonna do if
you hit Robin-senpai?!

287
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,700
Don't worry!
I'm gonna put up a barrier now!

288
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,560
Barrier it is!

289
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,390
Dammit!
I can't cross my fingers like this!

290
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,060
Shoot them down!

291
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,580
Whoa! Watch out!
You assholes! Don't push your luck!

292
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,990
When it comes to this,

293
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,200
I'm gonna do the same thing
that I did at the Colosseum!

294
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,880
Hey, wait! What is he doing?!

295
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,830
What?! Don't tell me...

296
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,650
he's gonna do it!

297
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,280
Take this, fools!

298
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,390
Humph! What a bunch of cowards!

299
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,380
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF
THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 4

300
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,340
THE SUNFLOWER FIELD

301
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,280
You'll promote me to executive of the Family
if I win the competition?!

302
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,830
Yeah.

303
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,710
You can do it.

304
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,680
He told me to finish you off here.

305
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,550
That's Young Master-sama's order.

306
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,170
I can't go on... like this!

307
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,350
Hey hey, Doffy!

308
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,160
Did you send String-Joker off somewhere?

309
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,940
Yes...

310
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,610
I wanted to deliver something
but I guess he doesn't need it.

311
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,130
Deliver something?

312
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,310
You guys...

313
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,060
Do you remember the day we met Law
for the first time?

314
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,560
He was nuts!

315
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,800
Even his eyes were crazy...

316
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,250
Yeah, yeah!

317
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,620
He looked like me when I was a kid.

318
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:49,580
I sensed he would become my
right-hand man in 10 years or so.

319
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,730
It's a shame that I will have to kill him
with my own hands.

320
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,560
We have an intruder!

321
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,190
Don't touch him!
He has explosives strapped to his body!

322
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,320
Hey! Who the hell is this kid?!
Who lets him in?!

323
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,620
Let me join your pirate group.

324
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,620
I wanna destroy everything that I see!

325
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,130
Towns, houses, people...
I wanna destroy them all!

326
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,770
I...

327
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,130
...grew up in the White Town - Flevance.

328
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,560
It's not so long...

329
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,600
...before I die.

330
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,040
Mingo!

331
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,300
The Executives of the Doflamingo

332
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,610
Family show themselves
before Luffy and the others

333
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,280
and a back-and-forth, full-scale
fierce fight begins!

334
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,350
When it seems their way to
the Royal Palace has been blocked up,

335
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,890
the disorganized group of debtors finally
proves their real worth!

336
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

337
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,530
"A United Front! Luffy's
Breakthrough to the Victory!”

338
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,620
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
