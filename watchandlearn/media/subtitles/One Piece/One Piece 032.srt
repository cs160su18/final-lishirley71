2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,720
"Witch of Cocoyashi Village!
Arlong's Female Leader"

25
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,700
What's this guy saying?

26
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,520
Let go.

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,910
I told you, that's mine!

28
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,310
Say what?! Who decided that?!

29
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,450
I took it myself and put it on my
own plate, so of course it's mine!

30
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,430
Oh. Really? Then you should've said so!

31
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,030
And I was saving that for last, too!

32
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,530
Okay, I'm sorry! You can have this!

33
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,180
You know I can't eat that!
I'm not a dog, you know!

34
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,960
Quiet!

35
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,300
Something's down there...

36
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,770
It's big...

37
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,570
What's that?

38
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,960
A sea monster!

39
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,350
It's a cow! It's huge!

40
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,790
A cow? They don't swim. It's a hippo.

41
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,920
What's something like this
doing in the East Blue?!

42
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,920
This is a Grand Line creature!

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,990
Huh? What's this guy doing?

44
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,440
He's after the food!

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,230
What?!

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,820
Hurry and give it to him!
He'll flip the boat over!

47
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,730
Gum-Gum Pistol!

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,330
Stay away from my food!

49
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,700
You did it! You're incredible,
Big Bro Luffy!

50
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,620
Looks like you made it mad!

51
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,860
Another one, huh?!

52
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,580
You dumbass!

53
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,080
Don't beat up someone
who's hungry for no reason!

54
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,320
He's probably hurt or something
and can't catch his own food.

55
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,510
Right?

56
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,880
What love...

57
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,720
Here, eat up.

58
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,860
No need to hold back.

59
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,530
Die, you damn thing!

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,990
What're you doing?!
What happened to that love?!

61
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,320
The bastard just tried to eat me, too.

62
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,500
Here he comes!
He's gonna sink the boat!

63
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,420
That jerk!

64
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,050
Get back. I'll do it.

65
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,050
Collier Shoot!

66
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,500
Damn hippo...

67
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,360
Alright! Back to food!

68
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,300
That was good exercise.

69
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,850
These guys are crazy...

70
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,490
W-Where am I?

71
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,760
My house.

72
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,560
You awake?

73
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,080
W-Who are you?!

74
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,870
I'm Nojiko. I grow tangerines here.

75
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,880
That's right! You thwacked me!

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,290
Just when I was trying
to save you, too!

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,680
I'm the one who saved you.

78
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,760
Had you done anything to that fishman,

79
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,010
there's no question
you would've been killed.

80
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,520
This is why I hate outsiders!

81
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,620
But you're a kid from Gosa, right?

82
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,970
Surely you know all too well
from firsthand experience

83
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,870
that you'll be killed if
you mess with the fishmen.

84
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,720
I know!

85
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,290
I know, but... they killed my daddy!

86
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,570
They stole everything,
destroyed our town,

87
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,340
and killed tons of people!

88
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,760
They have to pay!
No matter what, they have to pay!

89
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,180
So I went to Arlong Park!

90
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,760
But a girl on his side got in the way!

91
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,560
She... was like a witch!

92
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,530
I hate this! I don't care if I die;
I'm going to avenge my daddy!

93
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,780
Then die.

94
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,610
If you're prepared to die,
then go get your revenge!

95
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,060
But know this much.

96
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,250
Now that me and that witch
at Arlong Park have stopped you,

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,900
you've escaped death twice now!

98
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,210
Leave when you're done with your tea.

99
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,200
Hey! Isn't that being
a little harsh on the kid?!

100
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,470
Kid or not, if someone wants to die,
then just let 'em die!

101
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,620
He doesn't have the guts to live
through hard times anyway!

102
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,840
Say what?!

103
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,360
I know a kid who's staring
fixedly at the distant future

104
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,080
while she endures a life
more painful than death.

105
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,030
That's why I hate people like him
who consider death right off the bat!

106
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,210
What... should I do?

107
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,660
I hate this! I'll endure it!

108
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,440
What should I do?!

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,080
What about your mom?

110
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,800
She's alive...

111
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,340
She's worried about you. Go back to her.

112
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,330
Okay...

113
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,780
You're actually a nice person!
Even though you have tattoos...

114
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Prejudice!

115
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,950
I don't know anything
about you, you know...

116
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,410
Oh, right!

117
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,770
My name is Captain Usopp!

118
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,160
I'm looking for a girl named Nami...

119
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,370
Nami?!

120
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,690
You know her?

121
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,300
What?! Nami's a leader
of the Arlong Pirates?!

122
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,650
Yep. She's infamous in this area.

123
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,810
Even that little boy said
she seemed like a witch.

124
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,640
Even more surprising,
that witch grew up in this very house!

125
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,480
Me and Nami are adopted sisters.

126
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,130
So this is...

127
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,410
...Nami's house?!

128
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,930
Me and Nami are both orphans.

129
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,870
We were brought up in this house.

130
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,660
Our foster parent is dead, too,

131
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,870
but the three of us used to live
happily here in Cocoyashi Village.

132
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,380
Then... Nami betrayed her own
parent and fellow villagers

133
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,050
and joined Arlong's group?!

134
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,350
Yeah, pretty much. A real witch, huh?

135
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,120
Damn it! So that's the deal?!

136
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,670
So she had us fooled the entire time!

137
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,690
She was after treasure
from the very start!

138
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,570
Even after she helped
fight to protect my village

139
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,410
and smiled so happily aboard our ship!

140
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,370
Oh? Happily?

141
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,330
Her?

142
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,500
We came here to
bring her back with us,

143
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,050
but I guess there's no need for--

144
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,520
That reminds me, a friend
of ours was unlucky enough

145
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,510
to be caught by the fishmen...

146
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,010
This is bad...

147
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,600
I wonder how the guy's holding up...

148
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,430
Well? Now do you see?

149
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,950
I was only using you guys
from the very start.

150
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,190
You had some decent skill, and you
were good suckers worth using.

151
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,090
So you had them completely fooled!

152
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,080
This girl's like a cold-blooded witch--

153
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,290
she'll even forget about her
own parent's death for money!

154
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,160
Just chalk it up to bad luck
that you crossed her and give up.

155
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,660
I see.

156
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,790
Though it's not like I ever
trusted her to begin with.

157
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,710
Even if she were a homicidal maniac,
I wouldn't be too surprised.

158
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,450
In that case, could you
get the hell out of here?!

159
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,650
You're an eyesore!

160
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,690
What happened?! Why'd he
suddenly jump into the water?!

161
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,450
Is someone pulling
some kinda lame joke?

162
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,840
No, it's not like he slipped or anything...

163
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,170
Then he ran away!

164
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,010
No, his arms and legs're tied!
He can't swim like that!

165
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,210
It's a suicide!

166
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,050
Leave him be.

167
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,650
Can't believe he'd kill himself...

168
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,200
He was terrifyingly good at giving up!

169
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,020
It's like, damn, value your life more!

170
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,080
T-That idiot!

171
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
He's back up!

172
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,810
Hey! What's going on, Nami?!

173
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,980
What do you think you're doing?!

174
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,200
No, what do you think you're doing?!

175
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,320
You're just a small fry who
can't even watch one guy die...

176
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,160
Quit tryin' to act cool!

177
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,120
Save me sooner next time, you idiot!
I thought I was gonna die!

178
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,050
Screw you!

179
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,270
Mess with me any more
and you will die!

180
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,280
I wonder.

181
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,620
That's a lot of bandages you have.

182
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,730
Didn't have a change of clothes,
so I used these instead.

183
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,700
Hey, Nami.
What should we do with him?

184
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,690
Lock him up! I'll deal with him myself!

185
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,050
Arlong-san! Arlong-san!

186
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,410
What is it, brother?

187
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,880
I'm sorry! That guy had a
long-nosed friend with him,

188
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,430
but he got away!

189
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,250
What the hell, Usopp?!

190
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,320
You wound up getting spotted anyway?!

191
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I think he might've escaped
into Cocoyashi Village...

192
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,140
Cocoyashi Village, huh?

193
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,930
Perfect. I have other
business there, too.

194
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,770
Guess I'll head out for a bit.

195
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,700
Hey! Arlong's coming!

196
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,080
What?! What for?!

197
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,450
We just paid our tribute money to him!

198
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,220
It's probably about the
weapons of mine they found...

199
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,200
Return to your houses, everyone.

200
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,700
Gen-san...

201
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,820
They're here!

202
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,200
So you're the bastard who
was in possession of weapons...

203
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,300
Yes. That's right...

204
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,190
Because I've always
enjoyed looking at weapons.

205
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,780
Are collections not allowed
under your rule, either?

206
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,120
No, I can't have that.

207
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,660
Weapons breed nothing
but evil thoughts and violence.

208
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,740
They're the chief things
that undermine peace.

209
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,690
He's huge! That's Arlong?!

210
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,290
H-He's not human!

211
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,420
Nope. Because he's a fishman.

212
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,300
Yeah...

213
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,360
I control 20 towns and villages.

214
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,610
As their manager,
I can't afford to have rebellions.

215
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,250
I destroyed the great port town
of Gosa as an example

216
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,240
to the other communities!

217
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,060
The blunder of being
unable to pay tribute money

218
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,400
is an act of rebellion against us!

219
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,960
Hey! Tribute money?

220
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,370
Exactly as it sounds.
It's money that we offer to them.

221
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,480
We buy our lives
every month with money.

222
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,330
Adults and kids...

223
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,490
If anyone in a village can't
pay the tribute money...

224
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,660
If there's even just one person...

225
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,240
...the village gets
wiped out just like Gosa.

226
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,330
Then that huge town was destroyed
just because of one person?!

227
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,010
That's how Arlong governs.

228
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,510
They're species-obsessed and don't
give a damn about killing people.

229
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,650
Listen.

230
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,600
You lowly humans simply need to
keep paying up without thinking!

231
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,740
I need enormous funds!

232
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,640
Your tribute money will
eventually become the cornerstone

233
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,480
of the Arlong Empire,
which will rule the East Blue!

234
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,360
A-Arlong Empire?!

235
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,270
They're planning to turn the entire
East Blue into a fishman empire?!

236
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,360
Hurry and escape.
Before Arlong comes back.

237
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,250
Gen-san!

238
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,380
The possession of weapons
is a clear sign of rebellion!

239
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,370
To keep any more rebels
like you from showing up,

240
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,840
I'm going to kill you right now,
as an example to the other humans!

241
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,890
No way! He'll kill someone
just for having a weapon?!

242
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,370
He has no right...

243
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,100
H-H-Hey, you!

244
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,770
You have no right to do this, Arlong!

245
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,060
For these past eight years straight,
we've paid you your tribute money!

246
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,240
Why would we want
to rebel now, of all times?!

247
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,500
Take your hands off Gen-san!

248
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,100
Yeah!

249
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,670
It's not like he used any weapons!

250
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,780
Stop this!

251
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,120
Let Gen-san go!

252
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm saying that the possession of
weapons indicates the will to rebel.

253
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,560
Or what? Shall the entire
village be destroyed?

254
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,180
If just one of you lays a hand on us,
your village will meet its demise.

255
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,770
Either way is fine with me!

256
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,770
Get inside, everyone!

257
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,330
If we cause trouble now, the last
eight years will be for nothing!

258
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,700
If you're going to fight to
the death to defy his rule,

259
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,650
then you should've done so
eight years ago instead!

260
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:30,220
But we all swore to fight
the patient fight! To live!

261
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,080
Gen-san!

262
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,170
But...

263
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,590
What a valuable opinion!
You're a great speaker!

264
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,970
Yes! Being alive is enjoyable!
Even for puny insects like you!

265
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,130
Gen-san!

266
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,530
Not all living things are born equal!

267
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,810
--Damn you!
--Stop!

268
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,220
Don't do anything!

269
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,200
B-But, Gen-san!

270
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,570
If you die, it's all over!

271
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,160
Don't stop fighting the patient fight!

272
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
Even if I die!

273
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,660
That's nice resolve!

274
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,670
Pay close attention, humans!

275
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,180
This is what happens to those who
have even a sliver of evil thoughts!

276
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,820
Exploding Star!

277
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,810
W-What was that?!

278
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,560
Look! Up there!

279
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,710
There's someone on the roof!

280
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,800
Who the hell are you?!

281
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,120
My name is Captain Usopp,
Brave Warrior of the Sea!

282
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,830
Him!

283
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,330
T-The world fears me
and calls me Demon King Usopp,

284
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,220
the man from the Netherworld!

285
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,290
If you run away now, I'll forgive you!

286
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,770
I have 8,000...

287
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,860
Arlong-san! That's him!

288
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,690
The guy who got away earlier!

289
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,420
Eep.

290
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,760
Bring all the tens of
thousands of men you want.

291
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,960
I'll tear apart every last one!

292
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,180
He's not scared, and the
Exploding Star had no effect!

293
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,640
What has a human...

294
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,610
...a mere, lowly human... done to me?!

295
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,260
Arlong-san! Wait!

296
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,080
We'll lose another source
of tribute money, after Gosa!

297
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,900
Human settlements are easy to destroy,
but our goal is to rule them!

298
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,480
If we lose some,
we can just get some more!

299
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,430
We are the supreme species!

300
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,810
Now he's destroying the village!

301
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,690
Is he--

302
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,820
Whoa! I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

303
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,650
H-He's still alive! After 'im!

304
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,650
Crap!

305
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,780
Catch him and kill him!

306
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,290
Hey! Let's get back to Arlong Park!

307
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,890
He's seriously about
to destroy the village!

308
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,740
Yeah!

309
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,400
Do not let him get away!

310
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,770
Who does he take us for?!

311
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,270
We'll be back another day.

312
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,370
Looks like you're spared for now!

313
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,270
I'm sorry... I caused you all trouble...

314
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,790
What are you talking about?
You're not at fault here!

315
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah!

316
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,340
But who was that youngster earlier?

317
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,230
Everyone! It's good to see you again!

318
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,570
--Nami!
--It's Nacchan!
--It's her!

319
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,120
What's going on?

320
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,950
You never walk right through the village...

321
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,030
I heard a loud sound...

322
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,840
Arlong, huh?

323
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,340
Just seven million Berries left to go...

324
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,390
You have as horrible
a reputation as ever.

325
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,150
That's fine. I am a pirate!

326
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,130
But Arlong's a reasonable guy.

327
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,270
Money will fix all this,

328
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,780
so it's just a little more
until our agreement.

329
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,800
No matter what, I'm going
to earn 100 million Berries

330
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,680
and buy this village!

331
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,370
She tells me to run, but I got
nowhere else to go but here...

332
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,310
Plus I promised Luffy I'd bring her back.

333
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,380
What's he up to now?

334
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,650
Things're starting to get messy.

335
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,140
Yahoo! So fast! So fast!

336
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,810
Big Bro Luffy! I see it! Arlong Park!

337
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,600
Go! To Arlong Park!

338
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

339
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

340
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,620
I'll set off by myself,

341
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,600
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

342
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,350
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

343
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,450
Why is it so hot?

344
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:55,450
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

345
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,750
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

346
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

347
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

348
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

349
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,020
Hey! Luffy!
Why're you flying here in a boat?!

350
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,210
'Cause I was in a hurry!

351
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,260
That's not what I meant!
What the hell are you doing?!

352
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,820
I'm here to get Nami back!
Have you still not found her?

353
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,420
About that... it's a long story.

354
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,530
That reminds me, where's Long-nose?

355
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,690
Crap! He's been caught by Arlong!

356
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,090
On the next episode of One Piece!

357
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,540
"Usopp Dead?! When is Luffy
Going to Make Landfall?"

358
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,550
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
