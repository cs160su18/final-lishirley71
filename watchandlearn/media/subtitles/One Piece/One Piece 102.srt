00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:19,020
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,340
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,150
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,920
The burning land is now
enveloped by a mighty swell.

25
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,970
After parting with Ace, Luffy
and company continue to trek

26
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,910
through the vast desert
as they hurry to Yuba.

27
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,910
As for whether they can stop
the beleaguered rebel army...

28
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,540
...the setting sun watches
over them silently.

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,240
"Ruins and Lost Ways!
Vivi, Her Friends, and the Country's Form"

30
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,290
Looks like he's back with us.

31
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,870
Huh?

32
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,810
Are you finally sane again?

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,530
You're such a nuisance.

34
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,850
Huh? Wha? Huh?

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,060
Where are the others?

36
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,110
Dunno.

37
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,030
Huh? You don't know?

38
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm not sure, to be more precise.

39
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,990
Don't be funny.

40
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,880
This is no time to be laughing!

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,780
Yeah.

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,720
So we're lost again?

43
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,390
Whose fault do you think that is?!

44
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,220
Wha? M-My fault?

45
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,900
Get back here, Crocodile!

46
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,230
Huh?

47
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,340
What's he freaking out about?

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm gonna kick your butt!

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,800
Plus he's flying...

50
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,930
Did he eat another weird cactus?

51
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,180
Ugh! Can't he ever not cause trouble?!

52
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,680
Chopper!

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,410
I don't think he can help.

54
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,990
Oh, geez. Alright, Zoro. It's up to you.

55
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,230
Why me?!

56
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,970
Want me to talk more about your debt?

57
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,800
If you don't end up in hell,
I'm gonna kick you down there myself!

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,920
I look forward to it!

59
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,770
Okay! Let's get going!

60
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,140
Eh? Shouldn't we wait for them?

61
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,610
They can just follow our footprints.

62
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,310
With their strength,
they'll catch up in no time.

63
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,380
We can wait somewhere relaxing.

64
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,430
Agreed...

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,330
Will they really be all right?

66
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,990
You idiot! Wake up!

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,510
Urgh!

68
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,620
Stick him with a needle
or something, quick!

69
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,380
O...kay...

70
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,840
Come on, now...

71
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,790
Can't count on anyone!

72
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,500
Crocodile!

73
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,340
I found you!

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,660
What're you talking about?!

75
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,020
I'm gonna...

76
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,950
You dumbass! Don't make me...

77
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,950
...kick your butt!

78
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Gum-Gum...

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,310
...wake you up!

80
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,610
...Submarine!

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,230
Even though this happens
every single time...

82
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,260
...stopping him when
he's gone crazy is a pain!

83
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,430
Urgh!

84
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,330
How did I wind up
following a captain like this?

85
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,790
Oww! Hot!

86
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,560
What am I--?!

87
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,660
What are you doing?!

88
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,250
What's going on?!
What in the world happened?!

89
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,770
Hey! Zoro! Hey!

90
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,540
Get up!

91
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,340
A restorative!

92
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,750
Thanks...

93
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,530
What were you doing?!

94
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,900
Stuff...

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,510
He's still buried.

96
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,980
Leave him be for now.
Where are the others?

97
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,680
They were gone when I came to...

98
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,580
Those coldhearted bastards!

99
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,700
But that's alright. We can
just follow their footprints.

100
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,420
Umm, footprints?

101
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,780
Say what?!

102
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
You're actually Crocodile?!

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,990
Don't be stupid!

104
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,460
Huh? We got separated?

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,930
You moron!

106
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,800
Why didn't we go after them sooner?!

107
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,260
That would be because of you!

108
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,940
Chopper! You smell things good!

109
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,260
I'm already trying. But
I don't smell anything at all.

110
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,240
Then we have no clues at all?

111
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,680
Which way is the wind blowing from?

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,190
I don't know the direction,
but it's coming from our left.

113
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,550
Left, huh? That at least
means they didn't go that way.

114
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,050
You're just makin' that up.

115
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,650
Shut up! Stay here if that's
what you want! Let's go, Chopper!

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,880
Yeah...

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,120
C'mon, wait for me!
Don't leave me behind!

118
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,120
So hot...

119
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,470
Will be he all right?

120
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,570
He's not the kind to
kick the bucket so easily.

121
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,270
Say.

122
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,240
Yeah?

123
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,410
Is pirate life always like this?

124
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,470
Like what?

125
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,180
Always climbing snowy
mountains, crossing deserts...

126
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,470
Ain't that the truth?

127
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,330
But we're just a little out of the
ordinary. Plus there's our captain.

128
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,190
I think I might've gotten on
board a not-so-good ship...

129
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,080
What a coincidence. I was just
thinking the same thing myself.

130
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,140
Say.

131
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,710
Huh?

132
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,030
You're the most veteran
crew member here, right?

133
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,740
I guess, but there's not that
much of a difference between us.

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,070
Why did you join?

135
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,070
Why do you ask?

136
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,420
To me, since I just joined,
it seems like everyone's a maverick.

137
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,220
Especially you.

138
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,590
That's true. In my case, things
pretty much just turned out this way.

139
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,090
The others are the same.
Our real goals are different from his.

140
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,600
We're trying to do what we want to do.

141
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,900
It's crazy. It's just like
someone said before.

142
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,830
On the outside,
we have no teamwork at all.

143
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,250
Especially given our captain.
He's a real handful.

144
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,930
I think so, too.

145
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,520
But, really, what is teamwork?

146
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,110
Is helping each other and
protecting each other enough?

147
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,720
Some people say so,

148
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,090
but, sorry, that only sounds
like they're fooling themselves.

149
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,330
I think teamwork only begins

150
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,940
when everyone risks their lives
to do what they can and then says,

151
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,200
"I did it! You're up next!
If you can't do it, I'll kill you!"

152
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,480
When you think about it that way,

153
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,280
what's wrong with having
mavericks as companions?

154
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,670
That's my opinion, anyway.

155
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,740
So that's what Usopp meant by,
"Just do what you can!"

156
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,710
It sounds like BS
when he says it, though.

157
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,650
As for why I still stay with him...

158
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,080
...being by his side all this time's
given me another goal to strive for.

159
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,770
Another goal?

160
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,030
Sorry. I dunno how to answer about it.

161
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,990
I found shade!

162
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,370
Gum-Gum...

163
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,270
...Rocket!

164
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,090
Whoo!

165
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,260
It's nice and cool!

166
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,000
I oughta chop you apart!

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,320
Oh! My bad! My bad!

168
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,000
Huh? Where's Chopper?

169
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,120
Oh! There he is!

170
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,900
What's he doing out there?
Is he trying to act funny?

171
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,350
Yes. It was my fault. I'm sorry.

172
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,650
Geez! What was the point
of that conversation--

173
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,120
Hey. I didn't know
you were a comedian.

174
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm not!

175
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,220
Oh! You're okay?

176
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,490
Dammit! That hurts!

177
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,710
What is this place?

178
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,570
What's this?

179
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,850
What is this?

180
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,410
What's something like this...

181
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,810
...doing underground?

182
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,830
Why are you down here?!

183
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,870
I used my arms.

184
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm asking why!

185
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,870
Just 'cause.

186
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,270
You idiot!

187
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,340
With you down here too, we might
get separated from Chopper!

188
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,440
Without him, we'll never meet
up with Vivi and the others!

189
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,210
Oh! That's okay!

190
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,110
Why is that?!

191
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,750
Because Chopper was
falling down here too!

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,710
See?

193
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,010
Oww...

194
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,730
What is this place?

195
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,930
Heya. You seem to be alright.

196
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,260
Zoro! Luffy! Where is this place?

197
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,240
No idea. But whatever it is,
it's definitely underground.

198
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,770
Underground?

199
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,710
I'm exhausted!
Let's take a short break!

200
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,880
Yes, Nami-san!

201
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,400
C'mon! You're pathetic!

202
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,090
Easy for you to say! You rode Lashes!
We gotta walk the whole way!

203
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,770
Thanks, Lashes!

204
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,830
Vivi?

205
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,790
Will Luffy-san and the
others know where to find us?

206
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,460
I think they'll be fine.

207
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,760
We're on top of a hill. It stood
out clearly, even from far away.

208
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,520
I hope so...

209
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,720
Say. How much further to Yuba?

210
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,500
Seeing as we made it to these ruins,

211
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,110
we should be there by night
if we continue walking.

212
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,880
Close, at last...

213
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,810
Oh? So these are ruins?

214
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,270
Yes. I believe they're
from quite an old era.

215
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,350
Civilizations first began
here thousands of years ago.

216
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,890
Many kingdoms have risen and fallen.

217
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,060
Resettlement in search of water,
the occasional war...

218
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,790
Ruins of such things remain
all throughout this land.

219
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,430
Many are full of mystery.

220
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,870
And time flowed on, leading to
the Alabasta dynasty of today?

221
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,080
That's an epic story. A prosperous
kingdom, destined to disappear...

222
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,280
It's almost romantic.

223
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,440
Sanji-kun!

224
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,510
Sorry, Vivi-chan!
I didn't mean it like that!

225
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,720
It was just, you know, a figure of speech...

226
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,780
It's all right.

227
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,780
I've often felt the same way as of late.

228
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,600
Just what is a country?

229
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,670
Even if the ruler of a land changes,
its people will keep on living.

230
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,540
Culture, lifestyle...

231
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,010
If those stay the same even
when a country changes,

232
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,830
I wonder if it's really necessary
to struggle to protect the country.

233
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,980
Certainly, there are other
things that need protecting.

234
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,110
Ever since the sand pirates and the
town with the fake rebel soldiers,

235
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,100
I've been thinking that way a lot.

236
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm sorry! That's just me being strange!

237
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,100
I haven't found the answers either!

238
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,420
But I do know what we must do now!

239
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,000
Baroque Works' scheming is about
to cause a meaningless war!

240
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,570
We must stop it, at all costs!

241
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,880
What they're trying to do
is throw this land into ruin!

242
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,060
I don't care if it leaves a
dark splotch in our history!

243
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,970
I absolutely refuse to let
Crocodile have his way!

244
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,030
Well, we should get going!

245
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,420
Usopp-san! Are you all right?!

246
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,860
Are you kidding? I can't control
the strength welling up in me!

247
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,600
Liar.

248
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,530
Oh, shut up!

249
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,820
They'll stop in a second!

250
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,670
I'll show you how gutsy Manly Usopp is!

251
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,020
I'll never fall to my knees easily!

252
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,550
What's the big idea?!

253
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,450
Well, we should get going, Vivi.

254
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,430
You fell easily.

255
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,450
Eh? But what about Luffy-san?

256
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,420
You're such a worrywart.

257
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,870
He says he's going
to kick Crocodile's butt.

258
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,150
Once he has a clear goal,
you can let him do his own thing.

259
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,730
You know that!

260
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,470
Yes!

261
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,960
My eyes've adjusted.

262
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,900
On closer look,
we're inside a giant dome.

263
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,070
Built by people, no less.

264
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,840
Huh?

265
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,000
These are probably
ancient ruins or something.

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,390
How can you tell?

267
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,640
Look at this. See all the
picture-like writing on this wall?

268
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,650
I saw it in a book or something before.
These are ancient letters.

269
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,770
Who cares about that stuff?

270
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,420
It's so nice and cool in here!

271
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,270
If you're right, then what is
this place doing underground?

272
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,590
I don't really know...

273
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,540
Was it built underground, or did
it get buried after it was built?

274
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,490
Either way, I get the feeling they
were trying to hide this building...

275
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,310
Dunno who did it,
but they sure worked hard.

276
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,580
In any case, it's none of my business,
and it doesn't interest me.

277
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,860
What we gotta do now is get the
hell outta here. Right, Captain?

278
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,980
Really? But it's cool in here.

279
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,310
Just get up!

280
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:24,290
No! No! Let's stay here a
little longer! It's hot outside!

281
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,730
Okay! Time to get outta here!
We gotta meet up with the others!

282
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,430
So that's Zoro's comedy hole?

283
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,200
Shut up!

284
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,280
Alright! Gum-Gum...

285
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,380
...Pistol!

286
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,970
What are you doing?

287
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,680
Darn it! I missed 'cause
the target's so small!

288
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,160
Alright! Got it!

289
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,280
Again, what are you trying to do?!

290
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,420
Just grab onto the boulder above the hole!

291
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,700
This is getting annoying!

292
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,540
Gum-Gum...

293
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,170
...Gatling!

294
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,560
Alright! All better!

295
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,920
Are you crazy?!

296
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,130
What are you gonna grab on to
now that you broke that boulder?!

297
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,140
It's okay! I got an idea!

298
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,130
Huh?!

299
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,300
Chopper. You should probably turn little.

300
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,060
Huh?

301
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,290
Gum-Gum...

302
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,220
Oh, now I see...

303
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,560
Grab on!

304
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,800
Just give it up. This is the only way!

305
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,520
Okay.

306
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,650
Here goes!

307
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,590
...Spring!

308
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,260
Yahoo!

309
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,870
How are we going to land?!

310
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,930
Heck if I know!

311
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,540
You don't mean--?!

312
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,650
I told you to just give it up!

313
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,740
Nobody mentioned this!

314
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,620
Successful escape!

315
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,590
Where'd they go?

316
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,330
Oh, there they are!

317
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,290
I think I did choose
the wrong ship to ride on...

318
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,910
We're on the same wavelength today...

319
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,350
I was just thinking the same thing...

320
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,350
Usopp. You're falling behind.

321
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,720
What happened to
showing how gutsy you are?

322
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,350
I-I only said that out of spirit...

323
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,260
Hang in there! Just a little further!

324
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,700
Still worried?

325
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,070
Oh, no...

326
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,460
It's written all over your face.

327
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,920
I'm sorry. I do have faith in them, but...

328
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,520
I'm guessing you'll never
get over being a worrier.

329
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,150
But that has its good points, too.

330
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,790
You people are amazing.

331
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,720
Eh?

332
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,070
I've felt that way ever since Little Garden.

333
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,830
How can you have so much
faith in your friends?

334
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,160
How?

335
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,730
It's not something I'm conscious of.
I've never even thought about it.

336
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,400
That's what's amazing.
Having unconditional faith in someone.

337
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,500
That's not very easy to have.

338
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,170
Hmm. I'm not really sure,
but maybe it's because

339
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,820
we all do what we can
as best as we can?

340
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,300
A while back, he said
something on the island I lived on.

341
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,460
I don't know how to
use swords, you bastard!

342
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,180
I don't know how to sail the oceans!

343
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,050
I can't cook!

344
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,080
I can't lie, either!

345
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,600
Hey, now!

346
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,890
I'm confident that
I can't live without help!

347
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,140
I remember those words very well...

348
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,400
I thought,
"Oh, this is how these pirates are..."

349
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,460
Alone, there's a limit to your strength.

350
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,390
Sometimes, things you really want
to do are too much for one person.

351
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,710
You need friends.

352
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,060
But it amounts to nothing if those
friends don't do what they can.

353
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,240
Whoops! Sorry that wasn't an answer!

354
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,960
Thank you!

355
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
I can't keep my thoughts
straight in this heat!

356
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,020
That answered plenty.

357
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,630
Yes...

358
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,810
That may be one of this country's forms.

359
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,930
Hey! Hurry up!

360
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,380
Of course he gets energetic
when it starts to cool off...

361
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:12,930
What is it?

362
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
The wind has changed direction.
I smell something!

363
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,130
What?!

364
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,250
No doubt about it! It's Nami's perfume!

365
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,360
It's this way!

366
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,790
Way to go! Luffy!

367
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,430
We found Nami and the others!
In the sunset direction!

368
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,560
For reals?!

369
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,830
Hey! Guys!

370
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,570
Don't rush off on your own!
We'll get separated again, you moron!

371
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,410
When I'm with them,
I start to see many things...

372
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,000
These people may have the answer!

373
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

374
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,990
I continue on to the ends of emotion

375
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:38,630
I scoop up my hands, and the sand
and time that spills from them

376
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:45,670
show me that this is what
I was born to do

377
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:57,820
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

378
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:08,460
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

379
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,670
no one knows about

380
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,680
Did we make it to Yuba?!
I can't tell with all this sand!

381
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,820
The city doesn't look right!

382
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,080
This is horrible!

383
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,520
Wasn't this an oasis?!

384
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,820
The sand has raised the ground!
The oasis has been swallowed up!

385
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,260
And there doesn't seem to be any water...

386
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,530
The rebel army doesn't seem to be here!

387
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,260
I will stop the revolt!

388
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,630
On the next episode of One Piece!

389
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,730
"Spiders Café at 8 O'Clock--
The Enemy Leaders Gather"

390
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
