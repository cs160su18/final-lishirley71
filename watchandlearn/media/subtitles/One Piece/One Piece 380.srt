2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,600
Yes! I swear that we will come back for you.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,000
And then let's go on adventures
together all across the ocean!

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,180
We're buddies!

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,400
Laboon! We'll now go into the
Grand Line and travel around the world.

51
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,310
But you wait for us here.

52
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,870
"Bink's Booze! The Song that
Connects the Past with the Present!"

53
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,170
Hey, Brook! Your quick draw is amazing!

54
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,550
Please teach me how to fight with the sword.

55
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,730
Waterspouts?! But we had
clear skies a second ago!

56
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,190
We have to get away from here!

57
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,570
Common sense is meaningless on these waters!

58
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,370
I swear, there is no telling what
this ocean will throw at us next.

59
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,920
It's killer!

60
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,710
Yeah, but that is what makes

61
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,970
the booze at the end of
the day taste so great!

62
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,880
Isn't that right, Brook?

63
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,390
Please play that song for us again today.

64
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,390
I was expecting you to say that!

65
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,100
Are you ready?

66
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,560
Yeah! Let's hear it!

67
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,030
A mirror...?

68
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,320
Oh, yeah. I'm a skeleton now.

69
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,740
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

70
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,250
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

71
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,300
That hurts! That really hurts, Captain!
Why are you hanging me up?!

72
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,090
Shut it! You've got nerve to
fight over something so stupid!

73
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,090
But Captain, his stray bullet
nearly got me killed in combat!

74
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,980
You're alive, aren't you?!
Besides, he offered you an apology.

75
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,720
Don't nag over the past! It's unsightly!

76
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,770
Ouch!

77
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,200
That pain is proof you're still alive!

78
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,330
True enough!

79
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,180
The stars!

80
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a clear, starry night.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,170
Do you think Laboon is
looking up at these stars?

82
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,240
Well, Captain?

83
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,090
Hey, guys! Check this out! Brook is
getting mushy on us!

84
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,310
Kn-Knock that off! You're embarrassing me!

85
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,970
It's the Navy Headquarters!
What should we do?

86
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,930
Don't go chicken on me! Fight back!

87
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,980
Wow! Look at this.

88
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,230
The captain's bounty went up again.

89
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,810
Aren't I great?

90
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,660
Let's party!

91
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,790
Yorkie! Yorkie! Let your infamy
resound clear to the Twin Cape!

92
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,450
This is bad!

93
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,110
Hey, the captain...! Something is
wrong with Captain Yorkie!

94
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,960
What?

95
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,540
A plague?

96
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,080
Yeah.

97
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,790
Don't go in his room.

98
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,700
A few dozen crew members have been infected.

99
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,260
They may have contracted it
in that jungle we just visited.

100
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,010
It's an unknown virus. I can't treat it!

101
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,260
This is a nightmare!

102
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,560
If I make one false move,
everyone onboard might die!

103
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,100
Captain!

104
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,470
Captain Yorkie!

105
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,740
Don't sound so sad.

106
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,000
You'll mar the name of the Rumbar Pirates
that make crying children laugh.

107
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,960
I am pulling out of the Grand Line
a little ahead of you.

108
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,610
I will take this worn-out ship...

109
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,290
now that it has become
a carrier for the virus.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,970
Push forward on a new ship.

111
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,680
Captain...!

112
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,350
I never dreamed I would drop out like this...

113
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,830
We will take our chances... and try
to escape through the Calm Belt.

114
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,640
Hey, everything will work out!

115
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm sorry, men.

116
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,340
Give my regards to Laboon.

117
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,780
Wipe those sniveling expressions off
your faces! Get your acts together!

118
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,510
Yes, sir!

119
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,990
It's not good for you
guys to hang out in here.

120
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,490
Get going! Take care...

121
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,840
Captain Yorkie is right.

122
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,300
Come along. Let's head on out, everyone.

123
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,830
Brook...

124
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,650
Yes?

125
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,100
I'm filled with regret!

126
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,900
Captain Yorkie...!

127
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,350
I will never forget those words!

128
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,100
Do you hear me, Captain?!

129
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,160
I have chiseled them into my heart!

130
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,620
Take care of yourself, Captain!

131
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,240
We're going to travel on separate ships now,

132
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,840
but let's survive so we
can see everyone again!

133
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,120
You'll take off that mask...

134
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,790
...and sing with everyone again!

135
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,230
Hey, Brook...

136
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,780
Please see me off...

137
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,770
...with that song I love so much...

138
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,070
♪ We're on our way... ♪

139
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,950

143

"10 Years After Leaving Twin Cape
-Florian Triangle-"

144
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,850
I took off my pants!

145
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,870
Oh, dear! That was so embarrassing!

146
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,030
This is so fun! Even when
I'm alone, I can have fun!

147
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,320
Hello!

148
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,450
45 degree angle!

149
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,950
Look! Someone, look!

150
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,670
Oh, yeah! I'm all alone!

151
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,080
Hey, Brook! Are you gonna sleep forever?

152
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,180
Wake up! We spotted an island!

153
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,610
It's a summer island! It has a beach!

154
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,940
Huh? What?

155
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,350
Uh? Ah, uh, excuse me!

156
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,700
Huh? What is this?

157
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,270
Wait! What gives?!

158
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,690
What's keeping you, Brook?

159
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,530
We can't get started without you!

160
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,690
Everyone is here!

161
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,420
What's this? It makes me so happy!

162
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,950
What's this? How come you are alive? Why?

163
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,220
What are you talking about?
Isn't it time you woke up?

164
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,200
Ow...

165
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,060
That hurt...

166
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,900
For that to have hurt, it means
this isn't a dream. It's real!

167
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,070
That was all a dream! Thank goo--

168
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,540
Do you think Captain Yorkie made it
through the Calm Belt in one piece?

169
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,920
The ocean is a mysterious place...

170
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,050
Let's carry on his will and plow forward.

171
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,020
We will head toward Laboon on this new ship!

172
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,390
It's morning!

173
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,190
I'm up! I'm up!

174
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,020
This is a nasty storm!
The sails are gonna get torn to shreds!

175
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,640
This is nothing! Let's
sing our way through it!

176
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,780
At long last, Brook has
gotten a bounty on his head!

177
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,700
Hey, why'd you stop?
Keep the music going, Brook!

178
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,260
You heard him! I was dancing
with chopsticks up my nose!

179
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,050
Please wait a moment.

180
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,430
Let's see...

181
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,100
--Awesome!
--That's how your head works?!

182
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:23,140
A long time ago, I bought this from a
merchant ship. It's called a "Tone Dial."

183
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,030
It's an unusual shell that records sounds
and allows you to play them back.

184
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,520
Oh, it's from the sky island!

185
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,860
You've heard of it?

186
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,360
When I see Laboon, I want
him to listen to this.

187
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,200
I keep it close to my heart at all times.

188
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,370
But since I'm a skeleton,
I don't have a heart!

189
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,370
Have you recorded something onto it?

190
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,630
It's a song.

191
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,910
It contains my crewmates singing
when they were still alive.

192
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,520
It's our message to Laboon:
We were happy and cheerful

193
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,510
when we finished our journey.

194
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,010
May I play it for you now?

195
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,730
Oh, I wanna hear it! I bet Laboon'll love it!

196
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,190
Without further ado.

197
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,950
How many people... are still alive?

198
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,880
We might be alive, but it doesn't
look like we'll pull through this.

199
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,500
So this is what it means to get wiped out...

200
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,980
They laced their weapons with poison...

201
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,220
And we've lost the doc.

202
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,560
I'm a pirate. I've always
been prepared to die...

203
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,060
My one regret is...

204
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,130
Laboon...!

205
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,560
Brook, does your Revive-Revive Fruit work?

206
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,820
I'm not sure. I've never died before.

207
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,450
I know. If we're going to die anyway,
let's enjoy the experience.

208
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,410
Would you care to sing?

209
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:11,760
If the power of the Revive-Revive Fruit
truly does bring me back to life,

210
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,120
I will take this to Laboon! I swear it!

211
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,320
A Tone Dial...

212
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,480
We will record the song that Laboon,

213
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,060
the captain, and all of us loved so dearly!

214
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,050
Laboon is waiting at that cape under

215
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,500
the belief that we'll return
today or tomorrow...

216
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,480
I will take it to him!

217
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,870
That sounds great!

218
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,990
Yeah! Guys, don't keel over
before the song is done.

219
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,330
Let's give Laboon...

220
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,580
...the Rumbar Pirate's
choral number of a lifetime!

221
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,510
Huh? I can sing along with this song!

Where is everyone?
This has turned into a quartet.

270
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,500
A trio...

271
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,060
A duet!

272
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,470
A solo!

273
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,420
What is this? Why is the
accompaniment the last to go?

274
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,640
If you want to join my crew,
you must have a love of music!

275
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,630
Raise the sail of the Rumbar Pirates
that make crying children laugh!

276
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,310
Laboon, I swear that we will come back!

277
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,220
Please be here waiting for us!

278
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:58,010
Laboon, if you have been waiting
there for the past fifty years...

279
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,800
...could you give me just
another year or two?

280
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,020
I take pride in being a pirate!

281
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:16,000
If you are facing the wall, I want to greet
you from the front, just like I promised!

282
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,790
I am the dead and skeletonized Brook.

283
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,790
I am a wanted man!

284
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,000
I have a bounty for 33 million Berries.

285
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,050
As of today, my life belongs to you,
Captain Straw Hat Luffy!

286
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

287
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,850
"A New Crewmate!
The Musician, Humming Brook!"

288
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
