2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,570
The historic War of the Best
in Marineford has ended.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,620
10 years ago, in the East Blue,

61
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,700
Luffy met Ace for the
first time when he was 7.

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,910
I won't say it!

63
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,670
Then you die.

64
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,230
Don't!

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,480
"I Won't Run! Ace's Desperate
Rescue Operation!"

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,260
Outta my way!

67
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,990
--It's him, Porchemy-san!
--He stole the money from us! Damn you!

68
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,030
What?

69
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,320
A-Ace!

70
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,500
You made it easier for us
by coming here voluntarily!

71
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,460
We were having a hard time
making your friend talk.

72
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,630
Ace!

73
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,840
L-Let me go!

74
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
Sabo!

75
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,190
Porchemy-san!

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,520
Ace! Sabo!

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,020
It kind of hurts. Hey!

78
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,940
Do you know what happens
when you mess with adults?!

79
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,330
I'll fight you! Sabo, help him!

80
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,330
Ace!

81
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,960
He has a sword! Be careful!

82
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,340
Oh, he got the knife!

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,890
Porchemy-san, that kid...!

84
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,930
Let's go, Ace!

85
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,900
Go ahead!

86
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,360
You fool! Hurry up!

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,110
When I come to face someone, I won't run!

88
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,700
What'd you say?! You little shit!

89
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,320
Don't do it! He's not like
the thugs in the city!

90
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,800
You got that right!

91
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,730
Alright! Enough playing
around! That's our money.

92
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,540
Give it back to us peacefully, brat!

93
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,150
You must been possessed by
some evil spirit, right?

94
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,010
Give the money back so you won't regret it.

95
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,390
We have better plans for that money!

96
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,400
Wh...

97
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,710
What did you say?!

98
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,980
Wait here for a minute!

99
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,440
You're so reckless!
Why are you always like this?!

100
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,070
I won't run!

101
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,360
Stop talking crap!

102
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,500
If I'm beaten by kids, I may
as well quit being a pirate!

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,040
--We'll make sure you quit!
--We'll make sure you quit!

104
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,580
I'm gonna kill all of you!

105
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,020
I heard the whole story,
Porchemy. How pathetic.

106
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,230
Did you honestly get beaten by kids?

107
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,210
I'm sorry, Captain Bluejam... The money is...

108
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,450
Don't look at me! I don't
even want to see your face!

109
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,300
Now, who will get my money back?

110
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,210
Don't tell me we'll let
it go without a fight.

111
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,880
Of course not. We'll get it back right away.

112
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,000
You have a bad habit, Ace!

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,770
When faced with a real
pirate it's best to run!

114
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,900
Why do you have such a death wish?

115
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,530
This doesn't feel right.
I liked the one I had.

116
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,710
We made a stupid mistake.
The Bluejam clan won't forgive us.

117
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,080
They'll come after us!

118
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, that was scary!
I thought I was gonna die!

119
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,010
You're so annoying! Shut up!
Stop crying already!

120
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,220
I don't like cowards or people who cry a lot!

121
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,980
Th-Thank you!

122
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,150
You...

123
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,860
You helped me!

124
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,700
--You...!
--Whoa, he's just being thankful.

125
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,290
Why didn't you cough it
up in the first place?

126
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,960
They're kind of people who'd kill
women or kids without hesitation!

127
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,550
I thought if I said anything...
you wouldn't be my friend.

128
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,760
It's better than dying, isn't it?

129
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,720
Why do you wanna become my friend that much?

130
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,100
Because...

131
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,560
Didn't I give you a hard time until now?

132
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,040
How could you follow me this far?

133
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,990
Because...

134
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,870
Because I have nobody else to trust!

135
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,830
I can't go back to Windmill Village
and I don't like the mountain bandits!

136
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,290
If I didn't follow you, I'd be all alone!

137
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,560
Being lonely is more
painful than getting hurt!

138
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,340
Where are your parents?

139
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,220
Grandpa is all I have.

140
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,180
Is it easy for you when I'm around?

141
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,680
Uh-huh.

142
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,310
--It's hard without me?
--Uh-huh.

143
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,030
What if Gold Roger had a child?

144
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,860
I hope that there isn't such a child!

145
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,360
He must be some kind of devil
who'd be better off dead!

146
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,580
Do you want me to live?

147
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,580
Of course I do!

148
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,180
I see.

149
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,850
But I don't like spoiled kids like you.

150
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,930
I'm not spoiled! I'm strong!

151
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,400
Strong?! You're not strong
at all! You cry like a girl!

152
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,070
Have you ever gotten hit by
a spiky thing? I'm only 7!

153
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,120
When I become your age - 10, I'll
stop crying and become stronger!

154
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,430
I wouldn't cry even if I were
7, stupid! I'm not like you!

155
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,210
I'm gonna become stronger than anyone!

156
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,250
I promised Shanks that I'd
become a great pirate!

157
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,420
--You? Become a pirate?
--Yes!

158
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,130
--No way!
--Yes way!

159
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,230
Okay, that's enough!

160
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,850
Hey, by the way, I have a little problem.

161
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,390
--What? A problem?
--Uh-huh.

162
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:15,270
Bluejam and the others will try to kill the
three of us after this for sure, right?

163
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,320
Well, I think so.

164
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,150
This forest that I've been living is close
to where they are - the Cove of Pirates!

165
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,910
What if they attack me when
I fall asleep exhausted?

166
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,960
--You're gonna die.
--Yeah, you're gonna die.

167
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,210
Right?

168
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,130
That's why I need your help.

169
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,320
Guys, huddle up.

170
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,450
Why are they wounded? They're all bandaged!

171
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,420
Whoa! Boss! Boss! We have a problem!

172
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,000
Hmm? It's still early. What's wrong...

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,010
Whoa! What's going on here?!

174
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,260
1, 2...

175
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,510
Huh?

176
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,010
1, 2...

177
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,970
Huh?

178
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Ace, Luffy...

179
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,200
Huh?

180
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,480
Ace, Luffy... Huh?

181
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,520
Ace, Luffy... Huh? Ace, Luffy... Huh?

182
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,360
Ace... Luffy... Huh?

183
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,910
Ace, Luffy, huh? Ace, Luffy,
huh? Ace, Luffy, huh?

184
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,870
Ace! Luffy! Who is that?!

185
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,210
Who is who?

186
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,000
It's still early - you're too loud!

187
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,880
How come there is one more kid?!

188
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,010
Who the hell are you?!

189
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,720
Are you talking about me?

190
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,230
I'm Sabo! Hey, you must be Dadan!

191
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,680
Sabo? I've heard your name before!

192
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,150
Oh yeah? That makes it easier! Thank
you for taking care of me from today!

193
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,600
"Taking care"? Don't tell me
that you're gonna stay here...

194
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,710
Don't answer me with a fart!

195
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,360
You must be kidding! I heard that
you're a worthless brat, too!

196
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,260
Oh yeah? I heard that you're
a worthless old bag, too!

197
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,010
That's unnecessary information!

198
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,740
I don't wanna look after one more brat!

199
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,020
But I heard that you're a good worthless
old bag because you can't refuse a request.

200
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,730
I heard that you're a truly
manly worthless old bag!

201
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:06,030
"Truly manly"? I'm a woman!
I'm not a gender bender!

202
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,430
Ace, Luffy, Sabo!

203
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,940
I'm giving you a place to stay!
You gotta get to work already!

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,050
Thank you, Dadan!

205
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,120
--See ya!
--See ya!

206
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,580
Hey, Luffy! You stay here and do
some laundry and clean the house!

207
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,750
No way!

208
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,870
Oh, Ace, Sabo, wait!

209
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,750
Honestly! What annoying brats!

210
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,420
Oh yeah!

211
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,050
I forget to tell them.

212
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,550
Hey, Dadan!

213
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,680
While we're gone, the Bluejam
clan might come by so be careful!

214
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,990
The Bluejam clan might come by? Why?

215
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,910
Because we beat some of his crew up! Bye!

216
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,200
What?!

217
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,280
Dadan sure is an understanding
worthless old bag!

218
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,170
She's still a worthless old bag!

219
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,300
Plus she's a mountain bandit
and her face is scary!

220
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
What are we gonna do now?

221
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,640
First...

222
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,550
Eat something!

223
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,680
Okay, let's eat!

224
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,580
Luffy, so you ate the Devil Fruit?

225
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,750
Uh-huh!

226
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,420
No wonder you can't swim.

227
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,640
Here, you can have this, too.

228
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,210
Thanks!

229
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,300
You're too kind, Sabo.

230
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,260
Well, what's wrong with that?

231
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,970
So, what fruit did you eat?

232
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,350
Gum-Gum!

233
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,730
Gum-Gum? Gum?!

234
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,520
That's right!

235
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,110
In exchange for the ability to swim,
your body turned to rubber? So crappy!

236
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,950
It's not crappy! I can use
a lot of unbeatable attacks!

237
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,030
That's good. Good for you.

238
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,540
You have such a fat mouth even
though you can't catch a fish.

239
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Your body really is rubber! Interesting!

240
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,150
Don't play with my body!

241
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:19,220
But rubber surely stretches
and shrinks and expands so...

242
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,920
...maybe it's useful when you're fighting!

243
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,680
Right?! Oh yeah, I came
up with another attack.

244
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,570
It's called "Gum-Gum Balloon"! I can
deflect cannonballs and everything!

245
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,030
Wow! Can you do it for me now?

246
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,090
Okay, I'll do it just for
you! Ace can't see it.

247
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,700
Don't look!

248
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,540
Here we go! Gum-Gum...

249
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,210
What?! What is it?! What the hell?!

250
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,510
Awesome! You're getting bigger and bigger!

251
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,180
...Balloon! See it?! It's cool, isn't it?!

252
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,500
Well, I don't think it's cool...

253
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,680
It's good for working off my meal!

254
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,880
What are you doing?!

255
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,360
Sabo, kick it back!

256
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,610
Ah, okay.

257
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,860
Stop it!

258
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,110
Is that the unbeatable attack
that will deflect cannonballs?!

259
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,870
Stop it!

260
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,700
Then, why don't you deflect my kick?!

261
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,160
Stop it!

262
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,640
--Wait! You can't just eat and run!
--Wait! You can't just eat and run!

263
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,770
--You bastard!
--You bastard!

264
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,230
--Take this!
--Take this!

265
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,120
Well, what can I say? Let it go.

266
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,580
I can't! I almost got eaten!

267
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,210
Calm down. You can have a lot
of crocodile meat for dinner.

268
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,880
Then I forgive you guys.

269
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,040
That easily?

270
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,220
I wanna eat the crocodile already.
I can't wait until dinner.

271
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,090
Ace! I wanna check something quickly.

272
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,850
Can you come with me?

273
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,240
--Did you find it?
--Look carefully!

274
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,410
I'm glad that we moved the "pirate savings".

275
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,370
Yeah.

276
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,440
Do you wanna check the Gray Terminal, too?

277
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,660
Yeah, okay. Why don't you go home now?

278
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,670
No!

279
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,090
He won't listen to anyone.

280
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,770
There are hooligans from the city
and Bluejam's people everywhere.

281
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,680
They're serious!

282
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,230
I bet that Bluejam got really frustrated.

283
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,580
Hey, guys! The kids that you're
looking for are all here!

284
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,240
There they are!

285
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,950
Stop! You can't run from us!

286
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
I can't believe that they bought
over pops at the Terminal.

287
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,430
We'd better lay low for a
while until things calm down.

288
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,050
Who cares? We'll just fight if they find us.

289
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:55,870
That's true but we don't have
to look for trouble ourselves.

290
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,500
I agree with Sabo!

291
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,690
You just shut up!

292
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,140
Bluejam... The kids made quite an enemy!

293
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,080
I'm sure that they're gonna find
this place and come by pretty soon!

294
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,320
There is no way that we can defeat them...

295
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,960
Maybe this is the end of the Dadan family!

296
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,470
I have to say goodbye to the
humble-but-sweet mountain bandit's life?

297
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:31,430
It's better to quit the mountain bandit
business than to get exterminated!

298
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,910
"We can't defeat them"?
"Out of business"?

299
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,480
How pathetic you guys are!

300
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,030
Don't you take pride in
being a mountain bandit?!

301
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,640
It's easy!

302
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,670
If they come by,

303
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,410
we can just hand Ace and
the other two over to them!

304
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,160
But, boss, how do we explain it to Garp?!

305
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,090
Plus, Bluejam is not the kind of guy who
will be satisfied by just handing them over!

306
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,510
Th-Then...

307
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,100
Then?

308
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,430
Let's just pretend that
we don't know anything!

309
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,390
Now, try it! We gotta practice!

310
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,900
You guys, are Ace and Sabo
here? Just spit it out!

311
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,970
I-I don't know...

312
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,650
Terrible liars!

313
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,410
Boss! Boss! Ace and the other two are back!

314
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,890
Ace's close friend Sabo
started to live with them

315
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,710
after being forced to
leave the Gray Terminal.

316
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,350
Ace, Sabo, Luffy.

317
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,500
These three soon began spending their time

318
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,520
fighting with wild animals in
the mountain and in the jungle

319
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,070
and with hooligans from the
city and pirates at the cove.

320
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,080
In the end, the people at
the center of the kingdom

321
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,600
came to know their wrongdoing!

322
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,880
The names of Luffy, Ace, and Sabo

323
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,250
gradually gain fame among
the thugs in the town.

324
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,070
Then, one day, the three
of them meet a certain boy.

325
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,520
That meeting would change
their destinies in a big way!

326
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,090
On the next episode of One Piece!

327
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,860
"To The Sea Someday!
The Pledge of the Three Brats!"

328
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
