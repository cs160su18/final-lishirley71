2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,960
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,960
With Wyper leading the charge, the Shandians

21
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,840
take the fight to Upper Yard,
taking advantage of the fact

22
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,360
that the priests' eyes are focused on Gan Fall.

23
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,670
No matter what, head for "God's Shrine"!

24
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,230
Don't fear Eneru!

25
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,960
The Great Warrior Calgara is
our one and only Preserver!

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,670
Yeah!!

27
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,910
So you've come, Shandians!

28
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,420
After defeating Satori, Luffy and the
other two headed for the sacrificial altar.

29
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,510
The wounded Gan Fall,
and drowning Chopper...

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,050
Believe it or not, the one who rescued them
was a bird that was also found in Jaya.

31
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,770
There's a bunch of South Birds... But why...

32
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,690
Why are they this huge?!

33
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,820
So you're the ones that saved us?!

34
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,510
What?! He's God?!

35
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,460
Around that time, Nami, Zoro and Robin,
who reached the seashore,

36
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,250
discovered the shocking
secret behind Upper Yard.

37
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,150
This is the other half of the island that
was ripped up. This was part of Jaya!

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,270
The "city of gold" that once existed
on the ground and was seen by Noland...

39
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,670
...didn't sink into the ocean.

40
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,530
For 400 years... this part of Jaya has been...

41
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,580
...flying in the sky all this time!

42
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,920
"Jaya, City of Gold in the Sky!
Head for God's Shrine!"

43
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,240
Yahoo! Thank you, God!

44
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,090
I can't believe that the sky island we reached
after all this trouble was the city of gold!

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
This must be a reward for
behaving myself, right, God?

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,550
Hey, I thought you were
scared of this island's God?!

47
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,610
Hm? God? Oh, what's the big deal?

48
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,760
Is he worth more than gold?

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,450
But, you just said, "Thank you, God!"

50
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,270
She's not making any sense!

51
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,700
It's useless.

52
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,040
Hey, what is this place?!

53
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,790
I'll bet that this is the next ordeal area.

54
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,510
Another priest will appear. Be careful!

55
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,830
Aw, man... Come on, one ordeal is enough!

56
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,990
What is it gonna be?! String? Iron? Or Swamp?!

57
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,960
It looks like an ordinary grassy plain.

58
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,320
It's not ordinary! Open your
eyes and take a good look!

59
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,170
Those sticks all have skulls on them!

60
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,650
Oh, you're right! What the heck?!

61
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,010
Another one of those monstrous
priests is gonna show up?!

62
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,870
I'm excited! I wonder what kinda ordeal it'll be?

63
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,400
Are you nuts?! If the priests win, we'll
end up like the heads on those sticks.

64
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,890
There's no doubt about it!

65
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,100
Don't worry! We're not gonna lose!

66
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,580
Something's coming this way.

67
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,400
What?! Iron, String, Swamp...
Are they all coming together?!

68
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
That would save us a lot of time.

69
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,980
Ahhh! Here they come!!

70
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,410
You dirtbags! Gum-Gum...

71
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,530
...Balloon!!

72
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,830
What was that?!

73
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,740
Paramythia! He probably has the
power of the Super-Power Devil Fruit.

74
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,370
Wyper, are we gonna fight them?!

75
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,270
No, don't bother!

76
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,130
That guy...!

77
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,130
Hey, you! What're you doing?!
You ready to take us on?! You bastards!

78
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,730
So you were the Blue Sea
people acting up in Skypiea...

79
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,600
Hey, Luffy. That guy's the masked
guerrilla that we saw on the White Sea!

80
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,160
What's wrong with you?

81
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,450
He's running on the clouds!

82
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,780
Hey, stop! What do you want?!

83
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,840
To eliminate you!

84
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,450
Looks like he wants to fight.

85
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,390
Fine by me!

86
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,370
What's going on?!

87
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,470
They're scary! Sky islands are scary!

88
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,420
If you don't want to die, go back
to the Blue Sea immediately!

89
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,360
If you've got any funny ideas about
doing something on this island...

90
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,940
...we'll eliminate you along with Eneru.

91
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,310
So they're trying to kill Eneru?

92
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,990
Then does that mean the
guerrillas and God are different?

93
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,380
They're not priests?
Then let's leave them alone,

94
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,480
and get through here quickly, Luffy!

95
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,710
What'd you say, you dirtbag?!
C'mon! I'll beat you up!!

96
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,690
Ahh! Stop it! Please stop!

97
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm coming over there, so stay put!!

98
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,090
I'll pay you back for earlier with interest!!

99
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,510
I told you, "Go back."

100
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,770
Whether or not you have the
ability to go back is another story.

101
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,440
What's their story?

102
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,620
Well, we learned that they're enemies
with God Eneru and us as well.

103
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,140
Dammit...! What's with this island?

104
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,040
We're gonna move on.

105
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,680
My "Can't Go into Jungles" disease is...

106
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,530
Oh, I'm hungry.

107
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,770
How could you be hungry? I've had it!

108
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh yeah, Luffy, let's sing Sanji's
song to bring our spirits up!

109
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,210
♪ Take my hand... ♪

110
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,590
No, it goes like this!

111
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,460
I'll cover you!

112
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,070
Save our comrade!

113
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,560
Now!

114
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,470
Something's gonna happen!
Something's definitely gonna happen!

115
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,000
There's no way that we can
get through this safely!

116
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,670
We've got zoro, er, zero chance... zoro...

117
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,050
I wonder how Zoro's doing.

118
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,530
We've come quite a ways, haven't we, Sanji?

119
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,290
Haven't we, Sanji?!

120
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,510
Yeah, and that grassy plain
earlier turned out to be nothing.

121
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,800
Now that we've come this far,
I hope we can keep on going safely.

122
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,290
Yeah! We can! We definitely can!

123
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,640
What is it this time?! What the heck?

124
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,440
Look, Usopp!

125
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,820
This is fun!

126
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,630
Is there any point in winding the canal?

127
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,140
I'm getting dizzy!

128
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,410
This is fast!

129
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,090
Or rather, we're falling!!

130
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,360
Milky roads are fun!

131
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,300
Oh... I feel sick.

132
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,860
Hey, we've come really far.

133
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,540
I wonder if it'll be like this
the rest of the way to the altar.

134
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,060
The sun will set soon.

135
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,140
I can't see the sunset because of the clouds.

136
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,590
So they have twilight on the sky island, too.

137
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,350
Wyper! Kamakiri and I will fight here!

138
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,450
Help them over there!

139
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,290
Got it!

140
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,980
Chopper!

141
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,670
Where are you?!

142
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,060
What happened, Chopper?! Say something!

143
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,030
Hey, the Merry's mast is gone.

144
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,370
What kind of changes did he make?

145
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,580
You can't be serious! The ship was attacked!

146
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,630
Chopper! I'm sorry it took so long!

147
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,300
It's safe now to come out!
You're there, aren't you?!

148
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,010
Stop hiding and say something, Chopper!

149
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,040
I wonder if he was torn limb from limb.

150
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,620
Stop saying scary things!

151
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,690
Hey, Chopper! Are you there?!
Did something happen?!

152
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,920
Say something!

153
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
No--

154
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,440
No--

155
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,700
Nothing scary happened!

156
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,970
Okay, okay... You're strong.

157
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,820
So tell us everything that happened.

158
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,560
Whoa! We're going up
another tree! This is a big one!

159
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,330
Hey, this is no time for idle chit-chat, Luffy!

160
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,470
What is this? What's this feeling?

161
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,960
Don't you think there's gonna
be something at the end?

162
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,920
The priests might be waiting in surprise
for us at the end of the milky road.

163
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,680
This thing is so tall! I'm so excited!

164
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,370
Are we gonna spin around again?!

165
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,040
Hm? There're something there.

166
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,420
There they are! Are they priests?!

167
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,090
No, they're skysharks!

168
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,760
Oh, just skysharks, not priests.

169
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, seriously?!

170
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,380
Ahhh! They're huge!
We're gonna be swallowed!

171
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,290
Gum-Gum...

172
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,260
...Gatling!!

173
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,530
We're soaking wet!

174
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,740
Oh! Hey, look!

175
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,030
We found it! The Going Merry! That's the altar!

176
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,250
Yahoo!

177
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,700
Ahhh! Nami-san! Robin-chan!

178
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,270
Sorry to keep you waiting!

179
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,310
I've overcome the love ordeal to come here!

180
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,000
Aw, was that it? That was the ordeal?

181
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,760
Were you guys scared?!

182
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,770
Now that Captain Usopp is here, you'll be safe!

183
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,920
Looks like they're okay, too.

184
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,500
Phew, I'm relieved.

185
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,810
The mast is... gone...

186
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:06,400
U-Uhm... Usopp... I'm sorry.
I fought really hard...

187
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,220
...but a lot of things got burned.

188
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,610
Are your wounds okay?!

189
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,280
What?

190
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,180
Yes.

191
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,760
What a scary guy, using a
spear that can burn things.

192
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,630
I'm glad that it wasn't you that got burned.

193
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,300
We'll think about the ship later.

194
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,150
I'll become a more dependable man!!

195
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,360
Hey, Chopper! How did you
get rid of one of the priests?

196
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,140
I used the whistle.
The Sky Knight came to rescue me.

197
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,840
Oh? Where's that weird old guy?

198
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,470
"God"

199
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,900
So he fought this hard, even though
he gave us this whistle for free.

200
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,490
If it wasn't for the Sky Knight, both
the ship and I wouldn't have survived.

201
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,820
There're many things we'd like to ask him,

202
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,630
but we'll wait until he wakes up.

203
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,950
Thanks to you, too.

204
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,820
Luffy!!

205
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,640
Since the ship is in this
state and the sun's setting,

206
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,790
it looks like we won't be able to head
back to Angel Island until tomorrow.

207
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,340
In any case, let's head to the
forest and camp at the lakeshore.

208
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,770
Why?

209
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,570
The ship will get destroyed if
we have to fight here, right?

210
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,720
Use your head!

211
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,430
Also, it's probably a little
easier to fight on the shore.

212
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,620
Yay! Alright! Camping! Party time!

213
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,860
Yay!!

214
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,140
What? Hey, wait! We're in enemy territory!

215
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,620
You wanna camp?!

216
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,040
Alright! Then, let's start by
barbecuing those skysharks!

217
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,320
Yeah, this is yummy!

218
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,160
Geez, you'll eat anything.

219
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,190
Hey, this is pretty good.

220
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,320
Quiet! We're in the middle of reports.

221
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,710
We encountered Satori from the Illusion Forest,
a priest who uses surprise balls.

222
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,320
While the surprise balls made
the fight tough, the toughest part

223
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,100
was that he predicted our movements using
a technique called Mantra or something.

224
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,630
The priest Shura, who appeared out of
nowhere, uses a spear that burns anything.

225
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,300
Also, he seemed to predict my movements, too.

226
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,310
Although I tried to attack him
many times, he dodged each time.

227
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,640
The bird he was riding blew flames
and burned the main mast.

228
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,680
The Sky Knight was defeated, too.

229
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,850
You guys had a really hard time.

230
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,730
But we discovered that this
island is the other half of Jaya.

231
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,590
The city of gold didn't sink in the ocean,
but it flew up into the sky!

232
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,380
Alright! Well, everyone, thanks for your reports.

233
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,420
Based on your reports,
we've learned many things.

234
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,250
"The bird blows flames!
The spear burns things!"
"The sky island is actually part of Jaya, which we thought sank in the ocean!!"

235
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,250
However, the biggest discovery is this!

236
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,050
Believe it or not, this island is the city of gold,

237
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,600
the one that the Saruyama
Alliance was searching for!!

238
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,100
Really?!

239
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,680
I already said that, didn't I?!

240
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,330
So, what is this Mantra thing?

241
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,390
I don't know. Maybe it's like
an intuition or something.

242
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,130
Intuition, huh?

243
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,780
Hey, Chopper! Should I ground more?

244
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,040
Yes. Make it so that he can swallow.

245
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,320
His digestive tract is a little damaged.

246
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,380
Gold, huh? I've been waiting
for an adventure like this!

247
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,950
I can't wait!

248
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,300
That's what I wanted to hear!
This simplifies things!

249
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,250
Hey, hey, Luffy. Have you forgotten
the guerrilla's warning from earlier?

250
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,660
God's gonna get angry. He's scary!

251
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,670
That sounds fun.

252
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,000
Well, as pirates, we can't back off
when there's treasure close by, can we?

253
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,400
We've got enough enemies.
It's gonna be a survival game.

254
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,030
Sounds fun!

255
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:49,450
You guys... Shouldn't you be
at least a tiny bit afraid of God?!

256
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm not responsible for this.
You'll be punished, seriously!

257
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,540
Alright! Let's do it! Gold hunting!!

258
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Even if we're far apart

259
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,740
I don't want you to forget

260
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:38,420
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

261
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,000
You have a friend here to share the pain

262
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:52,600
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

263
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,100
I won't let it just be a dream

264
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,820
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

265
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:13,580
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

266
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,290
Oh, I can't wait to see the treasure!

267
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,710
Don't be so hasty. At any rate,
we'll start in the morning.

268
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,960
We'll start after eating dinner and breakfast!

269
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,140
That's what you always talk about!

270
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,120
If I'm not mistaken,
it's in the shape of a bell, right?

271
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,870
A golden bell? How gorgeous!

272
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,540
Alright! We'll get the gold!!

273
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,400
Yeah!!

274
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

275
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,400
"Festival on the Night Before
Gold-Hunting! Feelings for Vearth!"

276
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,700
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
