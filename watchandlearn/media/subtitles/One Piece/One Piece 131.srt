2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,400
"The First Patient!
The Untold Story Of The Rumble Ball"

20
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,050
I... I can't breathe...

21
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,690
Stop it... Lashes...!

22
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,880
Everyone! Wake up! Wake up!

23
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,680
Good morning, Nami-san...

24
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,840
Give me your passionate morning kiss...

25
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,110
You bastard! Don't give me
that disgusting face!

26
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
That's what I wanna say!

27
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,530
--You bastard!
--It's an island! We can see an island!

28
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,020
Huh? An island?

29
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,620
An island!

30
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,690
Where's the island?

31
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,580
Look over there!

32
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,920
Whoa...

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,470
Whoa!

34
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,660
Doesn't this island have monsters?
I prefer big and strong ones.

35
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,290
Don't step on it. Don't step on it.

36
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,330
Don't step on my life...

37
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,170
There doesn't seem to
be anything suspicious,

38
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,040
and it looks like this is a small island, too...

39
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,330
Look, Nami-san!

40
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,510
This is perfect for making
nonperishable food!

41
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,940
It looks like this island has tons of these!

42
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,130
I see...

43
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,850
Seems like it'd be a good idea to
collect them and load them on the ship.

44
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,750
Looks like there're other plants
that can be used for food.

45
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,270
This island seems quite
enjoyable for a cook.

46
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,360
Okay.

47
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,340
Then please go look for things
that can be used for food, Sanji-kun.

48
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,980
The remaining four of you will do this.

49
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,250
Huh?

50
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,060
What is it?

51
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,820
Drawing lots?

52
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,950
The three who draw the shortest lots
will spend all day collecting these.

53
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,200
The one who draws the longest one
will stay here and watch the ship.

54
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,690
Why are you the one giving us orders?

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,120
Right. Normally the captain
would give orders, but...

56
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,320
Oh, hey... they're all short.

57
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,530
Hey, why'd you draw three of them?

58
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,050
Isn't the one who grabs
the most the winner?

59
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,800
Do you think this ship has a
captain who can give orders?

60
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
No, it doesn't.

61
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,070
Am I that great?

62
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,560
Obviously you aren't!

63
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,520
I drew the longest one.
So I'll be watching the ship?

64
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,490
Yes. Please look after the ship, Chopper.

65
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,690
Hurry up! Hurry up! Let's go already!

66
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,420
Let's go get fruits already!

67
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,740
You're coming too, right, Nami?

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,240
No, I'll spend all day today
measuring this island.

69
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,280
I'd like to put it on the sea chart.

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
I can't wait to put my skills in practice!

71
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,420
See you later! Be careful! Have fun!

72
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,630
Look after the ship, okay?!

73
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,970
The one who collects the most will win!

74
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
Hmm... what a pain...

75
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,380
Why do we have to take
orders from that woman?

76
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,480
Now, here I go! Measuring! Measuring!

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,560
Oh... How lively Nami-san is when she's
carrying measuring tools on her back!

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,900
Nami-san! You're lovely!

79
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,900
--Mellorine! Mellorine!
--Stop talking stupid and come already!

80
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,080
I'll be all by myself today.

81
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,050
When no one's around, the ship
looks really big somehow.

82
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,060
Listen, guys!

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,980
I'll be the great
Captain Chopper from today!

84
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,940
Hey, everyone! Look this way!

85
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,450
Luffy! Don't eat others' food!

86
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,200
Usopp! Work harder!

87
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,540
Sanji! Prepare special dishes for me!

88
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,610
Hurray, Captain Chopper! Hurray!

89
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,680
How long have you been there?!

90
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,640
Being so quiet... How sneaky...!

91
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,110
L-Look! I still don't trust you!

92
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,780
You were a Baroque Works Officer Agent.

93
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,150
You were a rogue, and mean, and stupid!

94
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,360
I won't accept you!

95
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
Even if Luffy accepts you as a friend,

96
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,990
there's no way... I'd talk to you!

97
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,690
Her special skill is assassination, right?

98
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,980
I hear she's very smart, too.

99
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,000
I have to be careful.

100
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,540
Ah...

101
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,230
That's right, I went to bed after I
made ten Rumble Balls last night...

102
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,440
I'll spend all day making another ten!

103
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,440
Rumble Balls...

104
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,380
I have to make them when I can,

105
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,610
since you never know when
you'll run into enemies...

106
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,590
But...

107
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,250
...this brings back memories of the
time the Rumble Ball was created...

108
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,420
Doctorine won't notice if these get
reduced little by little, will she?

109
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,560
She always mixes this and this, right?

110
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,260
Hm? Was it this one?

111
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,510
She didn't put this one, did she?

112
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,610
Chopper! Do you know where
my medicine bottles are?

113
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,000
They have important medicine in them.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,940
They're all rare and valuable medicines.

115
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,180
You wouldn't be playing
with them, would you?

116
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,180
Chopper!

117
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,130
I got a good scolding
from Doctorine then...

118
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,150
I wonder how Doctorine is doing now...

119
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,580
Maybe I'll write her a letter.

120
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,690
Hm?

121
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,640
They're called... Rumble Balls?

122
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,990
Are you trying to uncover
the secret of the Rumble Ball

123
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,930
and then assassinate me?!

124
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,770
Not a chance. I won't be taken
down by someone like you!

125
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,990
Rumble...!

126
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,210
Guard Point!

127
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,670
Ow!

128
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,310
Heavy Point!

129
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,640
Jumping Point!

130
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,150
Horn Point!

131
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,850
You see the power of the Rumble Ball?!

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,200
There's more where that came from!

133
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,520
I can see through your weak point!

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,650
Brain Point...! Scope!

135
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,850
Weak point...! Weak point...!
Where's her weak point?!

136
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,180
What's funny?

137
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,620
You don't have to look so fierce, right?

138
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,190
S... Stop it! Stop it! Stop tickling me!

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,840
Stop it!

140
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,940
How cute you are!

141
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,810
I like you.

142
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,510
C... Cute...?

143
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,340
Give me a break! Even if you like me,

144
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,120
that doesn't make me happy or anything!

145
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,730
There's no way I'm happy!

146
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,950
You jerk! You jerk! You jerk...!

147
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,660
Well, then... shall we go?

148
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,360
What?

149
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,700
The water's gone, right?

150
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,160
Ah...

151
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,120
I'd like to drink coffee... before I read.

152
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,080
What's the matter?
You go draw the water...

153
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,290
since you spilt it.

154
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,470
Ah, yes.

155
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,470
Geez... How could I feel like
working on such a fine day?

156
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Whoa! There sure are a lot of them!

157
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,250
Ahh!

158
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,560
He got me!

159
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,810
That time, I thought... "This is it...

160
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,740
This is the end of Captain Usopp...!"

161
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,480
I was attacked by a huge condor...
and I couldn't breathe...

162
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,700
Sorry...

163
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,030
Because of that, I couldn't
get even a single fruit. I'm sorry.

164
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,650
That's okay. Don't worry about me...

165
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,400
Ugh...! I'm dead.

166
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,670
Why do I have to take
orders from that woman?!

167
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,590
Seriously, how irritating!

168
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,130
Three-Sword Style...

169
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,050
...Dragon... Twister!

170
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,820
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

171
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,780
The contour line should be like this...

172
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,560
The right ridgeline is 42 degrees, maybe?

173
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,210
The love fever is also 42 degrees.

174
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,080
Please measure the height of
my feeling towards you, too!

175
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,260
--You're in my way! Move!
--Ow!

176
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,810
I'm the one who's going to draw the water...

177
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,310
Why is she coming, too?

178
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,240
What a fine day!

179
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,160
What?!

180
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,080
S-So what?!

181
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,550
Nothing, really. It's a fine day.

182
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,050
That's all.

183
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,070
I just... wanted to take a walk somehow.

184
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,010
I haven't felt this way for quite a long time.

185
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,500
I was constrained every day
for a long time, so...

186
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,350
I never smiled, either...

187
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,030
Ah!

188
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,730
Hm?

189
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,610
Wow...

190
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,890
Water!

191
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,670
If I remember correctly,

192
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,890
you said you've always been
alone since you were eight.

193
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,970
Yes...

194
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,360
By following pirates, I barely survived...

195
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,240
Tell me... about this Doctorine person...

196
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,200
What?

197
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,530
You were talking about that person earlier.

198
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,200
She's a doctor, right? Is she your teacher?

199
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,060
Y-Yeah,

200
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,970
but Doctorine is someone
whom I'm deeply indebted to.

201
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,160
People call her Dr. Kureha.

202
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,140
Dr. Kureha... What kind of person is she?

203
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,620
She really loves alcohol.

204
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,390
Although she's a woman,
she's like a pirate...

205
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,690
And she's like a pirate, but she is a doctor.

206
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,640
I studied to be a doctor
under Doctorine for six years.

207
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,180
"After mixing these three kinds
of herbs, grind them well"...

208
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,610
Chopper! Chopper!

209
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,460
Urk!

210
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,430
Did you read the medical book?

211
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,000
The 500 pages that I told you to read?

212
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,620
Humph! You were playing
with the medicine again?

213
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,380
I wasn't playing!

214
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,430
That's the same as playing.

215
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,060
B-But...

216
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,920
But what?

217
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,060
I... I've been studying for three years now.

218
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,680
I've also read 200 medical books.

219
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,770
Let me compound the medicine...

220
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,240
It's still 100 years too early!

221
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,200
I-I've memorized all 200
books that I read! It's true!

222
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,050
I even memorized "The Seventh
Principle" by Dr. Alexandra,

223
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,420
which you said was the most difficult!

224
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,150
The TaboTabo bacteria start
dividing on the 7th day of culturing.

225
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,500
After showing the sign of overreaction

226
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,390
mentioned on page 1,254,
chapter 7, section 2...

227
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,720
Humph... So... wha...

228
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,770
Doctorine!

229
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,980
Are you okay?

230
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,660
Looks like I got a febrile disease
from the patient I saw the other day...

231
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,950
This is a terrible fever!

232
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,150
Chopper, if you talk big like that,
try putting your medical skill to the test.

233
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,410
What?

234
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,380
I'll be your first patient.

235
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,300
I won't give you any advice.

236
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,690
If you fail, I'll die...

237
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,620
Learn by experience that
medicine is a serious challenge

238
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,470
where patients' lives are at stake.

239
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,030
Will the blue-nose reindeer be
able to win in a serious challenge?

240
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,210
There's no mistake! This is
the pathogen of the Mondolin.

241
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,920
What works for this
pathogen is... let's see...

242
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,670
This is it!

243
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,350
Doctorine...

244
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,310
Don't die... Please...

245
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,410
Let's see...

246
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,440
You're not gonna ask what
medicine I compounded?

247
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,170
You think there're patients out there
who'd have enough composure

248
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,450
to ask doctors questions about everything?

249
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,420
If patients don't trust their doctors,
they won't recover from the sickness.

250
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,880
How is it? Do you feel a little better?

251
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,340
You dummy. No medicine
would work that quick.

252
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,830
Let me sleep a little.

253
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,780
Chopper!

254
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,490
Not too bad, considering
your lack of experience...

255
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,710
It was the first time that
Doctorine praised me.

256
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,910
It was the only time during those six years.

257
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,430
Instead of acknowledging me,
she left her life in my hands.

258
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,390
That's Doctorine.
That's the kind of person she is.

259
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,100
I won't forget...

260
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,100
Some day, I'll become a
doctor that'll surprise even her.

261
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,650
Oh, no... I said too much...

262
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,360
Huh?!

263
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,190
We'd better get going or the sun will set...

264
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,160
I wish I had someone that
I could write a letter to...

265
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,120
like you do...

266
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,630
What...? Ah!

267
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,950
This is heavy...

268
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,900
Heavy...

269
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,110
So... why weren't you able
to get even a single fruit?!

270
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,740
That's a good question...

271
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,010
That time, I thought...

272
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,570
A huge king condor attacked me...!

273
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,640
Sorry, everyone...

274
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,980
I tried risking my life to get fruits,

275
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,800
but I couldn't... I'm dead.

276
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,550
On the contrary, Zoro did a great job!

277
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,360
Keep up that momentum and stay
up all night tonight to get more!

278
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,970
Oh... How lovely Nami-san is, even
when she efficiently gives orders...!

279
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,060
Shut up! You lecher cook!

280
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,020
Wanna fight?! Moss Head!

281
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,360
I was just kidding.

282
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,450
But hey, today was the first
peaceful day in a while!

283
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,910
What about you? What did you
do all day today on the ship?

284
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,660
Me? Nothing special...

285
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,620
But it was a pretty good day.

286
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,460
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

287
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:33,410
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

288
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:39,630
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

289
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:45,090
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

290
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,310
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

291
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:56,770
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

292
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,470
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

293
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,280
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

294
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,540
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

295
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,500
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

296
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,540
A never-ending journey to be together

297
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,940
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

298
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,980
Say, Sanji-kun... Please!

299
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,510
There's something I want
you to buy for me.

300
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,430
Anything for you... Uhm...
these papers cost 4.8 million Berries!

301
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,090
Well, I wouldn't have that
much money, though...

302
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,100
Don't be so cold.

303
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,760
That's right. We do have money.

304
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,980
Oh, yeah. In exchange for this
guy with a bounty on his head...

305
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,770
What?!

306
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,820
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,540
"Uprising of the Navigator!
For the Unyielding Dream!"

308
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
