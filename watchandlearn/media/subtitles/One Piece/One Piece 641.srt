00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,640
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,190
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,410
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,380
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

77
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,860
was the Flare-Flare Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,440
Meanwhile, Robin and Usopp arrived at Green Bit
to hand Caesar over

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,680
and came across little people in the forest.

80
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,500
Mil Fleurs! Campo de Flores!

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,990
I caught one!

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,620
Huh?! What did you catch?!

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,490
I think it's a little person!

84
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,070
At the same time,
to grant the girl

85
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,910
that he met on the street, Violet's, wish,

86
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,650
Sanji made a raid on an
unknown villain's hide-out

87
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,970
and got caught in a trap.

88
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,560
You're a good-for-nothing,
"Black Foot" Sanji!

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,980
Did you really think that
a guy like you could win my heart?

90
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,680
How funny.

91
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,250
You're lying, Violet-chan...

92
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,280
I'm thinking about you.

93
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,390
The way you looked at me
at that moment...

94
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,980
I knew you were telling the truth!

95
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,090
It doesn't matter
if a million people accuse you, I...

96
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,810
I believe in women's tears!

97
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,570
"The Unknown World!
The Tontatta Kingdom!"

98
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,870
"Believe in women's tears"? How absurd!

99
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,110
He must've gone crazy in fear of death!

100
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,970
Face reality!

101
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,350
You were completely fooled by Sis' act!

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,990
What a shithead!

103
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Sis, if this pervert is useless to us now,

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,920
let's just kill him already!

105
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,290
We got her permission!

106
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,290
He's worth 77 million berries!

107
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,400
A member of the Straw Hats! "Black Foot" Sanji!

108
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,730
Let's cut his head off!

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,170
Hierro Lágrima!

110
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,340
Whoa! Sis, what're you doing?!

111
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,700
Eye Whale!

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,380
Help!

113
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,140
Violet-chan?

114
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,260
Eye Whale!

115
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,060
Violet-chan, you were working for

116
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,880
Doflamingo against your will, weren't you?!

117
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,890
Run, Black Foot.

118
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,790
Violet-chan, what about you?!

119
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,560
Forget about me!

120
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,160
Why?!

121
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,460
We know

122
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,500
what you people have
been doing all along.

123
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,280
What?

124
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,600
I was your enemy
but you kept believing in me!

125
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,290
You sure are a good-for-nothing!

126
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,020
Thank you for what you've said.

127
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,160
It made me happy!

128
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,440
I don't know why but

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,860
you don't wanna work for Doflamingo, do you?!

130
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,980
You even fought your own men!

131
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,130
Let's escape from this island together on our ship!

132
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,370
Look at me, Black Foot!

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,800
From the moment
you all arrived here with Caesar,

134
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,970
you were walking into that man's trap!

135
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,800
Trap?

136
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,180
Yes. Look inside my head.

137
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,220
How can I do that?

138
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,620
What you see is Dressrosa this morning.

139
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,740
What does this mean?

140
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,820
What?

141
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,040
What the...

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,980
THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

143
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,520
So the winner of Block A was Burgess!

144
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,330
The winner of Block B was Bartolomeo!

145
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,680
And the match of Block C is about to start!

146
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,630
Who is going to win this one?!

147
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,910
All competitors seem eager to start!

148
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,020
Alright! It's time finally!

149
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,470
What is it?

150
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,340
A bull?!

151
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,360
Are you gonna fight, too?!

152
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,690
How funny! You're all fired up!

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,100
Hey, who's forcing his way in?!

154
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,260
Stop pushing, idiot!

155
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,760
It's not me, shithead!

156
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,640
Whoa!

157
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,120
Isn't it starting yet?!

158
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,340
Hey, an old geezer like you should stay back!

159
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
What did you say?

160
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,310
Say it again!

161
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,500
I said "Your grandpa is an old geezer"!

162
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,350
Whoa-whoa, brother, relax.

163
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,020
That's enough, squirt.

164
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,770
We will show you

165
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,020
what we are capable of in the match!

166
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,450
What did you say?!
Don't mess with us Funk Brothers!

167
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,170
Thank you for waiting!

168
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,640
The time has come!
The competitors of Block C are...

169
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,180
...entering!

170
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,220
The competitors are coming
in one after another!

171
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,120
Just like Block B,

172
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,960
Block C has many formidable contenders!

173
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,840
The battle will start soon!

174
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,880
Who is going to win...

175
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,020
...Portgas D. Ace's Flare-Flare Fruit?!

176
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,510
Until the day you are filled with happiness,

177
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,060
I will always be by your side!

178
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,080
Was it a dream?

179
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,020
Wait! Monkey-san!

180
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,340
I got you!

181
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,000
Again! What kind of place
is the Flower Field?!

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,680
Be quiet and keep running.
I'll tell you later.

183
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,010
Watch out for the police!

184
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,780
Aren't you a soldier?!
Don't be scared of the police!

185
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,350
Soldier-san!

186
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,090
Soldier-san!

187
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,290
What the hell? Do you know her?

188
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,460
Rebecca.

189
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,790
I saw the list in the Colosseum.

190
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,770
You entered the competition as I thought.

191
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,140
I told you not to!

192
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,350
I...

193
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,950
I'll do it! I'll win it!

194
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,450
Soldier-san!

195
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,220
So...

196
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,730
So... Hey, can we live together?!

197
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,930
A warrior who cries easily can't win
a competition!

198
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,220
Hey, let's go!

199
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,010
Is it okay?

200
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,940
Yes.

201
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,000
Just go!

202
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,320
Is it really okay?! That girl was crying!

203
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,460
That's why we got to hurry!

204
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,240
I'm just a toy but I have something
that I want to protect!

205
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,380
But I can't even shed
tears from these tin eyes.

206
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,050
THE FOREST OF GREEN BIT

207
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,450
Hey, Robin, what's going on?!

208
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,380
You said there was a little person!

209
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,910
Yes, I have him here.

210
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,660
Huh? That's not even funny!

211
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,280
Nobody's out there, right? It's all safe?

212
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,970
Did you rob those Navy soldiers?

213
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,690
This is no good!
We have to do something!

214
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,620
There is no little person...

215
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,700
Wow, there is one!

216
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,760
I think his friends are still around here.

217
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,940
What?!

218
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,000
I heard someone talking.

219
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,080
Anesthetic flowers!

220
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,320
What's this smoke?

221
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,220
Hey, are you alright? Robi... n...

222
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,740
Tired...

223
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,300
Usopp...

224
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,520
She's gonna fall asleep soon.

225
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,540
What should we do with these people?

226
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,580
Since they saw us,

227
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,970
we must get rid of them!

228
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,190
What's in her bag?

229
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,040
A book, a notebook, and clothes.

230
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,380
--A candy.
--A Transponder Snail.

231
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,750
Make sure to take all weapons.

232
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,720
There must be something on her!

233
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,190
We are searching her clothes!

234
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,730
--Nothing around Point C.
--Roger.

235
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,140
--Nothing around Point A.
--Roger.

236
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,840
She's not hiding anything
around Point B, either.

237
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,890
The Big Human is waking up!

238
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,590
Go on the alert!

239
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,760
Okay!

240
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,850
W-Wait a minute! Ouch!

241
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,800
Don't try to run! Stay calm!

242
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,610
My body is pinned to the ground!

243
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,590
It's no use trying to move!

244
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,460
I sewed your body onto the ground

245
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,410
with my magical Stitch-Stitch power!

246
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,380
Stitch-Stitch power?

247
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,140
Yes! I sewed you up with this needle!

248
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,780
You're a villainous Big Human, aren't you?

249
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,800
I'm sorry but I think there
is a misunderstanding.

250
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,660
Are you a Devil Fruit eater?

251
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,270
I'm a Tontatta Tribe warrior - Leo!

252
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,140
A WARRIOR - LEO
THE TONTATTA TRIBE
(A TRIBE OF LITTLE PEOPLE)

253
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,590
Leo-san. Where am I?

254
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,100
Where is Usopp?

255
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,240
I mean, the other human - he's not here?

256
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,660
Is he okay?

257
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,710
We also captured that long-nosed Big Human

258
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,980
in accordance with our kingdom's rules.

259
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,180
So this is you Little People's kingdom.

260
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,610
Indeed, you're in the Tontatta Kingdom

261
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,000
underneath the great forest that we created.

262
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,830
The forest? You mean Green Bit?

263
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,230
Did you people grow all those giant plants?!

264
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,300
Yes! There is no plant that we can't grow!

265
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,300
Watch out, everybody!

266
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,320
Kabu-san!

267
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,810
This Big Human can sprout flower-like hands
on the ground!

268
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,320
Flower-like hands?!

269
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,710
We've never grown such things!

270
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,090
Yes, it must be a magic!
The strangest thing I've ever seen!

271
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,300
There was no time to run
before she caught me!

272
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,390
That's right!

273
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,860
I got hypnotized by something
and they must've carried me here!

274
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,360
I can maybe get away from here with my power

275
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,370
but it can create a stir.

276
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,140
You Big Human! What are you up to?!

277
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,420
Are you here to destroy the Tontatta Kingdom?!

278
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,290
No! I'm sorry!
I just caught him out of curiosity!

279
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,490
Whatever the reason is,

280
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:10,130
we can't let anybody who
saw us Tontatta Tribe go alive.

281
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,020
Why?! I wasn't going to hurt any
of you people in the first place

282
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,940
and I'll never tell anyone that I saw you!

283
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,100
Don't lie!

284
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,670
I don't wanna hear your excuses!

285
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,900
I mean it!

286
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,740
What?

287
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,880
Then, I'll let you go!

288
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,220
What?!

289
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,890
--Oh, what a relief!

290
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,450
I thought she was a bad person.

291
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,340
Great!

292
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,390
They believed me!

293
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,500
Why are they so credulous?

294
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,420
You're free now!

295
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,030
Here are your glasses.

296
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,290
Thank you.

297
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,970
Hey, Leo!

298
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,570
Tonta-chief-sama!

299
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,020
What are you doing?

300
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,120
Tonta-chief-sama, she is a good person!

301
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,160
No way!

302
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,010
But she said so herself.

303
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,880
What?!

304
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,120
Okay, then.

305
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,690
Again?!
Everybody here is so credulous?!

306
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,040
Hmmm, we don't often have a chance to
stare at a Big Human like this.

307
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,830
Who are you?

308
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,820
My name is Gancho.

309
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,730
I'm the Tonta-chief, the king

310
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,720
GANCHO
THE TONTA-CHIEF (THE KING)
OF THE TONTATTA KINGDOM

311
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,730
of the Tontatta Kingdom.

312
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,740
You can stay as long as you like.

313
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,130
Hey! Hello!

314
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,370
Do you want to eat some simmered pumpkins?

315
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,110
Ah!

316
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,170
Thank you! But I don't have time.

317
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,980
Here, here!

318
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,590
Our tree sap cookies are delicious!

319
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,750
Why don't you have tea with us?

320
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,990
I'm sorry. I have to go.

321
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,710
Do you want some grilled mushrooms?

322
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,660
Where is my Transponder Snail?

323
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,360
Oh!

324
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,040
I released it into the wild!

325
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,740
Oh no! There is not much time until three!

326
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,670
I have to call Law!

327
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,810
Where can I get out?

328
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,510
I must go!

329
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,670
Wait! Are you leaving?

330
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,010
I thought that you were a good person!

331
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,790
If you're a good person, give us your weapon!

332
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,920
That's the rule!

333
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,350
But I...

334
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,920
If you don't give it to us,
we're gonna strip you of all you have!

335
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,760
But I don't have any weapon!

336
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,760
Then we have no choice.

337
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,180
We're gonna strip you of all you have!

338
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,210
Take everything she has!

339
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,760
My sunglasses!

340
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,910
They're gone!

341
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,170
Go!

342
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,360
No! Wait a minute!

343
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,850
What's the matter?

344
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,160
That Big Human is...

345
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,100
...the hero's partner!

346
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,700
What?!

347
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,670
Th-The hero?!

348
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,840
Usopp?

349
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,640
Who is the hero that you're talking about?

350
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm talking about the other Big Human
that we captured earlier.

351
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,650
He came to save us!

352
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,520
He's the legendary... legendary...

353
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,520
He's the legendary hero!

354
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,140
That's good!

355
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,140
--Awesome!
--I wanna see him!

356
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,130
Usopp... What did he tell them?

357
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,600
It's two fifty-seven.

358
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,550
We don't have time!

359
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,270
The appointed time for Caesar's hand-over
from Law to Doflamingo is...

360
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,030
...in...

361
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,750
...two minutes.

362
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,810
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

363
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,130
Ring, ring, ring... Ring,
ring, ring... Clank!

364
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,230
Hey, Law! This is Sanji!

365
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,120
Black Foot-ya! Did you find the factory?

366
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,800
That's not important now!

367
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,880
What's wrong?

368
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,240
Listen carefully!
You've got to get out of there!
