2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,900
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,630
Luffy made a raid on the Navy HQ to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,610
But his struggle ended in vain

62
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,680
and the historic War of the
Best in Marineford has ended.

63
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:59,210
However, 10 years ago, in the East Blue...

64
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,880
Luffy, this is Ace.

65
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,760
You're gonna live here with them from today.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,470
Take me with you! Let's become friends!

67
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,860
It's the end of the forest.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,230
"Here Comes Sabo! The Boy
at the Gray Terminal!"

69
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,400
I can't believe we earned this much!

70
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,140
Porchemy-san was right!

71
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:59,150
That greedy merchant begged for it when we
said that it was treasure from the Grand Line!

72
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,830
In fact, it was just junk that
we found washed up on the shore!

73
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,350
We were lucky that he was just a
coward who has never gone to sea!

74
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,290
Well, we've never been to sea, either!

75
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,340
Wow! What is this place?

76
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,060
There is a place like this on the North side
of Mt. Corvo where the Dadan family lives.

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,230
It is a smoky pile of discarded junk.

78
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,690
Unwanted things ended up here.

79
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,200
And here live rogues who were
shunned from mainstream society.

80
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,080
Unsurprisingly, it's a lawless area.

81
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,030
Crime and disease abound
since there are no doctors.

82
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,960
This place is called Gray Terminal.

83
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,160
Ace!

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,010
What's that?

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
He's not here.

86
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey! Where did you go?!

87
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
Ace!

88
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,800
Ace!

89
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,650
It's afternoon already.

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,630
Treasure, treasure! Is there
anything valuable here?

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,030
Here's something!

92
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,610
--Give it to me!
--That's mine!

93
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,570
Stop it! I found it!

94
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,070
Don't touch it, you fools!

95
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,580
Let me cash it in for you!

96
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,370
--You can't have it!
--Stop!

97
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,880
--Damn you!
--Give it to me!

98
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,650
You wouldn't have gotten hurt
if you'd just given it to me!

99
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,520
Thank you very much!

100
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,150
You asshole!

101
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,360
Thief!

102
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,320
Outta my way, brat!

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,450
Hurry up! Or I'm gonna...

104
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,700
He went that way!

105
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,110
"THE FOREST IN-BETWEEN"
MT COLVO AND GRAY TERMINAL

106
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,450
Sabo! Sabo, are you there?!

107
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,920
Oh, Ace!

108
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,630
Sorry I'm late.

109
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,050
You sure are.

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,570
I've already done some work in the city.

111
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,180
SABO [10 YEARS OLD] (A BOY WHO
LIVES IN THE GRAY TERMINAL)

112
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,100
Oh yeah? Well, I did, too.

113
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,890
At once!

114
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,770
Whoa! You got a lot! Way more than I did!

115
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,770
That's a lot of money! How'd you get that?

116
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,280
I robbed some thugs near the main gate!

117
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,280
Damn! You won again!

118
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,420
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.

119
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,520
It's been 5 years since we started
to put money in our "pirate savings".

120
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,060
We worked hard for it.

121
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,590
Yes, we did.

122
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,380
We're gonna leave the East Blue and go
somewhere these people have never dreamed of.

123
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,790
It's exciting just to think about it!

124
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,400
Now put it away. We can't
let anybody to see it.

125
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,860
I wonder how much we need
to get a pirate ship.

126
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,820
I don't know. 10 million
or 100 million maybe?

127
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,410
Long way to go.

128
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,660
"A pirate ship"?!

129
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,250
You guys! Are you gonna become pirates?!

130
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,920
I'm gonna become one, too!

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,550
--Be quiet!
--Be quiet!

132
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,600
Ace! I didn't know that you
travel this far everyday!

133
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,730
Shut up!

134
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,560
Is this the Luffy that
you were talking about?

135
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,190
Oh, you told him about me?!

136
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,740
I told him how annoying you are.

137
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,690
He also told me that you're empty-headed.

138
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh yeah?

139
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,620
You don't realize that
we're dissing you, do you?

140
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,420
He finally got me here although I
didn't take any walkable routes.

141
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,880
Are you a friend of Ace's?
Be my friend, too, buddy!

142
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,510
Shut up! You can't call me "buddy"!

143
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,140
--Then what's your name?
--Sa...

144
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,850
I'm not telling you!

145
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,240
This is why I told you to live here with me!

146
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,650
The daily round trip--training on the
mountain road turned out to be bad!

147
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,150
What should we do?

148
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,480
He found our secret. He's gonna
tell somebody if nothing is done.

149
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
We gotta kill him.

150
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,120
Alright, let's do it.

151
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,290
What?!

152
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,760
Don't kill me!! Help me!! I don't wanna die!!

153
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
Shut up, you fool!

154
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,100
Sabo, kill him already!

155
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
What?! You do it!

156
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,740
I've never killed anybody before!

157
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,350
Me, neither! And I don't know how!

158
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,310
Don't throw me into water!!

159
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,230
--Okay, let's head to the river!
--Why did he tell us that?

160
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,240
He's stupid!

161
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,780
Help me!!

162
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,370
--Shut up!
--Shut up!

163
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,830
I don't wanna die!

164
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,580
I hear a voice from the forest!

165
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,750
A kid's voice!

166
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh no! Somebody's coming!

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,210
Set him free for now!

168
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,090
We gotta move from
here or they're gonna find our treasure!

169
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,470
Everybody knows those kids
around here. Ace and Sabo.

170
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,230
CREW MEMBER OF THE BLUEJAM PIRATES PORCHEMY

171
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,230
Are you sure that it was
Ace who took the money?

172
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,350
Yes. We're sorry. We shouldn't
let our guard down.

173
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,900
How outrageous that kid is!
He can't just steal our money!

174
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,530
If Captain Bluejam finds out about
this, he's gonna kill all of us!

175
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,100
Dammit! I didn't know that those
thugs were working for Bluejam!

176
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,000
You mean that you stole the money from them?

177
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,500
I shouldn't have taken that money...

178
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,550
He has a real sword. That's
Porchemy who works under Bluejam.

179
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,300
He's crazy. Did you know that?

180
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,230
He strips off your scalp alive
after you lose a fight with him!

181
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,290
Let's just let them pass for now...

182
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,240
Oh? Where is he?

183
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,080
--Let me go! What do you want from me?
--How could you get caught?

184
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,290
Let me go! You bastard!

185
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,620
Who is this little shit?

186
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,290
Help me! Ace!!

187
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,760
Help me, Ace!!

188
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,010
--That fool! He's calling my name!
--Help me! Ace!!

189
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,110
Did you just call for "Ace"?

190
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,240
So what?!

191
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,910
Do you know Ace?

192
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,950
I'm his friend!

193
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,210
Oh, but he just tried to kill me.

194
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,750
That fool! He's such a big mouth!

195
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,360
I don't know if you know about this but

196
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,470
I heard that Ace stole some
money from us and ran today.

197
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,720
You don't know where is it now, do you?

198
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,350
Oh no! They're gonna take
all our treasure away!

199
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,690
I hope that fool doesn't tell them!

200
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,830
So? What do you say?

201
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,460
--What?!
--Huh?!

202
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,350
I-I don't know...

203
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,960
A terrible liar!

204
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,140
Alright, alright! It can't be
helped that you don't know.

205
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,900
Don't worry, I'll help you
bring back the memory!

206
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,190
What are you doing?! Let me
go! Where are you taking me?!

207
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,900
Dammit! Stupid! Let me go!

208
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,370
You bastard! Let me go! What
are you doing, bastard?!

209
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,660
What should we do?!

210
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,340
You know what we have to do...

211
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,510
Let me go!

212
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm not gonna tell you anything!

213
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,690
You little shit!

214
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,410
I told you that my body turned to
rubber after I ate the Gum-Gum Fruit!

215
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,290
Shut up!

216
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,460
The Devil Fruit, eh?

217
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,230
Looks like you had the real one.

218
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,330
Get me a pair of gloves.

219
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,680
Y-Yes, sir!

220
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,300
Hurry up, hurry up! We're
screwed if they come back!

221
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,240
We gotta move our treasure somewhere else!

222
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,270
It's a matter of time
before Luffy tells them!

223
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,650
They'll take not only what we stole from them

224
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,860
but all of our "pirate savings" that
we've spent 5 years collecting!

225
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,450
Listen, you little shit.

226
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,040
The money that your friend Ace stole
is very important to our pirate crew.

227
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,340
And you know where it is.

228
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,960
So I need you to tell us.

229
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,640
No!

230
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,730
It worked!

231
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,860
You don't wanna make a pirate mad!

232
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,990
Our captain Bluejam is very brutal!

233
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,080
It hurts! I'm scared!

234
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,710
Help me!!

235
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,510
Guys, go look for Ace and Sabo! We
don't have time to stand around!

236
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,920
Y-Yes, sir!

237
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,980
You're asking me if I know Ace and Sabo?

238
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,040
You guys must be hooligans from the city.

239
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,690
You don't wanna mess with those two.

240
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,450
They're kids but you
can't underestimate them.

241
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,240
They're like mad dogs
that'd kill even a tiger.

242
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,560
Ace and Sabo? I haven't
seen them for a while.

243
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:30,360
Anyway, young men, why don't you
leave everything valuable here?

244
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,280
--C-Come on, man!
--We'll ask someone else!

245
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,130
They still don't know where we are?

246
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,770
I thought that they'd know by now...

247
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,720
Oh no!

248
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,270
I didn't realize that it's almost night.

249
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,980
Yes! It's finished!

250
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,320
We moved all the treasure!

251
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,490
What's wrong with that kid?

252
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,120
Ace!

253
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,000
Sabo! What's wrong? Have they
shown up to look for the money?

254
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,210
No, they haven't!

255
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,090
And I bet they won't!

256
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,360
What do you mean?

257
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,260
That kid, Luffy...

258
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,600
He hasn't told them anything!

259
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,230
I'm sure that they're torturing him!

260
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,440
I thought that he'd just tell them
because he's dumb and cries so much!

261
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,150
It doesn't make sense!

262
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,720
If nothing is done, he'll...

263
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,170
GRAY TERMINAL "THE COVE OF PIRATES"

264
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,170
It's so late!

265
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,790
Who is in charge today?

266
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,840
It's Porchemy, Captain Bluejam.

267
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,800
It's almost sunset.

268
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,210
I'm sure that they've already
cashed it in by now.

269
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,900
CAPTAIN OF THE BLUEJAM PIRATES BLUEJAM

270
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,190
Maybe he's running away with the money.

271
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,490
No way! I don't think that he would risk
getting killed trying something like that!

272
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,950
I don't think so, either!

273
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,790
Spit it out already!

274
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,340
P-P-P-Porchemy-san!
It's no use doing it anymore!

275
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,100
He doesn't have the energy
to even scream now!

276
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:59,600
I bet he won't say anything and to be
honest, I can't stand watching it--it's too cruel!

277
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,320
Show some mercy!

278
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,780
Look for Ace and Sabo if you
have time to speak for the kid!

279
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,160
We're the ones that are in danger
of death! Can't you see?!

280
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,790
We're already too late to give
that money to Captain Bluejam!

281
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,520
How could they do that to the little
kid? Should we call sheriff in the city?

282
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,850
It's no use. This area is not
covered by the country's law.

283
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,080
Plus, he's a member of the Bluejam Pirates.

284
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,400
And they're paying money to the Nobles.

285
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,400
They'll be overlooked for any crime and
murder they commit in this country.

286
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,870
One more dead body will draw
no one's attention here.

287
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,080
Answer me!

288
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,700
I won't say it.

289
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,420
You little shit! Stop trying to
keep a secret like a grown-up!

290
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,720
Say it!!

291
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,850
I won't say it!

292
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,010
I won't say it!

293
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,310
I won't say it!

294
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,810
I won't say it!!

295
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,700
Fine. Enough.

296
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,010
Then you die.

297
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,990
Don't!

298
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,590
Ace and Sabo raid Porchemy's hideout to save the captured Luffy.

299
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,890
Despite the overwhelming strength of the pirates,

300
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,890
Sabo finds a moment's opportunity to free Luffy and makes a run for it,

301
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,440
when Ace shares a surprising resolution...

302
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,920
On the next episode of One Piece!

303
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,190
"I Won't Run! Ace's Desperate
Rescue Operation!"

304
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
