2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,060
The public execution of Ace is in 4 and a
half hours and Luffy has gotten to level 1

50
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,130
and was about to get out of Impel Down
but Warden Magellan caught up with him,

51
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,000
so he has been held up!

52
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,340
What is going on here?!

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,340
There's no Navy ship at all!

54
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,100
Take a good look!

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,640
You can see shadows of
sails slightly in the fog!

56
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,160
There they are! Crowds of Navy ships!

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,810
I'm going to launch you
onto the deck! Hold tight!

58
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,430
Huh? W-What?! What did
you just say, fish face?!

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,530
Oh? That bastard's gone!

60
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,110
Ugh! What's going on here?!

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,290
Ocean Current...

62
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,040
...Shoulder Throw!

63
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,400
They're trying to hijack the
ship! Stop them at any cost!

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,640
We can just throw those Devil
Fruit eaters off into the water!

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,830
"The Escapee Team in Trouble! The
Forbidden Move: Venom Demon!"

66
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
Hey.

67
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,110
You're gonna throw who into the water?

68
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,740
You don't know your limits.

69
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,780
Don't be scared! Throw them overboard!

70
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,590
What the...

71
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,430
Jimbei!

72
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,430
Fish-Man Karate!

73
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,690
Spear Wave!

74
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,500
Hey, man...

75
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,090
Oops, I shouldn't have done that.

76
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,800
We were gonna use that boat!

77
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,930
Gum-Gum...

78
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,260
Hydra!

79
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,730
...Champion...

80
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,480
...Gatling!

81
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,810
How's that?!

82
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,030
Yes! Just one more push!

83
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,410
Take this, bastard!

84
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,100
It's no use stalling for time!

85
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,200
I've told all ships to
take off from Impel Down!

86
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,320
There are no ships left for you to steal!

87
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,620
The old Fish-Man and others went to get
one!

88
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,430
I know that they will find a way!

89
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,020
You're talking about Jimbei?

90
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,670
Then
I should end this all the faster!

91
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,650
Gum-Gum...

92
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,030
No no! Run, Straw Hat!

93
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,330
...Champion...

94
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,540
...Stamp!

95
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,580
You pushed it too far! The
wax won't work anymore!

96
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,470
Wax-Wax...

97
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,300
...Release!

98
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,930
That was close!

99
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,890
Venom...

100
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,970
...Demon!

101
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,620
--We better run!
--Hurry up!

102
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,260
Hell's Judgement!

103
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,310
Damn!

104
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,980
Guys, help me! Let me go with you!

105
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,860
Hey!

106
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,030
Stupid! You can't touch me!

107
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,090
The poison's spreading!

108
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,350
It doesn't matter if it's wax or rock,

109
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,310
the poison is spreading like an infection!

110
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,670
Dammit! No wonder the
Wax-Wax Armor didn't work!

111
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,700
IMPEL DOWN--LEVEL 1 ABOVE WATER
"MAIN ENTRANCE"

112
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,950
I wonder how Straw-chan and others are doing!

113
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,540
--What about the ships?!
--I can hear the sound of gunfire...

114
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,340
...but can't figure out
what's going on in the fog!

115
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,760
I know that they're capable of
stealing a ship for sure but...

116
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,380
But it's too far!

117
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,180
They have to steal it and bring
it all the way back here!

118
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,480
You mean they can't make
it here before Magellan?!

119
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,900
I know that Straw Hat Luffy is strong...

120
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,990
...but I don't think that he can stall
the unbeatable Magellan for that long!

121
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,160
Straw-chan!

122
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,290
Damn! Please hurry, Jimbei!

123
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,130
Throw them off! Don't
let them have this ship!

124
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,180
Damn you!

125
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,860
What's wrong with his body?!
The whole body's like a knife!

126
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,030
I ate the Dice-Dice Fruit.

127
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,370
I remember him! He's an
assassin from the West Blue...

128
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,120
...named Daz!

129
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,410
Sables!

130
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,770
It's only a matter of time
before they steal that ship!

131
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,980
It'll be a dishonor to the Navy!

132
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,590
--Sink it right away!
--Yes, sir!

133
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,710
Get ready to fire!

134
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,800
There's the column again!

135
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,190
--Dammit! The gunpowder got wet!
--That must be Jimbei!

136
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,980
Shoot him from the other batteries!

137
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,450
Hurry up! Hurry! He's right behind us!

138
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,990
--Jimbei!
--Crocodile!

139
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,870
Captain Buggy!

140
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,260
Hey! Is everybody there?!

141
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,640
I hear Straw-chan!

142
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,560
You gotta run!

143
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,610
They're being chased by something horrible!

144
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,240
It's Magellan! We have nowhere to go!

145
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,530
Did you get a ship?!

146
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,830
Straw-chan! I'm afraid that
we don't have a ship yet!

147
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,830
What?!

148
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,840
I've injected some hormones and
managed to walk a little bit...

149
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,020
But I have had it...

150
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,450
Hell Wink!

151
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,130
Ivan-chan?!

152
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,500
You scared us!

153
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,700
I-It seems like I made it in time! Thud!

154
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,370
He passed out from hitting his head!

155
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,660
Ivan-san! Inazuma! You both are alive!

156
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,250
--I'm so glad!
--Ivan-sama!

157
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,630
Those two!

158
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,090
Straw Hat! It's from Jimbei!

159
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,930
The Baby Transponder Snail?!

160
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,160
Good job, you guys!

161
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Why did you even come?

162
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,030
--Clank!
--Luffy-kun, you got out?!

163
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,690
Yeah, but he's still chasing us!

164
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,610
And we're running out of places to run!

165
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,650
Sorry! We got a ship but...

166
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,200
...it'll take some time to get there!

167
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,280
Don't stop! Just jump into the water!

168
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,450
Throw everyone off into the water as well!

169
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,130
What're you saying, Jimbei?!
This is the Calm Belt!

170
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,500
You can leave the rest up to me!

171
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,550
--Let's do as he says!
--What?!

172
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,380
San, help me again!

173
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,560
Are you nuts?! If we dive into
the water, we're gonna die!

174
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,390
He's a minion of the Government

175
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,390
and we can't trust him! Damn Fish-Man!

176
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,060
He's a friend of Ace! I trust him!

177
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,840
Into the water?! Go ahead and dive if you
want!

178
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,700
There are Sea Kings' nests everywhere!

179
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,410
Be careful! You can't touch
even a drop of his poison!

180
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,330
--That's impossible!
--We're gonna die!

181
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,710
What should we do?!

182
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,010
Hell's Judgement!

183
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,960
Third Gear!

184
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:30,820
Here's an oversized treat! Candle Wall!

185
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,940
It's no use!

186
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,030
Straw Hat! Hurry up!

187
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,040
I can't hold it any longer!

188
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,370
Gum-Gum...

189
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,500
...Giant Stamp!

190
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,240
Wow! He pushed it back!

191
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,870
The poison keeps spreading!

192
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,590
Should we dive into the water?!

193
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,720
Here it comes!

194
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,470
Ivan-chan! Ivan-chan, wake up!

195
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,530
We're in trouble! Ivan-chan! Wake up!

196
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,090
Hey, you gotta wake up now!

197
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,970
--What do you want?
--We got to hurry!

198
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,650
--Who are you? Straw boy's son?
--Can you do the wink?!

199
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,930
Okay!

200
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,700
No way! If you do that, we're gonna...

201
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,030
Here you go!

202
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,070
Wait a minute, Ivan-sama!

203
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,640
That's unthinkable to me!

204
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,790
There's no way to survive by diving
into the water without a ship!

205
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,210
--Everybody, hold onto the face!
--The face?!

206
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,380
But I'm not gonna let you get away!

207
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,470
--Hurry up!
--Hold onto Ivan-sama!

208
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,930
I won't allow anyone to
escape from Impel Down!

209
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,350
Hell...

210
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,890
...Wink!

211
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,020
I won't!

212
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,050
We're gonna fall!

213
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,930
Something's under the ship!

214
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,430
What are they?!

215
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,460
Fly, Ivankov!

216
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,850
It's impossible! He's losing consciousness!

217
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,570
What's this?!

218
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,760
We landed on something!

219
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,280
Hey, look!

220
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,990
What's this?!

221
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,350
You made it!

222
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,960
I'm sorry that I should ask you
to come to this dangerous area!

223
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,070
--It's a school of whale sharks!
--Jimbei must have called them!

224
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,040
Cool!

225
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,210
Luffy and the others have at last escaped Impel Down.

226
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,300
However, there isn't any time for celebration.

227
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,250
The Gate of Justice stands in their way,
and the Navy is hot on their tails.

228
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,130
Just when it seems like all hope is lost,

229
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,060
a friend makes the ultimate sacrifice!

230
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,590
On the next episode of One Piece!

231
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,150
"Come, Final Miracle! Break
Through the Gate of Justice!"

232
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
