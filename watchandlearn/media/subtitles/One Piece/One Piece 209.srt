2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,340
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,900
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,870
Now's the time to set
sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,340
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,360
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,620
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,330
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,620
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,800
One Piece

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,730
"Round 1! One Lap of the Donut Race"

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,400
Sheesh!

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,990
You've gotten us into a real mess, Luffy!

26
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,830
All we gotta do is win!

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,540
Hey! You forgot somethin'!

28
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,860
Write down your rosters and
give them to our party organizer!

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,600
Members can participate only twice.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,380
Once you've chosen
your roster, it's set in stone!

31
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,510
The events of the contest are...

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,340
A race, a ball game, and a team competition.

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,010
What's this? The race is open to all members,

34
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,390
the ball game is open to three,

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,680
and the team competition is open to five...

36
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,270
All right! I'm gonna do all three!

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,820
The rules say that isn't allowed.

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,490
Hey, what if we lose?

39
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,320
I bet they'll want Captain Usopp...

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,830
No, I bet it'll be me. Because I'm cute...

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,660
I'll now announce the rosters
submitted by both teams!

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,290
First is the Straw Hat team!

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,670
Participating in Round #1's Donut Race is...
the entire Straw Hat crew!

44
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,180
Actually, my "Can't Be in a Race"
disease is kicking in...

45
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,260
I don't wanna do it either,
you know! Just accept it!

46
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,890
Participating in Round #2's Groggy Ring is...

47
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,930
...Roronoa Zoro, Sanji,
and Tony Tony Chopper!

48
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,320
--Don't go slowin' me down!
--That's my line!

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm... gonna try my very... hardest!

50
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,550
Participating in Round #3's
Run Around Roller is...

51
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,570
...Monkey D. Luffy,
Nico Robin, Nami, and Usopp!

52
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,960
Only four people? We're one short.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
That doesn't matter! Let's do it!

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,220
A captain, a swordsman,
a navigator, a sniper,

55
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,300
a cook, a doctor, and an archaeologist, huh?

56
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,300
Well, then. Who shall I take first?

57
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,600
I guess it'd have to be that one!

58
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,310
I really want that member!

59
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,090
All right! It's finally time
for the merciless Davy Back!

60
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,170
The winner gets a feast,
while the loser gets fleeced!

61
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,090
I, Itomimizu, the Foxy
Pirates' party organizer,

62
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,450
will be your commentator
for this competition!

63
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,480
First up is Round #1, the Donut Race!

64
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,520
How shall we team up?

65
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,630
Considering that some of us
have Devil Fruit powers,

66
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,840
maybe we should split into two
teams of three and four people...

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,460
Boats for the Donut Race can only be made

68
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,170
from two oars and three empty barrels!

69
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,430
Use of any other materials
means instant disqualification!

70
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,810
This is a chance for
shipwrights to show their stuff!

71
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,060
Those without empty barrels, come get some!

72
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,020
We'll give 'em to you for free!
We're generous like that!

73
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,610
I'm not sure we can use three barrels
to build a boat for four of us.

74
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,740
Okay, three teams it is.
They'll consist of...

75
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,280
Hey, you! Don't go busting 'em up like that!

76
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,580
Just watch! I'm gonna make an awesome boat!

77
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,200
All right! While everyone's
busy with their boats,

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,600
I'll explain how the race works!

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,430
The course will be one lap
around Long Ring Long Land!

80
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,720
It might sound easy, but it's anything but!

81
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,060
A team is immediately out of
the race should their boat sink!

82
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,850
In addition, all weapons are allowed,

83
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,650
even guns, cannons, explosives,
cutlasses or anything else!

84
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,400
Whoever complains about unfairness
will be shamed as a pirate!

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,780
Managed to finish it...

86
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,790
Time is nearly up! Is everyone ready?

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,700
Oh! The final odds are in!

88
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,500
I'll list them in order of popularity,
starting with the most popular!

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,820
The top spot obviously goes to our idol,

90
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,800
the member of the powerful
Team Foxy: Porche-chan!

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,880
Ooh! Just leave it to me!

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,130
With her is the swordfish fishman
Capote and the star shark Monda!

93
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,230
They're riding in the Cutie Wagon!

94
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,230
This'll be a cinch! You can do it!

95
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,280
Hold on! You're using a fish!

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,240
There's no rule against fish, you know!

97
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,600
Second most popular is...

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,830
Oh! This is unexpected!

99
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,870
The Straw Hat team of Navigator Nami,

100
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,710
Sniper Usopp, and Archeologist Robin!

101
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,460
They'll be riding the Barrel Tiger!

102
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,600
That orange-haired chick is hot!

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,430
I want that dark-haired girl on our crew!

104
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,470
--Don't need that other guy!
--Yeah. Never mind him.

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,280
I see! Looks like the rowdy Foxy Pirates

106
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,250
have a soft spot for cutey-pies!

107
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,310
What lechers!

108
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,350
--Are you sure this won't sink?!
--I already told you...

109
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,860
I'm not a shipwright!

110
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,940
But it still beats those.

111
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,500
This ain't a boat! It's just some scrap wood!

112
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,070
That's okay!

113
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,450
--So you do that the whole time?
--Yep! I just keep running really hard!

114
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,450
It's a miracle they even float...

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,920
Looks like it's up to us if we
don't wanna lose this race...

116
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,590
Third most popular is the Harem Nocturne,

117
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,590
a boat of the beautiful,
by the beautiful, for the beautiful!

118
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,950
In fourth place is the Crab Crane,
a regular in the top ranks!

119
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,810
In fifth and sixth place are
the Swordfish King #1 and #2!

120
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,190
Seventh most popular is the
party-loving Pleasure Boat!

121
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,820
In eighth place is the Duke Special!

122
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,360
Wait! What about our boat?!

123
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,150
Yeah! Mine too!

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,640
Let's see here...

125
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,240
Doctor Chopper and Swordsman
Zoro's Basically Barrels is...

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,710
...third from last!

127
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,210
Not too surprising.

128
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,020
And the It's a Raft...

129
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,880
...wins the booby prize!

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,840
What's that mean?

131
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,890
Means we're second to last.

132
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,180
You mean there's an even worse boat?!

133
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,350
Incidentally, the very last place
goes to the giant boat...

134
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,510
...the Mothership Coaster!

135
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,210
I don't think oars are long
enough for that thing...

136
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,910
How does it even move?

137
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,680
You guys are sharp!

138
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,580
Yup, oars are too short for this boat!
It's filled with seawater, too!

139
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,440
Those guys are dumb!

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,960
How many barrels did they use, anyway?

141
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,720
This thing is just three giant barrels,
all stuck together!

142
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
It ain't breaking any rules!

143
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,260
Okay! All the boats are at the starting line!

144
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,770
I'll be providing commentary during the race

145
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:12,030
from atop Chirp-Chirp, a rare
South Blue Super Sparrow!

146
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,910
Porche-chan!

147
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,450
I hope you sink, nose dude!

148
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,830
Me?!

149
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,230
We have to win now!

150
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,200
Sinking opponents is fair game.

151
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,060
Oh, my. Listen to that crazy talk.

152
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,130
Let 'em talk, Porche-chan.
We'll sink 'em in three minutes!

153
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,360
Right, Monda?!

154
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,720
I'm getting excited!

155
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,010
Do we even have a chance?

156
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,760
Listen up, Usopp! Anything happens
to the ladies and I'll filet you!

157
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,680
We will win!

158
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,400
Fool! No one's ever beat us
in an orthodox-rules game!

159
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,900
Think this race will last
five minutes, Hamburg?

160
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,990
Nope.

161
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,000
Now take these Eternal Poses
so that you don't get lost!

162
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,120
Lost?

163
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,970
Try not to leave the island and go too far!

164
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,840
Leave the island? Why would we do that?

165
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,340
We're taking the shortest route,
along the inside track!

166
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,300
--I don't think it'll be that simple...
--Why not?

167
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,760
Just look!

168
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,810
Besides that gigantic one in the back,

169
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,030
all their other boats are on the
outside track, facing outward!

170
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,270
Suspicious, don't you think?!

171
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,110
Okay! On your marks!

172
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,860
Ready!

173
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,160
Why won't it be so simple?!

174
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,740
Just trust me! Men! Leave the
shore as soon as we start!

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,750
What'd he say?

176
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,380
--Why?!
--Grin...

177
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,590
Donut!

178
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,220
--I've got a bad feeling about this!
--Tell us why!

179
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,220
--Push it! Push it! Push it!
--Push it! Push it! Push it!

180
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,140
We're gonna teach ya what
this boat exists for!

181
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,900
What are these?

182
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Oh, no! We're too late!

183
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,650
What are these?

184
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,120
These are traps?

185
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,240
N-Nami! Don't...!

186
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,840
And there they are! The Mothership
Coaster's infamous Barrel Mines!

187
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,720
See you later!

188
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,560
Don't sink right away, though!
Give us some fun!

189
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,190
--Go away!
--Stupid things! I'm gonna send you flying!

190
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,990
Gum-Gum...!

191
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,980
--Stop, Luffy.
--Yeah! They'll explode like crazy!

192
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,870
But we have to do something...

193
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,440
We just gotta get rid of 'em
without touching 'em.

194
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,830
Hand me that oar, Luffy!

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,330
Wh-What are you doing, Zoro?!

196
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,830
Just watch...

197
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,140
Th-They're coming back!

198
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,450
Nami-san! Robin-chan! Hold on
to your boat! Ride the wave!

199
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,450
Huh?!

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,080
We can't ride that!

201
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,720
Yahoo! This is neat!

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Crap! We're breaking apart...

203
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,310
I'm scared!

204
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,080
That's cold water...

205
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,600
Wh-What the...?!

206
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,040
Oh! The Straw Hat teams are
speeding to the front of the pack!

207
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,750
Incredible!

208
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,830
Are you kidding me?!

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,170
No way! They're going to catch up to us!

210
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,270
Let's go, Monda! Give it
everything you've got!

211
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,220
Give us backup, you guys!

212
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,140
Right!

213
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,190
Finally calmed down...

214
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,610
Oh, man. The shock busted
the raft a little...

215
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,990
Whew, that was fun! I hope
there's another wave! Don't you?

216
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,200
Are you stupid?! We will sink next time!

217
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,660
I just hope the girls are
okay... There they are!

218
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,630
--Welcome!
--Welcome!

219
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,290
Wow!

220
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,710
What the...?!

221
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,700
Now, now. Don't be so cross.

222
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,470
Please, make yourselves comfortable...

223
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,660
Some inari sushi and
kitsune udon! No charge!

224
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,630
For real?! Thanks! Yum!

225
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,350
We'd love to have a cook like you join us!

226
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,520
Your twirly eyebrow's so cute!

227
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,240
Oh! Maybe I should be Davy Backed right now!

228
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,490
Gentleman in the fur coat--
you must be exhausted!

229
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,800
This isn't a fur coat!

230
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,780
Now, now! I have just the thing for you!

231
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,830
How does a candy apple sound?

232
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,620
What's that?! Is it sweet?!

233
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,290
Hey! Some more drinks over here!

234
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,290
Have all you want!

235
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,630
Thanks, guys!

236
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,120
And the Pleasure Boat and Harem
Nocturne unleash their secret move:

237
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,640
the Party Distraction!

238
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,140
Two Straw Hat boats have been KOed!

239
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,770
Yum! Seconds, please!

240
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,060
--Wow, this is sweet! You jerk!
--Whoa, you're really chowin' down!

241
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
Your beard's so cool!

242
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,270
Hey, you guys! Get back to the race!

243
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,990
Should you really be concerned
about others right now?

244
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,360
You need to focus on yourselves first!

245
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,990
Capote! Give 'em a taste
of your Fishman Karate!

246
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,450
Right!

247
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,090
Sea Surface Splitter!

248
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,700
The boat's come apart!

249
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,420
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

250
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,800
Luffy!

251
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,470
The girls are in trouble! Let's go!

252
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,680
--Chopper! Let's go!
--Huh?

253
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,250
--Nami-san! Robin-chan! I'll save you!
--Forget those floozies!

254
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,980
--Yeah!
--Come back, Twirly Eyebrow Man!

255
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,440
Our balance...!

256
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,690
Take this!

257
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,820
Special Attack: Flame Star!

258
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,610
That won't work!

259
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,700
Ocho Fleurs!

260
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
--What the...?!
--Capote!

261
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,510
Flip!

262
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,550
Oh, no!

263
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes! Now's our chance!

264
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,920
Usopp, swim and pull the boat!

265
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,960
Don't be crazy!

266
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,690
Capote! Monda! Pull yourselves together!

267
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,920
Paddle! Paddle!

268
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,590
All right! Currently in the lead
is the adorable Cutie Wagon!

269
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,970
In second is the Barrel Tiger, followed by--

270
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,220
Oh? When did they get back into it?

271
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,690
Followed by the Crab Crane!

272
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,490
Well, let's get to it, Hamburg.

273
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,060
Really? It's finally time, Boss?

274
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,490
Nami-san! Robin-chan! I'm coming to save you!

275
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,500
I have a great idea!

276
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,460
Sanji! Get me that!

277
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,750
--This thing's fast!
--Yeah, huh?!

278
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,220
Hang on, Nami-san! Robin-chan!

279
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,170
We're gettin' nowhere like this.
Wouldn't it be faster just to paddle?

280
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,490
Y-Yeah... But we used the oars for this.

281
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,910
Huh?! What?!

282
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,460
Not even a "hello," huh?

283
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,710
Sorry. This is just our style.

284
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,290
That so? In that case...

285
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,670
Bull Needles!

286
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,010
Zoro!

287
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,230
Damn! We're taking you down with us!

288
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,350
Chopper! Run!

289
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,940
The Basically Barrels and
Swordfish King #1 and #2 have sunk!

290
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Unfortunately, they're out of the race!

291
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,660
Chopper!

292
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,200
Thanks, Zoro...

293
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,830
They're out of the race...?!

294
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,720
Looks like it's up to us...

295
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,870
Oh, yeah! Usopp! Use a dial!

296
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,960
O-Oh, right!

297
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,750
All right! I'll use this Breath Dial to...!

298
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,880
Paddling would be faster than this!

299
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,720
Did we use up all the wind
escaping from Navarone Fortress?!

300
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,350
--Don't you have a Jet Dial?!
--Those are impossible to get!

301
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,890
What about an Impact Dial?

302
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,060
I-I left it on the Merry...

303
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,900
Wh-What?! You don't believe me?!
Why would I lie about that?!

304
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,150
One of our crew members is on the line here!

305
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,320
I didn't say anything.

306
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,870
Yeah! That's the issue!

307
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,870
If we end up losing,
they'll definitely take me first!

308
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,250
I can't let that happen! I'm too cute!

309
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,170
You wish. Now just paddle.

310
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,700
What?! This is no time for reading, Robin!

311
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm paddling too.

312
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,220
Your hands are, but you
don't seem like you're--

313
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,750
Yeah, Robin...

314
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,400
You'll end up like me if
you don't work hard...

315
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,360
I am working hard.

316
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,030
You're surprisingly savvy about the world...

317
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,130
Shall we head straight for the goal,
or shall we sink them instead?

318
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,490
I enjoy the occasional leisurely
trip across the goal line,

319
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,540
but I wanna make that chick pay!

320
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,170
Winning isn't enough for me now!

321
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,630
All right! The race has entered its climax!

322
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,710
The Cutie Wagon remains in the lead,

323
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,630
followed by the Barrel Tiger
and the Crab Crane in third!

324
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,010
Huh? Where'd the Crab Crane go?

325
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,680
Oh! There it is!

326
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,890
Damn!

327
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,730
Th-Those guys' kicks were insane!

328
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,980
Unbelievable! The Crab Crane is out
of the race! When did that happen?

329
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,070
What's that?!

330
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,950
What a lovely rendezvous!

331
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,910
See ya!

332
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,120
H-How are they going so fast?!

333
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,040
Out of strength...

334
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,520
They stopped!

335
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,230
Gum-Gum... Screw...

336
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,630
I'm out... of...

337
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,670
It appears he was in the water too long.

338
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,720
Hey! We better get paddling
or this'll all go to waste!

339
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,050
I don't know what you did, but we won't lose!

340
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,100
Oh, no! We just passed them, too!

341
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,850
You'll never get close to us again--!

342
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,310
What?!

343
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,230
--How is this?
--Wonderful, Robin!

344
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,150
Cheater!

345
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,350
Let go!

346
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,990
They already caught on. Too bad.

347
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,620
Capote!

348
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,780
How dare they?!

349
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,490
Luffy! Can you try it...

350
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,960
...again?

351
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,460
I don't think he'll be much help for a while.

352
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,880
Let's just keep moving!
We can't let 'em get a bigger lead!

353
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,670
Yeah! Let's go!

354
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,140
I guess I'll sink them after all.

355
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,270
Oh!

356
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,140
Ahh!

357
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,390
Up ahead are the biggest obstacles
of the course: the Long Coral Reef

358
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:38,020
and the Long Ring Whirlpool
of Long Cape beyond it!

359
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,440
How will they overcome these?! And...

360
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,190
Oh! Is that...?!

361
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,320
What?

362
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,610
There's someone on the island!

363
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,620
It's "Full Dash" Hamburg!

364
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,820
Atop him, making an appearance at last,
is the Master of Obstruction!

365
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,620
The great scoundrel who
hates fairness: our boss!

366
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,790
"Silver Fox" Foxy!

367
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,340
Him!

368
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,010
I just got an evil idea!

369
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,230
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

370
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,780
Chasing after something constant

371
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,410
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

372
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,660
Even when we're exhausted

373
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,830
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

374
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,250
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

375
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,170
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

376
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

377
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,930
We pray to this endless
sky that we look up at

378
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,020
Eternally... Eternally...

379
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,810
Wild fantasies from our childhood

380
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,650
We trace unforgettable memories

381
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,320
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

382
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

383
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,950
Together we entrust our feelings

384
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,540
We go beyond the changing time

385
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,330
Eternally... Eternally...

386
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,670
So many idiots! I'll be too embarrassed
to live if we lose to these guys!

387
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,390
They'll take our crew, too!
That's even worse!

388
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,390
We're gonna lose if we don't do
something! Time for my trump card!

389
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,270
Oh, man! Who's winning?!

390
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,080
I've actually eaten a--!

391
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,070
--On the next episode of One Piece!
--Let me finish!

392
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,330
"'Silver Fox' Foxy! The
Merciless Interference"

393
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
