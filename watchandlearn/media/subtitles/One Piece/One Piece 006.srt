2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,550
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,610
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,770
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,390
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,910
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,520
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,210
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,010
We are!

24
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,360
Alright! Light it flashily!

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,870
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

26
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,550
Zoro!

27
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,370
Stabbing him from behind is unfair,

28
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,480
Big Nose!

29
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,160
Hey, Zoro. You're hurt, you know...

30
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,770
Just shut up and stay in there!

31
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,250
I'm gonna do things my way!

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
Who is this guy?!

33
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,260
Luffy... Who's she?

34
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,420
Oh, she's our navigator!

35
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,670
Get serious! Who are you guys?!

36
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,360
Move...

37
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,180
You're in the way!

38
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,140
"Desperate Situation!
Beast Tamer Mohji vs. Luffy!"

39
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,420
Why would you go that far?

40
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,890
You're a pirate!

41
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,900
Those three think they
can mock me! Screw that!

42
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,940
Looks like I can consider this
a declaration of war against me!

43
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,080
Mohji! There you are!

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,910
Would you mind if I take
Roronoa Zoro's head?

45
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,970
Be my guest!

46
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,530
What's with this dog?

47
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,770
Dog!

48
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,870
Hey, Zoro! It's not moving at all!

49
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,930
Hell if I care!
It can do whatever it wants!

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,320
I wonder if it's dead?!

51
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,230
Oww! Oww! Oww!

52
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,550
Oww! What're you doing, stupid dog?!

53
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
Do you know the situation
we're in right now?!

54
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,710
Damn dog!

55
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,580
Not enough blood...

56
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,260
Heya, Navigator!

57
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,680
I guess you can have this,
since you did save me!

58
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,740
Oh! The key to the cage!

59
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,310
You went and got it for me?!

60
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,230
Don't get the wrong idea!

61
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,270
I just didn't want to wind up owing you!

62
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,860
I'm saved!

63
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,840
Stupid dog! Stupid dog!

64
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,290
That's not food!

65
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,170
Gimme that key back!

66
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,650
Give it back! Give it back!

67
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,130
Stop that!

68
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,090
Quit bullying Chouchou, you young'uns!

69
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,060
Chouchou?

70
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,010
Who're you, old man?

71
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,330
I'm this town's mayor! Who are you?!

72
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,970
Huh?

73
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,980
My, what a terrible injury!

74
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,300
I take it Buggy went after you folks, too?

75
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,640
We need to get you to a doctor!

76
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,160
How's Zoro?!

77
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,780
He needs to see a doctor,

78
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,750
but he said he'd sleep
it off and went to bed.

79
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,430
So this dog's name is Chouchou?

80
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,360
What's it just sitting here for?

81
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,310
It's guarding the shop.

82
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,790
Guarding?

83
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,720
Yes...

84
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,380
Oh! This is a pet food shop!

85
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,270
Yes.

86
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,010
This shop's owner is
a good friend of mine...

87
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,240
There you go.

88
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,880
So I'm here to feed his dog in his place.

89
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,640
In his place?

90
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,690
Yes.

91
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,140
He died three months ago, from an illness.

92
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,330
Don't tell me he's been waiting for
his master to return all this time?

93
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,980
That's what everyone says...

94
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,360
...but I don't think that's it.

95
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Chouchou is a smart dog.

96
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,410
He's probably long known
that his master is dead.

97
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,630
Then why is he guarding the shop?

98
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
I think it's because this shop is
a treasure in Chouchou's eyes.

99
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,180
I think he continues to protect it

100
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,930
because it's a memento
of his dog-loving master.

101
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,750
I've tried to make him
evacuate on many occasions,

102
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,930
but he won't take as much
as a step away from here.

103
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,780
What's that war cry?!

104
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,630
It's him! Beast Tamer Mohji!

105
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,850
What do you mean by "Beast Tamer"?!

106
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,640
W-Wait! Hold on!

107
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,130
C'mon, something's here!

108
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,940
Give me the key back!

109
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,270
Oh, I see your friends have deserted you.

110
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,160
Just after you managed to escape, too...

111
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,950
Who're you?

112
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,320
I am Beast Tamer Mohji,
a member of the Buggy Pirates.

113
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,000
That sure is a weird
animal suit you got on!

114
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,340
How rude! This is my hair!

115
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,130
That's even weirder!

116
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,430
Do you think you can rest easy
because you're inside that cage?

117
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,360
You must not know my terrifying skill!

118
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,200
There is no animal in this world...

119
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,680
...that Beast Tamer Mohji can't tame!

120
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,310
Shake!

121
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,450
You're nothing but a
nameless sneak thief.

122
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,230
I have no interest in taking your life.

123
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,030
Tell me where Roronoa Zoro is!

124
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
No!

125
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,450
Sic him, Richie!

126
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,040
Yes! The cage is open!

127
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,340
An instant death.

128
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,330
Good Richie.

129
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,040
Now let's find Zoro,

130
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,480
so I can defeat him
and increase my name!

131
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,870
What is it?

132
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,780
Ah, a pet food store.

133
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,850
Alright, make your meal quick!

134
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,930
Huh? Don't tell me this is this
pathetic little shop's guard dog?

135
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,160
Whew, what a shock!

136
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,250
But now I'm out of that cage!

137
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,100
Alright! Now it's time
to beat all of them up...

138
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,420
...and have Nami the thief
be our navigator!

139
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,250
How are you alive?!

140
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,430
You're alive!

141
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,220
Is it wrong to be alive?

142
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,820
Being just fine after flying
through houses isn't normal!

143
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,860
It's not?

144
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,670
What is your purpose
for coming to this town?

145
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,570
Why are you involved
with those pirates?

146
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,650
I just decided our purpose!

147
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,530
To get a Grand Line map and a navigator!

148
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,380
I think that guy in the animal suit
said he was looking for Zoro!

149
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,330
I'll go check on him!

150
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,140
Chouchou. This shop
belongs to the two of us!

151
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,470
This bag is too big for you, Chouchou!

152
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,680
You don't want to get hurt, Chouchou!

153
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,280
Just leave it to me!

154
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,540
Bad Chouchou! I told you
not to eat the merchandise!

155
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,540
Now let's chow down!

156
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Oh? You still come at us...

157
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,040
Chouchou. I'm getting up in age now.

158
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,450
I gotta check into the hospital.

159
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,090
But I will get better!

160
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,590
Guard the shop well until I come back!

161
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,730
Hold down the fort!

162
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,580
That tickles, Chouchou!

163
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,220
I think it's because this shop is
a treasure in Chouchou's eyes.

164
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,040
I think he continues to protect it...

165
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,420
...because it's a memento
of his dog-loving master.

166
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,330
Damn it! That dog even bit me!

167
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,130
Wait! I just killed you!

168
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,720
I won't die that easily!

169
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,810
Crunch his head for sure this time!

170
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,100
I won't lose to some lion!

171
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,640
Gum-Gum...

172
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
...Hammer!

173
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
Richie!

174
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,480
What are you?!

175
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,460
I ate the Gum-Gum Fruit!

176
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,350
You mean you have Devil Fruit powers,

177
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,420
just like Captain Buggy?!

178
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,260
A-all right! I peacefully
apologize to you!

179
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,460
You don't need to apologize now.

180
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,230
'Cause that dog's treasure
is never coming back.

181
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,030
That's why I'm gonna kick your ass!

182
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,470
Pirates are all the same, every last one!

183
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,440
They take what people hold dear
without a second thought!

184
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,150
Oh, you're alive, pirate!

185
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,840
I figured the lion ate you for sure!

186
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,950
As a pirate, you'll do the same thing!

187
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,560
Maybe I should kill you right here
before you can gather a crew...

188
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,010
...and attack people too!

189
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,270
Come! Stop that, girl!

190
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,080
As if you could ever kill me.

191
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,560
Maybe I'll try and see, then!

192
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,910
I said stop! What's with you people?!

193
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,060
This is all I could take back.

194
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,390
Bastard ate all the rest.

195
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,100
He... fought with that lion.

196
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,030
For that dog's sake...

197
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,810
You fought good!

198
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,110
I didn't see your fight, but I can tell!

199
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,840
Yeah! Good luck to you, too!

200
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,160
You were beaten?!

201
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,910
I- I'm very sorry, Captain Buggy!

202
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,880
Mohji! I can't believe
you'd lose to Zoro!

203
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,710
No, it wasn't Zoro!
It was that Straw Hat!

204
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,800
What?! That straw hat kid beat you?!

205
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,670
He's eaten the--

206
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,310
Now I'm pissed!

207
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,630
Prepare all the Special
Buggy Balls we have!

208
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm gonna blow this entire
town to smithereens!

209
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,510
Sorry about earlier!

210
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,970
Huh?

211
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,670
I didn't mean to yell at you...

212
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,400
It's okay! You've been through a lot!

213
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,490
I don't feel like hearing
about it though.

214
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,710
I'm so pathetic!

215
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,850
Chouchou and this
young'un will fight so hard,

216
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,910
yet why must I, the mayor, sit by
and watch our town be obliterated?!

217
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,870
Calm down, Mayor!

218
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,050
40 years ago, this place
was nothing but barren land.

219
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,900
We all worked together to
clear the land, make fields,

220
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,370
open stores, and build our town.

221
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,560
This town is a treasure
to me and all the citizens!

222
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,300
I cannot let them
domineer over it any more!

223
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,280
Fire a Special Buggy Ball!
Blow the town away!

224
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,920
Even my own house...

225
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,920
Zoro's sleeping in there!

226
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,250
The young'un is dead now...

227
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,250
Hey! Zoro! Are you alive?!

228
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,290
That's one hell of a way
to wake a guy up...

229
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,090
Not enough sleep...

230
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,730
How are you still alive?!

231
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,720
Thank goodness! You're alive!

232
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,210
I refuse to let them get away with this!

233
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,510
I can stand this no more!

234
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:19,840
Some random scum has no right
to suddenly destroy our 40 years!

235
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,280
I am this town's mayor!

236
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,290
I will protect this town!

237
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,210
Stop! Stop, Mayor!

238
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,710
There are fights a man cannot run from!

239
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,390
Isn't that right, young'un?!

240
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,510
That's right, old man!

241
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,820
Don't urge him on!

242
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,390
What can he possibly do by
going to see them?! It's reckless!

243
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,350
I'm fully aware it's reckless!

244
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,480
I'm coming for you, Buggy the Clown!

245
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
The mayor was crying...

246
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,950
He was? I didn't see it.

247
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,460
Looks like the party's
gettin' more exciting!

248
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,650
Sure does!

249
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,200
This is no time to be laughing!

250
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,330
It's okay! I like that old guy!

251
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,660
I absolutely won't let him die!

252
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,680
In that case...

253
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,500
You're gonna go, too?!
With that wound?!

254
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,330
The injury to my name is much
worse than the injury to my gut!

255
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,250
Our destination is the Grand Line.

256
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,440
So we're gonna steal
that map back now!

257
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Join our crew, Nami!

258
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,460
I'll never be a pirate.

259
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,860
How about we team up
for our common goal?

260
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,870
The second shot is ready, sir!

261
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,280
Alright! Fire!

262
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,750
Come out, Buggy the Clown!

263
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,410
I am Mayor Boodle!

264
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,210
This town is our treasure!
I've come to protect it! Fight me!

265
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,200
What are you, stupid?!
Treasure is gold, silver, and jewels!

266
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,230
This town, a treasure?! Cut the crap!

267
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,010
You'd never understand how I feel--

268
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,160
I'm soon going to conquer
the Grand Line and flashily obtain...

269
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,860
...all of the world's riches!

270
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,990
The world's riches are mine!

271
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,950
No one else in this world
needs treasure but me!

272
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,320
If this town's that important to you,
shall I destroy you with it?!

273
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,080
Quit prattling and fight me!

274
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,920
Don't get cocky now!

275
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,670
I won't let you destroy this town!
Even if it costs me my life!

276
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,260
Fire!

277
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,300
The straw hat guy!

278
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,540
I'm here to kick your ass,
just like I promised!

279
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

280
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

281
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

282
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

283
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

284
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

285
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,490
so that my memories won't fade

286
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,980
Huh? Now there's some
swordsman or whatever guy!

287
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,650
I'll clash swords with him!

288
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,680
You sure? You're injured...

289
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,280
I'll show you our difference in level!

290
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,610
Ooh! Cool!

291
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,420
My ambition is to be the
world's greatest swordsman!

292
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,000
I can't afford to lose to anyone
who calls himself a swordfighter!

293
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,320
On the next episode of One Piece!

294
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,980
"Epic Showdown!
Swordsman Zoro vs. Acrobat Cabaji!"

295
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
