2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,330
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,180
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,050
Realizing their ship needs to be
coated to reach Fishman Island,

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,220
the Straw Hat crew landed
on the Sabaody Archipelago.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,290
There they met Rayleigh, a skilled craftsman

53
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,000
and the former vice-captain
of the Roger Pirates.

54
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,180
However, Sentomaru,
captain of the Science Unit,

55
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,410
stood before the crew.

56
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,520
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

57
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,590
Luffy!

58
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,180
Navy Admiral Kizaru appeared next,

59
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,440
and Luffy and friends found
themselves in a grave situation!

60
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,610
Now you can have a nice, long rest...

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,790
Zoro!

62
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,960
You're getting involved in this...

63
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,560
...Dark King Rayleigh?!

64
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,610
Don't be plucking these young sprouts!

65
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,680
Their era is just about to begin!

66
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,050
Old guy!

67
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,110
Thanks to Rayleigh's help,

68
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,000
it appeared the crew had escaped danger,

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,020
but then Bartholomew Kuma,
a Warlord of the Sea, also appeared!

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
We will never meet again.

71
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,400
Farewell...

72
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,760
And so the Straw Hat crew
suffered a complete collapse.

73
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,860
"Landing! The All-Female Island,
Amazon Lily"

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,610
D-Damn...

75
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,020
I can't seem to wink right...!

76
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,710
Duval-sama! We found it! A bay by Grove #41!

77
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,100
Got it! I'll be right there!

78
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,180
Alright, men!

79
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,010
Protect it at all costs,
in the name of the Rosy Life Riders!

80
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,900
Yes, sir!

81
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,690
Hurry, Motobalo! Grove #41!

82
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:17,270
Still, what were those
island-shaking shockwaves?

83
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,650
I hope they're okay...

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,730
You still haven't caught them?!

85
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,730
Admiral Kizaru is currently pursuing them,

86
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,460
so it should only be a matter of time!

87
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,560
Please have patience!

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,590
You pathetic, dimwitted dogs!

89
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,190
Not only did they do this
to my father and brother,

90
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,800
but they also let all of our slaves escape!

91
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,910
What do they take the blood
of this world's Creators for?!

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
When I get my hands on them,

93
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,030
I'm going to put them through
a living hell so horrible

94
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,720
that they'll crawl on the ground
and beg for forgiveness!

95
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,850
Duval-sama.

96
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,870
What's taking Young Master Straw Hat
and the others so long?

97
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,520
Maybe they're busy with
the people chasing ‘em?

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,060
I heard the port's in a real uproar!

99
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,030
Yeah. I saw it from the air.

100
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,380
Marines and pirates were having at it.

101
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,210
It was a real mess!

102
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,360
Then that's all the more
reason to stay sharp!

103
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,010
We don't want any idiots showing up
and taking off with this ship!

104
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,790
Guard it well until the
coating craftsman arrives!

105
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,390
Rosy Life Riders!

106
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,410
Yes, Duva-some!

107
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,180
I'm suddenly feeling uneasy.

108
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,060
I hope Luffy-chin and the others are okay...

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,320
What's with you, Camie?!

110
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't say worrisome stuff like that!

111
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,550
But...

112
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,780
They're strong.
There's nothing to worry about, Camie...

113
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
I hope you're right...

114
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,010
You "hope"? Knock that off!

115
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,200
You saw for yourself how strong they are!

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,740
They'll be fine!

117
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,930
They're up against a navy admiral.

118
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,190
Not even Monkey-chan's group
stands a chance strength-wise.

119
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,030
The seas ahead will be rough.

120
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,490
Giant waves they've never
seen before are coming.

121
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,770
They mustn't let these waves do them in.

122
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,350
There. Can you hear it?

123
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,630
Little by little, the tide of
the times is beginning to change.

124
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,140
Meanwhile, Monkey D. Luffy,
after being ejected

125
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,220
from Sabaody Archipelago
by Bartholomew Kuma...

126
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,470
Damn it!

127
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,770
Zoro! Nami!

128
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,000
Usopp! Sanji! Chopper!

129
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,890
Robin! Franky! Brook!

130
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,890
Where did you send all my friends?!

131
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,010
Where did you disappear to, guys?!

132
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,830
That bear-like Warlord
of the Sea is gonna pay!

133
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,040
How far am I gonna fly, anyway?!

134
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,700
Oh, come to think of it...

135
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,930
I don't know if it's true or not,
but they say that his paw pads

136
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,440
can send a person flying through the
sky for three days and three nights!

137
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,860
Then, could that mean that
instead of disappearing,

138
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,600
they were all sent flying like this too?

139
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,860
I wonder if that axe guy
was telling the truth...

140
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,060
Three whole days of this...

141
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,070
I'm dead if I fall into the ocean...

142
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm hungry, too...

143
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,250
But... I'm feeling sleepy...

144
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,750
Zoro... Nami...

145
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,670
Usopp... Sanji... Chopper...

146
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,500
Robin... Franky... Brook...

147
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,840
Everyone!

148
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,470
Through the sky he continued to soar.

149
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,780
And then...

150
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,190
I'm alive...

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,240
I don't think my being rubber
is why I'm still alive...

152
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,530
But what's this bear paw-looking thing?

153
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,100
I just hope the others
were saved the same way...

154
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,710
Anyway, I gotta get back!

155
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,840
Where is this...

156
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,490
...and which way is Sabaody Archipelago?!

157
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,650
Oh, yeah!

158
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,610
I have my Vivre Card!

159
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,100
Good thing we all got one!

160
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,160
Alright! I gotta go back!
I gotta get back there!

161
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,340
I'm sure I'll see everyone again!

162
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,410
That way!

163
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,260
Everyone focus on escaping!

164
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,380
As we are now, we can't beat these guys!

165
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,100
Just get out of here!

166
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,390
You can think things over after you're safe!

167
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,370
Go!

168
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,270
What's wrong with me?!

169
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,540
I couldn't save even one of my friends...!

170
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,170
Ouch!

171
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,250
Actually, that doesn't hurt,

172
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,420
but oh, there's something in the way...

173
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,850
Still...

174
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,960
...the card is pointing this way...

175
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,280
Alright!

176
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,570
Giant Pistol!

177
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,930
N-No good...

178
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,730
I'm out of strength...

179
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,940
Sanji! Food!

180
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,110
Oh, wait, he's not here...

181
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,850
"Stomach rumble"

182
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,550
"Stomach rumble"
"Stomach rumble"
"Stomach rumble"

183
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,870
Thanks for the food!

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,040
This brings back memories

185
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,090
of when Grandpa would throw me
into the jungle when I was a kid!

186
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,830
I don't wanna remember that.

187
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,860
This place sure is quiet, though...

188
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,610
Aren't these Laughing Mushrooms?

189
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,970
Yeah! This is perfect for times like this!

190
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,350
Now I'm having fun!

191
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,050
Even though I'm all alone!

192
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,580
There are some weird ones over here, too!

193
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,570
Now I'm feeling mad!

194
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,960
Laughing Mushrooms! Laughing Mushrooms!

195
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,840
Oh! There are weird mushrooms here, too!

196
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,070
Crying Mushrooms!

197
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,790
Hurry! The smoke is rising from over there!

198
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,670
They've been anchored offshore for a while;

199
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,250
you don't think they secretly
made landfall, do you?!

200
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,990
If so, then this is very serious!

201
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,950
No! There's heavy security
all around the island!

202
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,200
Besides, if by some chance
they did get through,

203
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,730
it's hard to believe they'd do anything
to draw attention to themselves!

204
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,440
Then who is it?

205
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,750
I don't know.

206
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,110
Let's split into two groups now!

207
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,220
Got it!

208
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,810
What is that?!

209
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,730
Margaret! Margaret!

210
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,940
Over here!

211
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,070
What is it, Sweetpea?

212
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,320
What do you make of this?

213
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,110
Of what?

214
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,650
What do you suppose this is?

215
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,080
Wh-What the...?! This is a person!

216
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,810
Is it someone from the village?

217
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,620
I don't know.

218
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,570
There are so many mushrooms
growing out of her body...

219
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,840
Do you think maybe it was actually
a signal fire calling for help?

220
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,580
This is it.

221
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,180
Look! She ate this mushroom!

222
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,990
A Parasite Mushroom.

223
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,740
When eaten, mushrooms
grow out of your body!

224
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,860
This is bad!

225
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,240
If we don't do something, the mushrooms
will sap away her vitality and kill her!

226
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,860
So it's a race against time!

227
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,860
Aphelandra! Carry her to the village!

228
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,750
Okay!

229
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,770
To the village it is!

230
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,950
Let's hurry!

231
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,390
We have an urgent patient!

232
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,940
Hey! Down in front! I can't see!

233
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,370
What happened to her?!
She's covered in mushrooms!

234
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,110
Have you seen her in the village before?

235
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,650
No, never...

236
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,710
Hey, who is she?

237
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,120
The mushrooms are covering her face...

238
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,820
Where do you think she came from?

239
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,880
Is she even alive?

240
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,260
She ate a Parasite Mushroom.

241
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,140
What should we do, Belladonna?

242
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,670
They come off when pulled,
so pull them out. All of them.

243
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,590
They come off?

244
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,060
They really do!

245
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,380
But some of the roots are left behind!

246
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,130
I'll get rid of them afterward,
so don't worry about the roots.

247
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,470
You've certainly brought
a strange one home, Margaret.

248
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I couldn't help it!

249
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,640
She was barely alive,
and she might be from the village!

250
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,290
That's all of them!

251
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,830
Okay. Now step back a little.

252
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,460
Ouch! Hot! Hot!

253
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,170
I-I-I'm on fire!

254
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,320
Put me out! Ouch!

255
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,430
Hold on, Belladonna! What are you doing?!

256
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,710
This is the only way to keep
them from growing back.

257
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,060
But isn't that a little excessive?

258
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,880
She passed out again!

259
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,160
Still, she was covered in injuries
before she was covered in mushrooms.

260
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Really?

261
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,470
They seem like marks
from a tremendous battle.

262
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,690
We'll need to treat her wounds, too.

263
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,950
I hate to ask, Margaret,

264
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,830
but could you go wash her off in the river?

265
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,810
O-Okay! Sure!

266
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,690
It sounds like she's not from
this village after all, Sweetpea.

267
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,800
Yeah...

268
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,570
Huh? Look here!

269
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,540
What's wrong?

270
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,270
There's still a mushroom
between her legs that we missed!

271
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,250
There's one left!

272
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,830
But doesn't this one seem
different from the others?

273
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,430
It's oddly shaped!

274
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,690
Huh? There's something
weird underneath it, too!

275
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,080
What is this? A Sack Mushroom?

276
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,230
Anyway, I guess we better pull it off!

277
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,590
Alright!

278
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,240
It won't come off! How come?!

279
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,250
It's stretching!

280
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,450
Hey, what's going on? What happened?

281
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,780
She says it stretches...

282
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,870
What does?!

283
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,070
A mushroom!

284
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,110
Seriously? Is it a Neat Mushroom?

285
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,720
That's enough gawking, all of you!

286
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,490
This isn't a freak show!

287
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,210
You're watching too, you know!

288
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,950
Look! There seems to be a problem!

289
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,580
Still, she's not very well-endowed.

290
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,090
She even seems sort of rugged.

291
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,990
It's no use.

292
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,600
Maybe Aphelandra can pull it off!

293
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,430
Huh? Me?

294
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,040
Yeah, yeah!

295
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,200
I bet it'll come off if you
pull as hard as you can!

296
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,330
Maybe we should all pull it together!

297
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,350
No.

298
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,420
If that mushroom won't come off...

299
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,280
...then we should simply
burn it off as Belladonna did!

300
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,140
Oh! Yes! That's a good idea!

301
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,590
Don't you agree, Margaret?

302
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,550
Yes!

303
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,680
What's this? What's this?

304
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,260
What's going on?

305
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,160
Oh, Granny Nyon!

306
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,020
There's a mushroom growing
on this girl that won't come off!

307
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,310
So we're deciding whether
we should pull it off all together

308
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,420
or burn it off.

309
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,100
Now, now. Wait. Just who is this?

310
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,070
This is it here.

311
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's see here...

312
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,730
Where is this mushroom?

313
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,770
Oh, my!

314
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,750
Granny Nyon!

315
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,340
Are you all right?!

316
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,490
Y-Yes, th-there's nothing to worry about...

317
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,510
Th-This person...

318
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,030
Th-This person...

319
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,030
...is a m-m-man!

320
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,130
Th-This is a m-man?!

321
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,790
I've never seen one before!

322
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,690
Here sits the maiden island of Amazon Lily,

323
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:56,730
"Kuja"

324
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,730
inhabited by the tribe of
female warriors known as the Kuja.

325
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,570
May you never dream of it or step foot on it,

326
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,460
should you still value your life.

327
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,310
The imprisoned Luffy

328
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,070
