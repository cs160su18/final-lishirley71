2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,240
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,980
Having entered Upper Yard's Illusion Forest,

21
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,610
Luffy and the others faced the rigorous
"Ball Ordeal" of Priest Satori.

22
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,190
Meanwhile, Gan Fall is defeated by Priest Shura.

23
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,270
Sky Knight!!

24
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,220
Hey, Nami! See anything?!

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,540
This means you declare war on God Eneru!

26
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,250
Shut your mouth! Or the flavor will escape.

27
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,340
This is... a love ordeal!

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,260
Is this guy an idiot, too?!

29
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,210
Concasser!

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,800
"Light the Fire of Shandora! Wyper, the Warrior"

31
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,430
Gan Fall, the former God, went into Upper Yard.

32
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,030
I doubt Eneru'd leave him alone.

33
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,240
Is Gan Fall trying to fight Eneru?

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,250
No way... It's hard to think
that he'd be that determined.

35
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,260
What's the matter, Aisa?

36
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,870
Two voices disappeared.

37
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,740
What'd you say?!

38
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,200
Hm? Is that your Mantra?

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,640
Yeah... Just now...

40
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,210
Your Mantra is saying so, Aisa?

41
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,670
You can't hear two voices
anymore... Is that true?!

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,740
There's no mistake about it.

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,960
You all know that since she
was born, she can use Mantra,

44
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,270
a mysterious power, which enables her
to sense people from even far away.

45
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,720
So you can't hear two people's voices anymore?

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
Yes... They disappeared
around the same time...

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,540
I think it's Gan Fall and one of the priests...

48
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,300
Killed each other simultaneously?

49
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,210
Well done, old man.

50
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,880
Now there are three priests left.

51
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,460
This works in our favor.

52
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,400
Looks like Heaven has answered our prayers.

53
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,240
This is our chance to crush the priests.

54
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,820
Yeah!

55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,740
We'll launch a full-scale attack
on Upper Yard immediately!

56
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah!!

57
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,250
You've never been comfortable
around Wyper, have you?

58
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,730
Now, out of my way.

59
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,270
Ow!

60
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,870
Hey, Laki, wait!

61
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,480
What is it?

62
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,470
The priest wasn't defeated by Gan Fall.

63
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,650
There're other people there, and they did it.

64
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,990
Other people?

65
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,000
You mean the Blue Sea people
who entered Skypiea?

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,980
I don't know, but they're definitely scary!

67
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,540
So...

68
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,900
...be careful.

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,350
Okay... Aisa, give me your bag.

70
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,850
What?! No! This is my secret bag
and I have my treasure in it!

71
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,450
I know.

72
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,320
I'll get some for you, too.

73
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,070
Really?!

74
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,630
Yeah.

75
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,180
He's finally stopped his blabbering.

76
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,830
Bastard! Mocking us with
a bunch of stupid tricks...

77
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,570
What's with these guys?
How'd he know our attacks and stuff?

78
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,540
Hey!!

79
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,340
Luffy! Sanji! I found the boat!

80
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,120
Hurry up! Or it'll leave the forest!

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,970
Hm? Oh, Usopp was okay.

82
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,920
Hey, he's saying the boat's leaving!

83
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,790
Oh, crap! It's almost on the
route that exits the forest!

84
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,010
Hey! Hold on to my body!

85
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,630
To your body?!

86
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,260
Here goes!

87
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,510
Usopp Aa-aa-aa!

88
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,340
All right! I got it!

89
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,270
Yahoo! You're the man, Usopp!

90
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,770
Ouch! That hurt! Are you trying to kill me?!

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,660
Just got a little carried away

92
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,200
Man, you threw my back out!

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,720
Whoa! You can fix it that easy?

94
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,920
Nothing is impossible for me.

95
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,870
You can be pretty cool sometimes!

96
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,290
Yeah! You underestimated me, didn't you?!

97
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,780
Huh?

98
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,260
Huh? Huh? Hey! Hey, hey!

99
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,820
H-H-H-Hold on a second!
What're you doing?! Hey, let me go!

100
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,580
Oh, Sanji-kun. If we're gonna
die, let's go together.

101
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,770
M-Me, too?!

102
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,320
No biggie...

103
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,520
I'll get you for this!

104
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,190
It would've been better if I stretched myself.

105
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,860
In any case, we're now getting
out of the Illusion Forest.

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,530
Oh, yeah... I can't swim.

107
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,570
Sky Knight!

108
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,480
That weird bird, too.

109
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,910
Oh yeah, he has a Devil
Fruit power, just like I do.

110
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,960
Dammit! I couldn't... save them.

111
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,740
Oh, no... I feel... faint.

112
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,120
So, Satori has fallen.

113
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,190
What a novice, disturbing his Mantra!

114
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,450
If I'm not mistaken, the illegal
entrants this time are Blue Sea people.

115
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,790
It seems they're no ordinary people.

116
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,420
The sacrifices are moving about freely as well.

117
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,690
However, even if we leave them alone for now,

118
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,240
they probably won't find a way off of this island.

119
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,200
More importantly, we have to...

120
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,260
"Skypiea Priest
Sky Punk Gedatsu"

121
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,500
Do you sense the voice of
a sorrowful warrior, Holy?

122
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,220
No matter how many times we fight,
the result is always the same.

123
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,790
Shura defeated Gan Fall,
but the "Ball Ordeal" was broken.

124
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,150
What a turbulent day today is!

125
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,380
I won't let them through here. It's insolent
for them to even try to see God.

126
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,470
Although the sun will soon set,

127
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,090
it seems that Upper Yard will now become...

128
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,560
"Skypiea Priest
Sky Breeder Ohm"

129
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,560
...a little rattled.

130
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:31,070
"Skypiea Priest
Sky Rider Shura"

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,400
I don't care about the escapees anymore.

132
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,800
It seems some opponents who
should face my anger have appeared.

133
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,190
Listen up, everyone!

134
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,350
Upper Yard is rattled right now!

135
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,280
This is the opportunity of a lifetime!

136
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,670
No matter what, head for "God's Shrine"!

137
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,480
Don't fear Eneru!

138
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,160
The Great Warrior Calgara is
our one and only Preserver!

139
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,260
Yeah!!

140
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,060
Braham!

141
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,680
Yeah!

142
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,740
Kamakiri!

143
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,590
Genbou!

144
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,500
Yeah!

145
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,640
Laki!

146
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,130
Yeah!

147
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,570
Come back safely! We're splitting up here!

148
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,970
We vow to the Great Warrior Calgara
to light the fire of Shandora!!

149
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,530
Yeah!!

150
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,540
So you've come, Shandians!

151
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,870
Don't tell me... this island is...?!

152
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,700
What was that?!

153
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,480
It's an explosion.

154
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,010
I heard some earlier,
but this one seems different.

155
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,910
More importantly, we have to move on!

156
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,370
Umph! What's the big rush, Nami?!

157
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,450
You've been acting strange. What did you see?

158
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,930
Did you see God or something?

159
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,700
No, that's not it!

160
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,280
Even if I explain,
you probably can't understand...

161
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,560
Dammit! I keep slipping! Why is
it so hard to walk around here?!

162
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,270
You're the one who said
this way would be faster.

163
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,310
Just spit it out already! Just what did you see?!

164
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,460
No questions. Just follow me!

165
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,420
We have to get to the seashore somehow.

166
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,870
Hey! Give me a hand!!

167
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,860
Shouldn't you be the one in front
if you want us to follow you?!

168
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,990
Seashore?

169
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,030
That's right.

170
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,790
In any case, we have to get
close to it to check it out...

171
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,680
...because I still can't believe my own eyes.

172
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,410
I, too...

173
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:27,880
Hm?

174
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,180
I, too, have something
that's been bugging me...

175
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,140
...although I don't have any proof.

176
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,440
If this theory I dreamed up
turns out to be true...

177
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,430
...it'd be interesting. It'd be interesting.

178
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,900
Maybe my goal in life is still attainable.

179
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,480
It's only a theory, though.

180
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,230
Oh?

181
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,690
I'm alive?

182
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,120
Ouch!!

183
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,800
Sky Knight!

184
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,340
Doctor! Doctor! Oh, that's me!

185
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,500
Good... He's still alive.

186
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,070
But this is strange.

187
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,180
I thought we sank in the river.

188
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,720
I wonder who pulled us out.

189
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,210
Hm?! Who is it? He said God...

190
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,730
Who just spoke?!

191
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,130
What? What? What?!

192
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,600
What?!

193
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,380
Why...?

194
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,570
We're close to the sea.

195
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,530
Hm?

196
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,560
I can hear waves now. Listen...

197
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,680
You're right! We're almost there!

198
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,330
Now, let's go! Hurry up!

199
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,280
Like I said, what's there?

200
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,460
Have you lost it?

201
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,490
I hear noises mixed in with the waves as well.

202
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,430
Yeah, sounds just like a battle.

203
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,980
The sound of many people charging...

204
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,360
I heard enough of that in Alabasta.

205
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,970
I wonder if things are all right.

206
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,260
If you mean Chopper, don't worry about him.

207
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,930
When push comes to shove,
he can take care of himself.

208
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,300
No, I meant our captain and the others.

209
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,360
Luffy?

210
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,400
I doubt he'd just sit by after we got kidnapped.

211
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,960
Yeah, he wanted to come to
this island to begin with.

212
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,250
I don't know what this God person is up to,

213
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,720
but he probably wouldn't
just let them through.

214
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,840
And now, a totally different fight is going on.

215
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,140
The situation has gotten a bit complicated.

216
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah, it certainly has.

217
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,620
But, well, they're probably okay, since
they're used to being in all sorts of trouble.

218
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,310
Getting worked up over little
stuff like this gets us nowhere.

219
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,360
You're right.

220
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,750
Ahhh... Ouch...

221
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,880
Hey, Nami! Hey!

222
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,710
This is how you gotta do it, Usopp.

223
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,370
Alright. Hey! It's about time you woke up!

224
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,010
Hm? Is it morning already?

225
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,510
That's just like Zoro!

226
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,260
Pay attention, you idiots!

227
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,440
We don't even know what's going on
with Nami-san and Robin-chan.

228
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,070
Uhm, and Zoro and Chopper...?

229
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,440
There're three more priests.

230
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,730
There may be other ordeals waiting for us.

231
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,280
This is... a love ordeal.

232
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,520
In any case, we have no choice
but to get to the altar quickly.

233
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,880
What do you say?!

234
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,090
Yes, I'm sorry.

235
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,840
I wonder what made her suddenly take off.

236
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,210
Geez, she got all energetic
as soon as she saw the sea.

237
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,270
So I really did see it!

238
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,540
This is...!

239
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,740
Hey, Nami! That's enough.
It's about time to tell us...

240
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,900
There's no need to explain,
is there? Look at this.

241
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,590
You recognize this, right?

242
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,720
It's not actually even a
matter of recognizing it...

243
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,070
...since we were looking
at it until this morning.

244
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,160
What's going on?!

245
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,300
Why is something from the ground
up here? It's the same thing, right?

246
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,510
No, it's not.

247
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,310
What?!

248
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,290
This is the other half of the
one we saw on the ground.

249
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,380
The other half?!

250
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,500
It's been bugging me all this time.

251
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,280
This ground is something that
shouldn't exist in the White-White Sea.

252
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,640
It was a mystery to me from the start that
this island wasn't made of "island clouds."

253
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,560
In other words, this island called Upper Yard...

254
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,240
...was originally on the ground.

255
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,450
I thought that house was strange,

256
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,920
because it had a second floor,
but there were no stairs to go up.

257
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,740
Also, there wouldn't be any reason
to build a house on a cliff like that.

258
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,620
That seashore was "a split in the island"!

259
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,470
A... Amazing!!

260
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,320
Idiots! Look closely.

261
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,060
A dreamer, huh? He does seem to be vain.

262
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,020
Why?

263
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,060
What the...?! It's just a board?!

264
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,100
This is the other half of the
island that was ripped up.

265
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,360
This island was part of Jaya!

266
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,770
Then, the island was split
into two a long time ago,

267
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,220
and one half rose into the sky.

268
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,040
But how could something like this...?

269
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,560
There's a bunch of South Birds... But why...

270
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,720
Why are they this huge?!

271
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,600
It had to be that monstrous current,

272
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,680
although it may sound silly.

273
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,900
So you're the ones that saved us?!

274
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,790
What?! He's God?!

275
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,170
My name is Montblanc Cricket.

276
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,650
Sorry I caused you trouble.

277
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,130
I thought you were just
more idiots after the gold.

278
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,850
Then there's no sky island?!

279
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,700
I know someone who said there is.

280
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,910
But he's a legendary liar!

281
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,730
No, it's not me!

282
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,280
"Noland The Liar"

283
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,280
Noland The Liar...

284
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,210
"I saw a mountain of gold
on an island in the great sea.

285
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,210
The courageous king set sail
to see if the story was true.

286
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,500
However, what they found
there was just a jungle."

287
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,040
A stupid-looking face is drawn in this book,

288
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,060
but he shed many tears
and died a regrettable death.

289
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,690
He insisted that it had submerged
due to crustal movements,

290
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,150
but everyone thought he was
making excuses out of desperation.

291
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,150
This is a duel with the man
who threw a wrench into my life.

292
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,160
That's why you kept diving
until you became sick.

293
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,620
It's not that I want to prove his innocence.

294
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,740
I want to set the record straight before I die.

295
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,260
This is indeed a man's...

296
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,430
Let's settle this, Noland!

297
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,090
♪ Take my hand... ♪

298
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,100
Don't sing!

299
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,750
The "city of gold" that once existed
on the ground and was seen by Noland

300
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,030
didn't sink into the ocean.

301
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,880
This part of Jaya has been...

302
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,620
...flying in the sky all this time!

303
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Even if we're far apart

304
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,740
I don't want you to forget

305
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:38,420
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

306
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,000
You have a friend here to share the pain

307
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:52,600
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

308
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,100
I won't let it just be a dream

309
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,820
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

310
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:13,580
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

311
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,900
Head towards the sacrificial altar!

312
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,260
Yeah! Everyone, we're on our way!

313
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,580
Hey, you two! We're not going on a picnic!

314
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,340
Don't be so touchy. Let's enjoy the trip!

315
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,810
He's right! Look, some cheerful
people're headed this way.

316
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,130
Idiot! Those’re guerrillas on the attack!

317
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,390
Whoa!

318
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,550
On the next episode of One Piece!

319
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,930
"Jaya, City of Gold in the Sky!
Head for God's Shrine!"

320
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,380
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
