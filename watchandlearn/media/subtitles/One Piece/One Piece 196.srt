00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome treasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King of
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of the
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone dreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen through
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny is
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve your
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960

tail end to the future

22
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,500
You know, though, I hear our fortress isn't
very popular lately within the Navy.

23
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,550
Yeah, I hear there're some people who call us

24
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,720
dim-witted hedgehogs made soft
by peace behind our back...

25
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,300
It's not surprising, since we've had
hardly any pirate attacks the past few years.

26
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,430
What'd you say?!

27
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,660
It wasn't me who said
that.It's a rumor! A rumor!

28
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,680
Tsk! What's their
problem?!Peace is wonderful!

32
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,820
Man, they really tore up this ship!

33
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,220
It'll probably take at
least a week to fix it.

34
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,520
Our orders are to fix it in three days.

35
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,220
Oh, man...

36
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,960
Did this ship climb a mountain or something?

37
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,150
Oh, it's you, Mechao-san.

38
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,310
That's a good way of putting it!

39
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,760
Yeah, it'd have to climb a mountain or
something to get this wrecked!

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,880
Well, you know, it
might've fallen from the sky.

41
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,110
It probably got caught around the sea
gate when entering the port.

42
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,130
Yeah, that area is very narrow,so
it's hard to pass through,

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,720
even for a navigator who's used to it.

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,780
Now, let's stop joking around and
get to work already!

45
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,770
Okay, okay...

46
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,490
Geez... Sailors these days don't have
enough love for their ships...

We've got a problem!

50
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,660
I-It appears that we've been invaded by
a huge object from the sky!

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,150
An invasion from the sky?!

52
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,380
F-From the sky, you said?!

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,880

54
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,350
An unidentified mysterious object
has invaded the base!

55
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,230
Hurry up! Guard the sea gate!

56
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,090
You guys go watch the coast!

57
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,790
Sniper Unit! Move it!

58
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,520
But I'm sleepy...

59
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,650
Close the sea gate!!

60
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,620
Over there! 4 o'clock!

61
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,920
4 o'clock! All lights on the target!!

62
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,360
P-Pirate ship...

63
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,830
The pirate flag has... a
skull with a straw hat!

64
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,100
Th-The Straw Hat Pirates?!

65
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,790
Wh-What?!

66
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,670
Ready!

67
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,440
Target the Straw Hat Pirates' ship!!

68
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,390
Did somebody say "Straw Hat"?!

69
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,980
Lt. Commander Drake!

70
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,880
The ship that has invaded our base is
the Straw Hat Pirates' ship!

71
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,420
Straw Hat, you say?!Where's
Commander Jonathan?!

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,590
Well... we can't find him.

73
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,410
Honestly, that man's...!

74
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,820
I'll be damned... To think
that someone invaded from the sky...

75
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,930
Resistance is futile! We
have you completely surrounded!

76
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,270
"Full of Power!""Carbohydrates!""Navy
Dining Hall"

77
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,500
Don't you think it's been
pretty noisy outside?

78
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,790
Yeah, I wonder if there're intruders
or something...

79
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,080
Ouch!

80
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,240
No chit-chatting!

81
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,650
Look! We have to prepare meals
for 1,000 people!

82
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,470
In two hours, a bunch of boys from
the night shift will show up!

83
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,980
There's no time for fooling around!

84
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,600
But...

85
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,970
The siren from earlier...

86
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,540
Don't worry, lads!

87
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,680
The day this fortress falls is
the day the world falls.

88
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,560
Besides, when Jessica-sama blows
up, she's a lot scarier than...

89
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,740
Jessica-sama...

90
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,130
What is it?

91
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Commander! Where have you been?!

92
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,260
I didn't catch anything today.

93
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,890
Again?!

94
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,340
But I had a large catch yesterday!

95
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,010
I'm not talking about that!Commander,
if you're always absent...

96
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,330
What's the big deal? Night fishing isn't
necessarily a waste, you know.

97
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,030
Commander, I have a report!According
to the watchmen,

98
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,710
as well as the maintenance men inside the
dock who saw the ship close by...

99
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,610
A-According to them...

100
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,070
What is it?

101
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,010
Spit it out already!

102
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,300
Yes... well... um...

103
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,770
They say they saw ghosts.

104
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,100
Like I said, something suddenly
fell from the sky!

105
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,580
A hairy monster appeared.It
jumped and then disappeared.

106
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,880
Hands... Hands...

107
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,630
What about hands?!

108
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,850
Hands grew out from my body, and
the next moment, everything went black!

109
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,930
That's right... they were
a girl's soft hands.

110
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,220
It's gotta be...

111
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,960
A ghost ship!!

112
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,810
Don't be ridiculous!

113
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,500
Yes, sir...

114
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,120
Without doubt, that is the Straw Hats' ship!

115
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,830
There's no way it's a ghost ship!

116
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,930
Moreover, of all things,to say
that it fell from the sky?!

117
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,220
Well... the part about it coming from
the sky, at least, is true.

118
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,680
I told you that it isn't a waste, didn't I?

119
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,020
Right, Lt. Commander?

120
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,960
I see...

121
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,610
A ghost ship, huh?

122
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,100
It smells good.

123
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,100
Commander! I found these in one of the rooms!

124
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,450
Ingots and a crown... Those are quite old.

125
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,890
They must've stolen them from
some ancient ruins.

126
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,360
Send them to the forensics lab!

127
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,960
Yes, sir!

128
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,740
Well then, let's explore inside, shall we?

129
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,430
Chirps?

130
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,310
That's the one. It's just an ordinary South
Bird. There's nothing to fear.

131
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,360
South Bird?

132
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,010
Yeah.

133
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,020
It's a funny bird valued highly by
old-time sailors because they always point south.

134
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,060
Hey, stop it!

135
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,120
Are you all right?!

136
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,450
So they're surprisingly violent.

137
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,120
They're well maintained.

138
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,440
Medical books and history books... huh?

139
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,150
I guess these ghosts study a lot.

140
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,480
Ghosts again? How ridiculous...

141
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,240
Thanks for your hard work. Continue the
investigation of this ghost ship.

142
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,890
Ghost ship, he says?

143
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,830
Got that?

144
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,890
Y-Yes, sir!

145
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,340
It appears that that ship stopped
by Jaya quite recently.

146
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,600
The coffee was tasty, wasn't it?

147
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,270
Yes...

148
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,310
The color and smell of
the coffee left on the deck...

149
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,500
That was definitely Jaya Coffee.

150
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,230
But you've got the courage to drink it
without investigating it well.

151
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,790
Um... Well...

152
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,610
And that South Bird... That's a
bird that inhabits the jungles of Jaya.

153
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,490
Did you know? A legend of gold remains
deeply entrenched there.

154
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,100
Commander, then that ship is...

155
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,290
I don't know about its crew's whereabouts,

156
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,790
but it's certain that it came from Jaya.

157
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,580
It's not some ghost ship.

158
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,210
Right! I've seen that ship
twice.It's the Straw Hats' ship!

159
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,050
But you, yourself, called it
a ghost ship earlier, Commander.

160
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,880
We have fresh recruits and
prisoners at this fortress.

161
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,400
If we tell everyone about the
Straw Hats' invasion

162
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,590
without knowing their true purpose,

163
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,400
it'll only cause confusion within
the fortress, right?

164
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,000
So let's just keep calling it
a ghost ship for now.

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,030
With all due respect, Commander,

166
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,200
we should organize a special investigation
unit right away

167
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,350
and search for them as soon as possible!

168
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,990
Please assign it to my unit!

169
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,650
Now, don't be so hasty.

170
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,080
But...

171
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,130
Building up our defense is the priority now.

172
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,010
You go reinforce security at the
coast as well as around the sea gate.

173
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,620
Yes, sir!

174
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,510
You go reinforce security at the ammunition
bunker, detention facilities

175
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,420
and the major passageways. I'll also grant
you authority to manage personnel.

176
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,530
Understood!

177
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,020
You look dissatisfied, Lt. Commander.

178
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,930
No, sir...

179
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,630
The night is still long.They
probably can't move around much.

180
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,650
Well, that goes for us, too.

181
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,000
Wait until morning, then take your unit

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,600
and thoroughly investigate places
where people gather.

183
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,230
Places where people gather, you say?

184
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,370
That's right!

185
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,030
It's hard to find green insects
since they live in green grassy places.

186
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,790
If the Straw Hats were
to wear our uniforms...

187
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,170
It's not that I don't
trust my men's abilities,

188
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,210
but it's very possible that
they'll take some of our uniforms.

189
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,940
Pirates are like stray
dogs...They're always hungry.

190
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,760
Why don't you start by checking the
dining hall once morning comes?

191
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,600
Yes, sir!

192
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,600
Where did everyone go?

193
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,940
What is this place?!

194
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,550
Crap!

195
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,160
Good thing we've got a waver.

196
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,360
Security is tight.

197
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,730
We'd better get out of here right away!

198
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,100
Don't tell me! This is...?!

199
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, well... We've fallen to
a troublesome place.

200
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,970
I wonder if Nami-san and
Robin-chan were able to escape okay.

201
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,350
What's the matter?!

202
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,300
Well, I saw some sort of light in the tree.

203
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,890
You were probably seeing things.

204
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,230
I can't even smoke in peace!

205
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,880
Beef, pork, chicken, beef, fish, pork...

206
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,580
Meat! Meat! Meat!!

207
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,120
No matter how I look at it, I haven't eaten
since we left the sky island!

208
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,450
Well, that didn't help.

209
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,560
If Chopper were here, he would've caught
the smell of food for me!

210
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,040
Found them!

211
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,060
Damn... We can't even get close
to the Merry like that.

212
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,910
Oreja Fleurs!

213
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,620
After all that, we couldn't
find even a single crew member.

214
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,140
Even worse, the maintenance
guys said they saw monsters, right?

215
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,320
Yeah, and the Commander clearly admitted
that this is a ghost ship.

216
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,140
How mean... asking us to watch
a creepy ship like this.

217
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,880
I see. Apparently, the Navy thinks that
the Merry is a ghost ship.

218
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,770
A ghost ship?! How rude! I'm gonna sue!!

219
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:27,340
But it's better for us, as well as
for the Merry, if they think that way.

220
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,160
We can buy time.

221
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,000
Now that I know that...

222
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,500
I get it! They must've stolen cursed
gold from some ruins!

223
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,080
Cut it out! I touched that gold...

224
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,520
Gh-Ghost!!

225
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,410
Straw Hat Luffy and Pirate Hunter Zoro...

226
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,780
We can probably assume that the
woman with countless hands

227
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,400
and the hairy monster are
also part of the group.

228
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,350
In any case, there're seven of them.

229
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,900
Among them are...

230
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,190
A skilled cook...

231
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,910
A knowledgeable ship's doctor...There
may be a historian as well...

232
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,190
I heard a suspicious noise!

233
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,610
This way! Hurry!

234
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,210
I don't know what's going on! How
do these convoluted hallways work?!

235
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,210
I'm trapped! What am I gonna
do?!What am I gonna do?!

236
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,110
What am I gonna do?!What
the heck should I do?!

237
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,820
It's downstairs!

238
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,080
Okay, got it!

239
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,290
I'm saved!

240
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,100
Now... where should I head?

241
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,080
Just as I thought...It's surrounded
by land in all directions.

242
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,580
Does that mean we fell on
a huge lake with no way out?!

243
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,740
At any rate, obtaining the information we
need to escape is our top priority.

244
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,510
Let's be resolved... Long-nose.

245
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,910
I don't want to.

246
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,480
It was just my imagination.

247
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,950
That idiot! He's got no sense of tension!

248
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,610
What I don't know is their purpose.What
on earth did they come here for?

249
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,760
Well, at any rate, my fortress is
no laughing matter.

250
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

251
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

252
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

253
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

254
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

255
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

256
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

257
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,420
Of all places, this is a Navy fortress?!

258
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,620
I'm starving!

259
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,650
We can't do anything until we
know the entire picture!

260
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,870
I'm starving!

261
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,090
Let me see your cook's spirit!

262
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,450
Are you talking to me?!

263
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,790
I said I'm starving!

264
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,770
Welcome to the fortress of Navarone!

265
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,160
Are you talking to me?

266
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

267
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,530
"Sanji the Cook! Proving His Merit
at the Navy Dining Hall!"

268
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,630
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
