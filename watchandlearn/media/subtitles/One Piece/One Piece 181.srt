00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,220
What the...?!

18
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,810
Are you familiar with a thing called
the "Sea Prism Stone," Eneru?!

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,970
Die!

20
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,820
Y-You shouldn't... I
know. It's Reject, right?

21
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,620
Your body will pay a heavy price as well!

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,290
What are you dissatisfied about?
You want Vearth, too, don't you?

23
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,490
Shut up! I'm happy to die...

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,290
...if I can take you with me!

25
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,470
D-Don't!

26
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,180
Reject!!

27
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,320
Hold our true motive in your
hearts and speak not of it.

28
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,490
We are the ones who weave history.

29
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,570
Those are the words that were
written on a Poneglyph 800 years ago.

30
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,710
Poneglyph?

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,340
When those who were
after the stone appeared,

32
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,590
the warriors of Shandora,
the city of gold, fought bravely.

33
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,490
Did they win?

34
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,950
Yes, they did.

35
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,310
However, the battle was so fierce
that it took a great toll on them.

36
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,600
After that, the few who
survived became guards

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,040
who quietly watched over the
wrecked city and the Poneglyph.

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,860
And those were our immediate ancestors, huh?

39
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,940
But the island flew up to
Skypiea 400 years ago.

40
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,160
And it was taken away by Skypieans.

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,280
Our ancestors tried so
hard to protect the land.

42
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,870
And it was taken away!

43
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,580
Upper Yard is our homeland,
and at the same time,

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,660
it also holds an important history that
disappeared into the darkness of time.

45
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,090
Even though it is in the sky right now,

46
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,940
we must not allow the fire of the
proud city of Shandora to die out!

47
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,730
"Ambition Toward the Endless Vearth--
The Ark Maxim!!"

48
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,910
Robin!

49
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,490
Weird knight!

50
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,540
Hey...

51
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,840
Don't tell me...

52
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,640
He's compressing his own heart?!

53
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,600
It's not that people fear God.

54
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,990
Fear itself is God.

55
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,150
What the hell... is with this guy?!

56
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,120
Warrior Wyper. I told you, didn't I?

57
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,460
That you shouldn't...

58
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,630
See, I told you.

59
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,910
How pitiful...

60
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,370
...Warrior Wyper!

61
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,420
Don't address me...

62
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,590
...so casually!!

63
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:48,040
800 years ago, proud Shandian
warriors fought for the fate of this city.

64
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,270
We are their descendants!

65
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,660
One day, our homeland
was suddenly taken away.

66
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,880
We've been carrying on Great Warrior
Calgara's injured pride for 400 years.

67
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,460
We single-mindedly sought
this place for generations.

68
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,690
I finally made it!!

69
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,130
You are... in my way!

70
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,630
You got me good there, Wyper.

71
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,670
What a cheap trick,
using that Sea Prism Stone.

72
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,530
On top of that, one shot of Reject
should be suicidal for an ordinary person.

73
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,930
You shot it twice and still
get back up... Impressive...

74
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,730
However, you are no match for me.

75
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,030
The drum became... a bird!

76
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,100
30 million volt... Hino!!

77
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,020
So this has a Sea Prism Stone in it!

78
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,530
You too? Swordsman from the Blue Sea...

79
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,560
It's kill or be killed, right?!

80
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,030
Kiten!

81
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,410
Zoro!!

82
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,190
I don't believe it...! Even Zoro!

83
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,250
Everyone was... taken out!

84
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,840
Why...?

85
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,520
When he is that hurt, he still...

86
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,630
He still intends to fight?

87
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,940
Why do you get up?

88
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,040
You will die anyway. Isn't it
easier on you if you don't fight?

89
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,830
400 years, you said?

90
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,580
Since you Shandians started
fighting to take back your homeland?

91
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,310
However, you are the only
warrior who made it here.

92
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,270
Also, soon this nation
will fall to the Blue Sea.

93
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,720
God can't...

94
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,180
At this point, your struggling
is nothing but an eyesore.

95
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,180
This guy can't be defeated by anyone!!

96
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,700
Why do you get up?

97
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,500
For the sake of our ancestors!

98
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,700
I expected a better answer than that.

99
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,270
You probably aren't even
completely conscious.

100
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,680
El Thor!

101
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,050
You're the only one left.

102
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,110
I...

103
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,850
I... Please take me with you!

104
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,130
I'll come with you!

105
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,140
The dream world!

106
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,840
No...?

107
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,070
Wyper...

108
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,960
Wyper, come here.

109
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,330
What is it?

110
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,180
Since you are a descendent of the
Great Warrior Calgara, I'll tell you this.

111
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:21,180
Another reason why he wanted to
take back the homeland at all costs.

112
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,700
Another... reason?

113
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,910
That's right. That is the
biggest frustration to Calgara.

114
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,490
Listen. The Great Warrior Calgara had...

115
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,300
What's the matter? Did you change your mind?

116
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,040
Y-Yes! Um, no... I'm coming!

117
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,270
Oh? Are you going to bring that with you?

118
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:04,360
Oh... Well, if I can't, then...

119
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,910
I don't think you can use it
where we are heading to,

120
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,240
but that's okay. Do what you want.

121
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,550
Th-Thank you very much!
I-I really like this, so...

122
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,590
Are you concerned about them?

123
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,180
Oh, no...!

124
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,910
You don't have to act so formal.

125
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:46,730
They were just fools who couldn't
understand the power of God,

126
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,140
unlike you.

127
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Really, a mind that
cannot be controlled by fear

128
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,280
can also be troublesome
sometimes... Don't you agree?

129
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,500
Y-Yes... You're right.

130
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,210
I can't let him notice.

131
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,470
I have no choice but to obey him.

132
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,090
An opportunity to escape will
definitely come somewhere!

133
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,300
Until then...

134
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,490
What could be so far back in here?

135
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,360
Excuse me...

136
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,170
Just be quiet and follow me.

137
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,350
Wha...? This is...

138
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,770
What do you think? Isn't it amazing?
There is only one in the world.

139
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,830
This is a ship that can
be controlled only by me.

140
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,750
In other words, it's powered by lightning.

141
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,350
That's possible?

142
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,320
It's natural that you are surprised.

143
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,050
But it's possible.
All it requires is my abundant energy

144
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,060
and a material that can
automatically transmit

145
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,960
the necessary amount of that energy.

146
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,690
A material that can transmit energy?

147
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,550
That's right. The gold that
lay waiting on this island.

148
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,290
The people who live on
this island should be happy,

149
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:09,670
since they get to see a very rare
flying ship before they die.

150
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,390
A flying ship?! I can't believe it!

151
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,800
If it really flies, I won't
have any chance to escape!

152
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,340
"God"

153
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,010
This is the Ark Maxim.

154
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,550
With this ship, we will reach
the endless land, Endless Vearth!!

155
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,880
We're outside... We finally made it out...

156
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,030
This is stone ground...
I wonder what this place is...

157
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,690
Did you see something?!

158
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,200
Hey!

159
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,180
Luffy!

160
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,880
We're out!!

161
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,320
We made it out!!

162
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,110
Look! Where are we? It looks like ruins.

163
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,110
So it's here? The huge golden bell?

164
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,240
Could this place be... our homeland?

165
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,250
Oh, yeah? You guys are amazing!

166
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,840
Oh? What's that? There's a huge hole...

167
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,280
Luffy! Wait! What is it this time?!

168
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,250
Where're you going?!

169
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,270
Zoro! Hey! What're you doing?!

170
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,930
How could this happen...
when you were here?!

171
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,040
Nami...! Where's Nami?! She's not here!!

172
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,290
Wyper!

173
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,270
Even Wyper...!

174
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,010
That bazooka guy...
He's really strong, but even so...

175
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,670
Who did this to everyone?!

176
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,340
It's Eneru!

177
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,770
He's the only one...

178
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,370
...who could do something like this.

179
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,760
Eneru... is he that God guy?

180
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,730
Yes... My Mantra didn't work
while we were inside the snake,

181
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,860
so I don't know what happened here, but...

182
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,410
Robin!

183
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,200
Navigator... was taken.

184
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,130
H-Hey, wait! Take your time!

185
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,890
So Nami was taken by the God guy? Where?!

186
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,530
I don't know.

187
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:01,620
Listen carefully... The way things stand,
this nation, Skypiea, will disappear.

188
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,570
The sky island will?!

189
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,940
Our village, too?!

190
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,190
Everything...

191
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,680
He said that he'd return
everyone in the sky to the ground.

192
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,760
Then Eneru will definitely
show up where the golden bell is?

193
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,090
Yes. You'll see him there for sure.

194
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,900
But if you wander around
looking for them and miss them,

195
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,130
there'll be no going back...

196
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,500
Don't worry!

197
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,580
I know where they are.
Two voices are moving on this island.

198
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,030
It must be Nami and Eneru!

199
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,830
Aisa...

200
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,620
Take me there!!

201
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,810
Racing full speed ahead as always

202
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,560
A to Z, we run through it

203
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,360
We all have worries and fall many times

204
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,280
But we just need to rise to the top someday

205
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:31,750
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

206
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,810
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

207
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,310
I never treat you "bad"

208
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,010
How many times did we fall?

209
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:55,100
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

210
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Smile! Come back to you, friends

211
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,450
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

212
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,370
Come back to you, friends

213
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,210
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

214
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,910
Come back to you, friends

215
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,430
I'm truly annoyed. So my
prophecy did not come true.

216
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,310
Luffy!

217
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:35,840
So you're that Eneru guy?
What're you doing to my friends?!

218
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,500
Watch your mouth! I am God.

219
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,880
You're not at all like God!!

220
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

221
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,350
"They Finally Clash!
Pirate Luffy vs. God Eneru!!"

222
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
