00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,970
My treasure?

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,820
If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,960
Find it!

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,380
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,680
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,650
and set out in search
of something to find

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,440
ONE PIECE!

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,370
Compasses only cause delays

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,860
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,760
If the dusty treasure map

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,810
has been verified,

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,200
it's not a legend!

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,260
When it comes to personal storms,

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn't there!

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,540
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,490
We are, We are on the cruise!

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,800
We are!

28
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,020
Wealth, fame, power...

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,750
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,150
My treasure?

34
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,380
If you want it, you can have it!

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,740
Find it!

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,830
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,350
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

39
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,480
You bastard...

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,060
Are you mocking me?

41
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,020
Whoa... I'd expect no less from you.

42
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,810
If you're in that much of a hurry,
I'll show you...

43
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,610
...my new powers.

44
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,570
It's collapsing!

45
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,100
Oh, shoot!

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,590
I was gonna stop the transformation

47
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,580
when I reached my human-beast form,
but I became a giraffe!

48
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,040
A talking giraffe is falling towards us!

49
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,870
Kaku!

50
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,550
That power of yours is too cool!

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
A wolf?!

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,380
What is this place?! A zoo?!

53
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,890
How dare you all...?

54
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,470
Experience the fighting
power of a power holder...!

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,390
Tempest Kick!

56
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,050
Whoa! What's that?!

57
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,570
He's gonna do something!

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,700
Sky Slicer!

59
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,700
This isn't good.

60
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,580
Duck, Usopp!

61
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,960
"I Won't Kick Even If It Costs
Me My Life! Sanji's Chivalry!"

62
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,370
I see...

63
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,240
The point is the length--
in other words, the reach.

64
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,090
With the power coming from that huge
body in addition to centrifugal force,

65
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,060
his attack is deeper
and sharper than before.

66
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,700
Wh-What the heck?!

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,850
Hey, I don't see any damage.

68
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,130
Look at the ceiling.

69
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,010
Huh? The ceiling?

70
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,730
Oh?

71
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,720
I can see the blue sky.

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,670
Whoa...

73
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,150
I wonder why... Hm...?

74
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Don't tell me the Tower
of Law has been cut in two!

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,650
Hey, hey, hey, hey...!

76
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,940
This is dangerous!

77
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,780
How shameful!

78
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,620
To think that you showed
your emotions in a battle!

79
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,110
Shut up.

80
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,410
I like being a giraffe.

81
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,580
I love giraffes.

82
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,090
Even if your attacks are sharp,

84
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,430
that's not threatening to me at all.

85
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,260
S-Stop it, Zoro!

86
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,810
That hurts! What're you doing?!

87
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,130
Why are you pulling my arm?!

88
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,220
Huh...? Pulling my arm?

89
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,270
Whoa! It's locked tight!

90
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,760
Yeah, it is.

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,500
Hey! What're you doing?!

92
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,370
It's not my fault, is it?!

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,390
This happened because you charged at me!

94
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,630
I did that because you were standing
there in a daze when he attacked!

95
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,340
Just unlock these handcuffs!

96
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,260
What're those guys doing?

97
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,260
Beats me.

98
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,920
To put it simply,

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,320
this means that we're
in the same situation as Robin is.

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
Then, the key is...

101
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,910
...in the hands of one
of the CP9 members.

102
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,310
We have no choice but to get
the key by defeating them.

103
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,530
Don't be unreasonable!
There's no way we can fight like this!

104
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,290
Our prey got connected.

105
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,980
Okay then, Jabra.

106
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,530
Just stay back
and leave those two to me.

107
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,100
What?! Are you trying to steal my prey?!

108
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,750
Then, do you want us to work
together and fight them?

109
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,260
Even if it costs me my life,
the answer is no.

110
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,340
Me, neither.

111
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,600
Hey, you two!

112
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,010
Tell us the number on those handcuffs.

113
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,840
Number?

114
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,830
The handcuffs and the keys have numbers

115
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,470
so that we know which key
unlocks which handcuffs.

116
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,820
If those handcuffs can be unlocked
by one of the keys we have,

117
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,390
we'll unlock them right away.

118
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,080
What?! Really?!

119
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,520
The number... Where's the number?

120
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,800
Here it is! It's 2!

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,050
Unlock these!

122
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,650
Not the right one.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,420
Mine isn't, either.

124
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,200
Sorry.

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,160
What?! You got my hopes up, you jerks!

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,340
Dammit!

127
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,870
Then, it means one of the other three
CP9 members has the right one, huh?

128
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,040
It can't be helped.

129
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,860
The early bird gets to kill the worm.

130
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,420
Seems like that's the only way.

131
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,550
What?!

132
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,750
What?!

133
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,560
Whoa! What's with these stairs?!

134
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,120
They're sliced in two and shifted.

135
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,730
The impact from earlier...

136
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,200
As I suspected,
something must've happened.

137
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,680
Is this building okay?

138
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,740
Hey! Are you okay?!

139
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,260
Ah! Zoro! Sogeking!

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,270
Ah! Hey! Chopper!

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,180
What's going on? They're waving to me.

142
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,020
It looks kinda fun.

143
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,190
H-Hey, guys!

144
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,130
Idiot!

145
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,830
Pay attention to these handcuffs!

146
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,740
Find the key for handcuffs #2!

147
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,200
Huh? A key?

148
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,300
What the hell is this?!

149
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,050
I just assumed that there'd
be a bridge or something.

150
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,180
What crazy huge swirls!

151
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,040
I can see the Gates of Justice now,

152
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,060
but is it possible to go
there on a regular boat?

153
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,720
I don't have much time anyway.

154
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,190
I guess I'll try something.

155
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,900
Here we go!

156
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,360
Just wait, Robin!

157
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,240
Yaay! Yaay!

158
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,440
I've found the path to those gates!

159
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm gonna tell everyone!

160
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,000
Ooops!

161
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,700
That was close!

162
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,160
What's this?

163
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,290
Stare...

164
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,050
Stare...

165
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,060
Th-This is...

166
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,140
Don't tell me...

167
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,730
Click.

168
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,020
Ahhh! What's going on?!

169
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,150
All right!

170
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,850
I found another secret passage!

171
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,680
Yaay!

172
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,170
Where are we?!

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,580
Whoa! Pirate guy!

174
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,420
What're you doing?!

175
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,230
I see.

176
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,440
So the handcuffs and the keys
have numbers on them.

177
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,160
What?!

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,990
That's what's happening here?

179
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,660
Then I'll fight those guys!

180
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't be ridiculous!

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,970
There are
two of them! If you get taken out,

182
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,050
with these handcuffs on, we won't
be able to do anything but get killed!

183
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,100
Please! You're our only hope!

184
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,250
Hope?

185
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,090
It's not like I'm
happy to hear that, you jerk!

186
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,540
Sanji, Nami, and Franky...

187
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,490
If any of them
get the #2 key, bring it here right away!

188
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,140
We're counting on you!

189
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,010
The one who's likely to get
the key first is... Maybe Sanji?

190
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
I'll go look for Sanji.

191
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,540
I'm their only hope!

192
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Now...

193
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,700
...I've caught you!

194
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,210
Let me go!

195
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
Yoyoi!

196
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,280
Just...

197
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,650
give up!

198
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,760
Die!

199
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,770
I'm no match for him at all!

200
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,760
Franky...

201
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,160
Iron Body!

202
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,530
...Boxing!

203
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,330
Shave!

204
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,740
What's with your punches?

205
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,710
You're no ordinary human!

206
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,770
No matter how much you harden
your body to make it like iron,

207
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,850
my fists are real iron.

208
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,890
N-No!

209
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,770
This is no time for having tea!

210
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Witchcraft!

211
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,440
I was drawn in by your witchcraft!

212
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,240
I almost got swept up in a
high tide called "love trap"!

213
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,780
You've already had three cups.

214
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,220
Shut up, witch!

215
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm not gonna
be caught in a trap again!

216
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,170
CP9 insulted Robin-chan
terribly on the sea train.

217
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,710
I'm not gonna forget about it.

218
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,680
Now...

219
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,020
give me the key!

220
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,090
That's too bad...

221
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,710
It seems like you're in a hurry.

222
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,760
Go ahead and take the key.

223
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,900
Where is it?

224
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,860
Well...

225
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,490
Where on my body do you think I hid it?

226
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,200
Why don't you try finding it?

227
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,370
I'd be happy to!

228
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,090
That was a bad start, huh?

229
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,050
You stupid Sanji.

230
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,920
Nico Robin is steadily
approaching the Gates of Justice

231
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,330
while we're here fighting like this.

232
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,540
Or maybe should I say that from
her perspective, she's approaching hell?

233
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,690
I know that.

234
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
That's right.

235
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,750
Robin-chan's life is at stake!

236
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,810
If you're gonna be in my way,

237
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,930
I won't go easy on you,
even if you are a woman!

238
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,260
Hand over that key to me
before you get hurt!

239
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,730
Even if you shout,
the key won't turn up.

240
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,440
You don't have to treat me
like I'm a woman.

241
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,860
I don't live in such a delicate world.

242
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,160
Since we've got an annihilation order,

243
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,820
I'll just take your life,
that's all.

244
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,330
I won't let you take my life.

245
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,070
What I want is...

246
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,710
...the key to Robin-chan's handcuffs.

247
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,640
Then I guess teatime is over?

248
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,890
Shave!

249
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,770
Your power is indeed
that of a superhuman.

250
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,990
An opening!

251
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,500
I landed a blow.

252
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,550
Ow!

253
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,060
Hey! How could you?!

254
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,770
Isn't that what you call
"landing a blow"?

255
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,480
How dare you...? You little...

256
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,730
Moon Walk!

257
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,170
He's fast!

258
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,220
I've just stomped you.

259
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,650
That means you lost!

260
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,190
Now, give the key to...

261
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,060
Finger Pistol!

262
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,270
Tempest Kick!

263
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,950
What a disappointing guy.

264
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,190
You're a pirate...

265
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,840
...and yet, you're quite the coward!

266
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,290
Hey, shut up!

267
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,370
Give me the key!

268
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,570
I've had enough of your
transparent threats.

269
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,800
Shall I try something fun on you?

270
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,850
Unless you fight back,
you won't survive.

271
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,520
He's not coming after me...

272
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,360
Good!

273
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,350
If I had gotten caught again,
I would've been killed.

274
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,820
I'll just run and...

275
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,030
Life Return!

276
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,870
Yoyoi! Yoi! Yoi! Yoyoi!

277
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,130
Oh, shoot!

278
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,840
Now, shall I...

279
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,980
...pierce you to death

280
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,300
or choke you to death?!

281
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,220
In this life, a cold wintry wind blows.

282
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,110
You will die here peacefully
before the spring comes.

283
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,830
I'll at least let you bloom

284
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,240
in lovely bright red petals
one more time

285
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
before you fall!

286
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,050
That's my compassion!

287
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,700
When you arrive in the afterlife,

288
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,640
please tell my late mother...

289
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,040
...that I'm... I'm doing fine...

290
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,100
killing people!

291
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,810
Now, die!

292
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,730
Now... Now... Now!

293
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,490
No!

294
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,980
Song of Spring Feeling!

295
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,150
Hoofprint... Roseo!

296
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,550
Nami! Are you okay?!

297
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,840
Chopper...

298
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,680
Thanks. You saved me.

299
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,640
What's with that guy?

300
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,930
Is he a power holder?

301
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,150
I don't know.

302
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,940
His hair moves like
an octopus, so I can't do anything.

303
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,250
More importantly,
now is our chance, Chopper.

304
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,780
Let's get out of here right away.

305
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,270
Why?!

306
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,330
Unless we defeat him,
we can't get the key.

307
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,560
You mean this, right?

308
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,260
I stole the key without him noticing,
but I just couldn't get away from him.

309
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,060
Do you know what's going on
with the others?

310
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,010
Say, Nami.

311
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,420
What number does it have on it?

312
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,000
Number?

313
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,320
It says 3.

314
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,410
Wrong one.

315
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,130
What is this number?

316
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,350
Something fell down!

317
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,320
Is this... a doll?!

318
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,810
No...

319
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,520
Sanji!

320
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,080
Why does he look like this?!

321
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,100
Sanji!

322
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,570
Hey! What happened?!

323
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,270
Why is your body like this?!

324
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,320
Are you okay, Sanji-kun?!

325
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,000
Sanji!

326
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,810
Sorry... I lost.

327
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,470
I couldn't get the key.

328
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,130
Hold on a sec, Sanji.
I'll give you first aid.

329
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,930
I never thought that Sanji-kun
would get taken out...

330
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,030
Sanji-kun...

331
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,290
Were you really
not able to defeat her?

332
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,690
Did you really fight seriously?

333
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,260
It was that woman
who you fought, wasn't it?

334
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,750
You're soft with women.

335
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,500
I'm sorry about the key.

336
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,900
That's not it!

337
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,950
I'm saying that because
of that stupid chivalry,

338
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,420
you're gonna lose your life!

339
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,420
You're gonna stick to it even
after getting hurt like this?!

340
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,140
What're you gonna do if you die?!

341
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,260
It's not like...

342
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,160
I want to die.

343
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,400
But I grew up having the idea that
I shouldn't kick women beat into me.

344
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,480
So...

345
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,740
even if it costs me my life...

346
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,440
...I won't kick a woman!

347
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,830
You're a fool.

348
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Fool!

349
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,750
Hey! What're you doing, Nami?!

350
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,940
If running away is also
against your chivalry,

351
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,960
at least ditch that chivalry!

352
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,960
It's not worth dying in vain over.

353
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,970
Leave that woman to me.

354
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,310
Also...

355
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,930
I think a little more of
your chivalry than I did before.

356
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,000
What?!

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,140
Did she just say
that she loves me more?

358
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,640
No, she didn't!

359
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,860
I'm not kind.

360
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,690
Neither am I.

361
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,570
Sounds like we can get along.

362
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,580
Hey! Don't you wanna save Nico Robin?!

363
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,900
Hurry up and get me the cola!

364
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,270
I haven't forgiven you yet!

365
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,550
Just do it already!

366
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,890
If I have cola, I can power up!

367
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,110
What kind of idiot actually
gets stronger with cola?!

368
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,540
Shut up! That'd be me!

369
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,400
Just watch.

370
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,020
I'll finish him off in an instant!

371
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,700
On the next episode of One Piece!

372
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,150
"Fukurou's Miscalculation!
My Cola Is the Water of Life"

373
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,350
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
