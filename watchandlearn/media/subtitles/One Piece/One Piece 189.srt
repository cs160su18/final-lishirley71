2
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,190
The commodore seems sad...

18
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,860
Yeah. Just after he made such a
great friend all the way out here...

19
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,850
None of this makes any sense!

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,080
We set sail first thing tomorrow morning...

21
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,270
But the villagers are so
bloodthirsty we can't go near 'em,

22
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,830
not to mention, the bell
didn't ring again today...

23
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,650
Don't show your face around me!

24
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,900
Do you want your wife to end up a widow?!

25
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,780
"Eternal Friends! The Vowed Bell
Echoes Across the Mighty Seas!!"

26
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,190
What a heartrending way to leave...

27
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,130
Umm...

28
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,120
Doctor...

29
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,040
Mousse-chan?!

30
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,770
Do you have a minute?

31
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,730
Botanist, my ass!

32
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,270
Noland!

33
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,510
If these are the victims
of your "advancements,"

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,240
then we should never have accepted you!

35
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,970
Kindred Trees?

36
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,680
Yes.

37
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,150
It is said that all the spirits of our
ancestors who died on this island

38
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,760
are guided to them by the bell
so they can settle inside them.

39
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,490
All of our ancestors who lived on
the island since the age of Shandora

40
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:13,260
watch over us from those sacred, white trees.

41
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,260
The Kindred Woods are so
truly important to us Shandians

42
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,290
that we've protected them as much
as we've protected our own lives!

43
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,660
And we chopped them all down...

44
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,590
The warriors were angry and
instantly took up their weapons...

45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,950
We must drive them off this island!

46
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,030
Yeah!

47
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,240
...but since you had saved so
many of the villagers' lives...

48
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,720
I see. So that attitude was
anger they couldn't act on...

49
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,180
Even if it was just for tree research...

50
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,400
Even if you didn't know...

51
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,520
The villagers' anger won't go away now...

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,500
So, I thought I would at least ask why...

53
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,080
...before you left...

54
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,870
Hey! Someone help with this!

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,860
Trees where ancestors' spirits dwell...

56
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,150
Get it all on board now!

57
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,450
I had no idea. We've done something
that can never be taken back...

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,750
The villagers are right to be angry.

59
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,080
But, Commodore! We had no choice, given--

60
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,610
No excuses! I only did what satisfied me!

61
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,350
I'm told that aside from
proclaiming the city's existence,

62
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,790
that bell also served to guide
their ancestors' spirits to the island.

63
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,780
And we cut down those trees!

64
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,720
We have no reason to be forgiven!

65
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,150
Commodore...

66
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,100
Listen up, everyone!

67
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,850
Eh?! Leave all the gold behind?!

68
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,790
Noland and his men are preparing to leave.

69
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,840
Mousse! Where were you?!

70
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,210
What if...

71
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,630
What if you knew a single, important
tree was tainted by poison...

72
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,290
And that its poison would
eventually spread into the forest,

73
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,790
affect people, and kill an island?!

74
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,120
What if you knew beforehand?!

75
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,550
What are you talking about?!

76
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,810
What do you mean?

77
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,510
If it was us...

78
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,890
What would we do with
that single, important tree?!

79
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,270
Dad! Go quickly and stop them!

80
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,550
Don't be a fool! You know what they've done!

81
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,490
If we part now, we'll regret it
for the rest of our lives!

82
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,460
You finally made such a dear friend,

83
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,920
and we Shandians owe them so much!

84
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,380
But we're going to leave them
hurt for the rest of their lives!

85
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,590
What are you talking about?!

86
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,120
It'll probably sound like an excuse,

87
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,290
but for the commodore's honor, I must say this.

88
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,920
Those woods of yours were already dead.

89
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,830
Eh?!

90
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,870
The true horror of the Kinetsu plague
is that it can also infect plant life.

91
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,750
It was because he knew this

92
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,450
that the commodore pleaded with
you without regard for his own life.

93
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,760
From people to forest, forest to people...

94
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,870
Several small islands have been
destroyed in exactly that way.

95
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,920
But there's nothing to worry about now.

96
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,880
We finished checking
the entire forest yesterday.

97
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,050
I'm sorry that we cut
down your beloved woods

98
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,430
without knowing or explaining...

99
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,400
It'd probably still be unforgivable
even with an explanation,

100
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,550
but a botanist would never harm
a forest without good reason.

101
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,150
The commodore doesn't hate
gods and spirits and stuff...

102
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,060
It's just that he always
knows what's most important.

103
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,320
That means... they did it for us?

104
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,290
Dad!

105
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,420
I'm sorry, Noland!

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,730
Don't go yet!

107
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,720
Everyone have everything?

108
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,110
All except one thing...

109
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,180
Quit mopin'! Just forget about it!

110
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,900
All right! It's time to go!
Everyone to your positions!

111
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,020
We're now heading back
to the Lvneel Kingdom!

112
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,870
Noland!

113
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,040
I've committed such a sin!

114
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,840
Wait! Noland!

115
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,220
Set sail!

116
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,210
Why is the bell ringing?

117
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,110
Ring it!

118
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,930
I'm sorry, Noland-san!

119
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,430
Louder! So Noland and the others can hear it!

120
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,860
Commodore! Look!

121
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,180
Noland!

122
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,550
Calgara...

123
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,520
Come back again!

124
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,160
Noland...

125
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,650
I'll be waiting for you here!

126
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,870
I'll keep on ringing the bell!

127
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,330
So that your ship won't get
lost at sea when you return...

128
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,290
So that you won't lose sight
of this island during a storm...

129
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,570
I'll ring this bell and wait for you!

130
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,600
Let's meet again someday
for sure! Friend of mine!

131
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,700
I can... come back again?

132
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,050
Of course I'll be back! I will!

133
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,870
Let's meet again someday for sure!

134
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,310
There once was a man
named Montblanc Noland,

135
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,530
"North Blue-- Lvneel Kingdom"

136
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,130
from a kingdom in the northern seas.

137
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:07,090
Noland the Explorer always told
stories of incredible adventures.

138
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:13,270
But the villagers could never
tell if they were true or not.

139
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,310
One day, Noland returned from a
journey and reported to the king.

140
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,120
It stands all the more
proudly and beautifully in ruin!

141
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,550
This city is named Shandora! The term
"city of gold" fits it like none other!

142
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,960
"Five Years Later"

143
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,020
Marie Jois has finally granted us
permission to enter the Grand Line.

144
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,680
As such, I wish to send
you on another mission.

145
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,350
Yes, it would be my pleasure!

146
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:49,150
But, I've decided my soldiers will
join you on this journey, as will I.

147
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,260
Understood?

148
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,270
Yes!

149
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,450
"One Year Before Noland's Arrival"

150
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,990
Calgara!

151
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,910
Seto...

152
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,940
You're off to ring the bell, right? I'll help!

153
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,680
Hey, Nola. You've sure settled into these ruins!

154
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,470
Say! When do you suppose
Noland-san and the others will come?

155
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,440
That's all you ever ask when you come here.

156
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,410
It won't be so easy for him to come back.

157
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,800
He was born in the far northern seas.
He also has a family back home.

158
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,590
But he did promise.

159
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,550
As long as we keep ringing this
bell here, he'll show up sooner or later.

160
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,050
What's this?! This looks bad!

161
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,870
Come, Seto! We have to protect the village!

162
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,930
Why?!

163
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,150
Why does the island suddenly end here?!

164
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,710
Damn you! You lied to me!

165
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,180
Where is this gold of yours?!

166
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,420
Where did the village go?!

167
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,770
What happened to this island?!

168
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,380
Calgara! If you're alive, let me hear it!
The sound of the gold bell!

169
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,570
Answer me, fire of Shandora!

170
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,960
Noland's public execution's about to start!

171
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
Hey! This way, guys!

172
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,120
Six years ago,

173
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,390
I saw a giant city of gold on
the Grand Line island of Jaya!

174
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,240
The city of gold does exist!

175
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,660
Then let's hear from one of your crewmen.

176
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,670
Is this man telling the truth?

177
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,480
No. It's an absolute lie.

178
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,720
Eh?! Noland-san is a liar?!

179
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,190
Then were all his stories fake?!

180
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,970
That's messed up! He lied to the
whole kingdom and acted like a hero!

181
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,150
Who's that witness?!
He's not part of our crew!

182
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,150
Did you see Calgara and the others?!

183
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,990
Commodore! What happened?!

184
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,740
Seize them!

185
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,670
Dammit!

186
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,730
Men...

187
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,320
For his heinous lies, Montblanc
Noland is hereby sentenced

188
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,070
to death by beheading!

189
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,800
Liar!

190
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,100
Liar!

191
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,360
He's a liar!

192
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,540
The commodore'd never lie!

193
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,840
Commodore!

194
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:09,700
Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!...

195
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,200
God! It's a giant island of Vearth!

196
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,630
Yes. Did you hear that? The singing
voice of this beautiful Vearth...

197
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:07,070
It is truly the birth of holy land.
That is where I must live!

198
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,760
What happened?!

199
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,430
What is this?! I can't breathe well!

200
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,200
Is everyone all right?!

201
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,210
Pull yourselves together!

202
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,910
Pull yourselves together!

203
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,770
Tend to the wounded! Hurry!

204
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,110
Calgara! Intruders!

205
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,650
I hereby claim this Vearth as mine! I am God!

206
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,960
God, my ass!

207
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,550
Stop them, warriors!

208
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,320
We cannot let this land be taken away!

209
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,380
We made a promise, Noland...

210
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,120
That we would meet again someday...

211
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,130
Calgara... Where are you?!

212
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:58,740
When you return to Jaya, what will
you think when you see we're gone?

213
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:05,190
Hold on a little longer! I'll let
you know that "we are here"!

214
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
Are you alive?!

215
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,610
I have so much to tell you...

216
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,830
Calgara...

217
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,170
I'm only concerned for your well-being...

218
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,640
Let's meet again on the
same land someday, Noland!

219
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,160
Light the fire of Shandora!

220
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,830
Great Warrior Calgara continued to shout.

221
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,590
Just once would've been enough.

222
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,370
For he believed the fire of Shandora
would echo and let all know that,

223
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,900
"We are here!"

224
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,130
But the bell never once rang.

225
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,870
Everything was later told to our
village by sailors from the Blue Sea.

226
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,170
Noland, to whom we owe so much,
had such pride for our city

227
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:04,820
that he refused to deny Shandora's
existence and died known as a liar.

228
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,380
But it was already too late,

229
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,870
for Great Warrior Calgara had died
honorably in battle here in the sky.

230
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,770
Never being able to convey his message...

231
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,460
That is Great Warrior Calgara's greatest regret.

232
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,310
Do you think it could still reach him?

233
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,060
That bell! If we rang it now,
would its sound reach Noland?!

234
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,610
That's a good question...

235
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,690
We are close to Heaven...

236
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,270
Wyper! We'll die if we don't escape now!

237
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,740
Come on!

238
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,270
Wyper...

239
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,730
Eneru...

240
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,160
What gives you the right
to take everything away?!

241
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,060
This is the sky! God's domain!

242
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,690
Everything is an eyesore!

243
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,020
The people, the trees, the land!
Return to where you belong!

244
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,370
Let everything rain into the Blue Sea!

245
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,810
Hurry!

246
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,960
Angel Island won't last much longer!

247
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,470
There are lots of injured people!

248
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,870
Get them into boats, then give them first aid!

249
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,110
Run!

250
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,390
Hurry, into the ocean!

251
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,370
Hurry!

252
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,230
I get chills when I imagine that
girl's speech being any later!

253
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,100
Is she all right?!

254
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,590
He's far above now.

255
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,860
It's only a matter of time until
his ship reaches the top of the vine.

256
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,170
What is it Eneru wants there?

257
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,480
A gold bell at the top.

258
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,270
A bell...

259
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:09,580
The scurrying angels are like a
line of ants that's been disturbed!

260
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,750
Return to where you belong, Skypiea!

261
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,510
What is that?!

262
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,470
A hole in the White-White Sea?!

263
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,710
I have no need for good
old God's Shrine either!

264
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,760
Nor for the city of Shandora below it!

265
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,270
There is but one thing left
in this land that I want!

266
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,270
The golden grand belfry!

267
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,470
Two voices, at this final stage?

268
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,440
Geez! How can he run so fast?!

269
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,080
Nami! Be all right!

270
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,090
And I won't let you have
the golden bell, Eneru!

271
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

272
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

273
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

274
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

275
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

276
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

277
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

278
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

279
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,960
Now, then! Time for that eyesore
of an island to disappear!

280
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,350
What's that?! The clouds are changing shape!

281
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,500
I won't let you have your way, Eneru!

282
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,220
There is no stopping this Raigo!

283
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,850
We have to escape, too!

284
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,180
If I can just catch him...!

285
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

286
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,020
"Angel Island Obliterated!
The Horror of the Raigo's Advent!!"

287
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
