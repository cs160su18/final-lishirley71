2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,990
Luffy has returned to Marineford
with Rayleigh and Jimbei.

60
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,600
What is the real reason behind their actions?

61
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,190
"With Hopes It Will Reach My
Friends! Big News Spreading Fast!"

62
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,380
On the solitary island in the Grand Line...

63
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,890
Since they locked you up,

64
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,730
we couldn't even sleep at night
and in order to save you...

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,690
...We went east and west and
survived various hardships!

66
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,890
And then,

67
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,070
our captain who should be in prison
became a hero in the newspaper!

68
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,450
--Captain Buggy!
--We've been looking for you!

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,420
We've trusted and followed
you and we thought,

70
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,980
"Look at him, New World! That's our captain!"

71
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,720
I-I didn't know that you guys
had that much trust in me...

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,970
I missed you all!

73
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,920
Captain Buggy!

74
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
You guys...

75
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,240
Didn't you give up on Buggy?

76
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,170
So this is how it will be, guys!

77
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,090
I'm the first mate of the
Buggy Pirates - Mohji!

78
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,670
Brother Mohji!

79
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,930
I'm the chief of staff - Cabaji!

80
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,680
Brother Cabaji!

81
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,140
And he's my buddy - Richie!

82
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,390
Richie!

83
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,610
By the way, what they said
in the newspaper was true.

84
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,540
They're all infamous criminals
with high bounties!

85
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,330
Of course! They're heinous
prisoners from Impel Down!

86
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,120
Oh yeah!

87
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,130
Hey Alvida, do you wanna see something cool?

88
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,960
Ta-dah!

89
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,760
This is...!

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,070
Don't tell me it's Captain
John's treasure mark!

91
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,720
That's right!

92
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,470
This is amazing! How did you get it?

93
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,440
Straw Hat had it!

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,980
The wind doesn't blow east or west!

95
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,290
It looks like it's blowing right towards me!

96
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,440
Speaking of Straw Hat, he made trouble again.

97
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,420
You didn't know? He made
a raid on the Navy HQ!

98
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,550
Are you kidding me?

99
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,750
It's a miracle he's alive, let
alone doing this sort of thing!

100
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,460
Huh? Let's see...

101
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,070
"'First Son of the Sea' Jimbei and
Dark King Silvers Rayleigh..."

102
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,230
Rayleigh?

103
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,890
What?! Wh-What does Rayleigh-san
have to do with Straw Hat?!

104
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,610
Wh... wh... wh... wh... wh...
wh... wh... wh... wh... wh...

105
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,780
...what's going on? I can't
grasp this situation at all.

106
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,650
Wait a minute.

107
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,490
If I remember right, his father
is the Revolutionary - Dragon.

108
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,800
And his grandfather is
Garp. And if that's so...

109
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,130
Rayleigh-san could be his uncle!

110
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,300
Hey Buggy!

111
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,590
A Carrier Bat brought a
message from the Government.

112
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,470
Huh?! How do they know that I'm here?!

113
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,560
D-Don't tell me that the Navy
sent someone to get me here!

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,940
And the message is "Be ready for it"?

115
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,940
Hey, give it to me!

116
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,110
This is...!

117
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,070
--I can't believe this!
--Don't read it before me!

118
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,540
Meanwhile, at the place of Thousand Sunny -

119
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,080
Sabaody Archipelago, Grove
#44 in the Grand Line...

120
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,550
You fools, give us that ship!

121
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,760
That's Straw Hat Luffy's ship, isn't it?

122
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,510
He's the Revolutionary Dragon's son!

123
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,720
We can sell it to the Navy for a good price!

124
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,350
Since we're in the same business,

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,940
we can share the profit
if you just give it to us!

126
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,110
How's that, Flying Fish Riders?!

127
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,040
What? I'm handsome?

128
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,500
I didn't say that! Give us the ship, fool!

129
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,750
I won't give it to you!

130
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,720
Y-You bastard!

131
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,690
Listen, you all. I, good-looking Duval...

132
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,570
...won't let you fools become popular...

133
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,020
I mean, take our ally's ship!
I won't make that popular...

134
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,820
I mean, mistake!

135
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,200
You screwed up your whole speech!

136
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,790
As long as I live, I won't let you
touch the Young Master's ship.

137
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,000
I'd rather touch a girl...
Oh, I made mistake!

138
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,130
I mean, you can't touch it! Right, guys?

139
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,090
Yes, Rose-Some!

140
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,220
Let's go!

141
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,970
Duval-chin, you're so cool!

142
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,310
Because I'm so handsome,
girls won't leave me alone!

143
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,100
I-I love you, too!

144
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,190
Mermaid Cafe should be the
first! It's very sophisticated!

145
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,050
No, the most popular place
on the Fish-Man Island

146
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,700
is the Fish-Man Karate training hall, Camie!

147
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,620
I promised Bones that I'd introduce
him to the Mermaid Princess!

148
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,400
Duval-sama! She's not aware of you!

149
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,760
Oh yeah! Don't mind me!

150
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,420
Shakky-chin, we can get together
again using the Vivre Card, right?

151
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,400
Now we learned that Luffy-chin's
alive from today's newspaper!

152
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,390
I think so. It will take a little time but...

153
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,310
...Ray-san met Monkey-chan
using it without any problem.

154
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,400
We have to protect this ship until then.

155
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,690
We're here to do that, sis!

156
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,200
Whether it's the Navy or somebody else,

157
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,030
we won't let anyone take the ship!

158
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,370
I'm counting on you!

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,670
Duval-sama, we have a
crisis! Here comes Kuma!

160
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,300
Kuma?! There aren't any
bears on this island...

161
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,630
That's...!

162
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,310
It's the Warlord - Bartholomew Kuma!

163
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,370
Don't panic! He came to see Ray-san before.

164
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,030
You're on our side, aren't you?

165
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:46,160
Meanwhile, at Sandy Island - Alabasta
Kingdom in the Grand Line...

166
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,100
The capital - Alubarna...

167
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,400
What happened to the pirates?

168
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,780
We chased them away. The
city is virtually undamaged.

169
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,900
I see. Good job.

170
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,370
We're tightening our
security across the country

171
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,620
but pirates have become more active around
the world since Whitebeard's death.

172
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,290
We have to be careful for the time being.

173
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,040
I wish all pirates were like
Luffy-kun and his crew but...

174
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,260
...they're not.

175
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,050
Speaking of which, King, have
you read today's newspaper?

176
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,100
Yes, of course.

177
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,430
Vivi-sama was happy about
Luffy-kun and the others.

178
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,810
I bet she is.

179
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,190
But...

180
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,270
A FEW HOURS AGO

181
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,640
Karoo!

182
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,280
Look at this, Karoo!

183
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,200
Luffy-san is alive as I thought!

184
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,180
I'm glad! I'm so glad!

185
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,960
Huh? What is this?

186
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,950
In just a moment, she became very serious.

187
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,130
And as soon as she made that face,

188
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,480
she took the newspaper to her room.

189
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,560
What's on Luffy-san's arm?
Numbers? Marks?

190
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,960
Or is it some new fashion?

191
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,080
I don't think so. Luffy-san wouldn't do that.

192
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:32,040
Meanwhile, at some city in some
country in the Grand Line...

193
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,580
H-Hey, why is he here on this island?

194
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,750
Shh! He can hear you!

195
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,920
It's only been 3 weeks since the war.

196
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,840
They just barely escaped death...

197
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,520
...and what are they doing now?

198
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,840
They've got to be up to something.
If not, they're just crazy.

199
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,020
You think so, Daz?

200
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,050
Straw Hat is wounded and wounds
won't heal that easily,

201
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,160
don't you think so?

202
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,160
You smart ass! Are you being sarcastic to me?

203
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,790
I'm healed.

204
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,550
In fact, I'm gonna head back
to the sweet old New World.

205
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,430
You coming?

206
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,100
Of course.

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,080
The news about Luffy's recent exploits...

208
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,880
...has reached each crewmember's hometown...

209
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,060
Look at this, Ace!

210
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,400
You saved your brother's
life - Luffy is alive!

211
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,110
Rest in peace!

212
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,320
Meanwhile, in the Grand Line...

213
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,540
Sorry girls, for the long trip.

214
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,130
Don't worry, we're used to travel.

215
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,050
What are you doing?

216
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,630
We have to make sure that you're resting.

217
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,930
It's Snake Princess-sama's order.

218
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,220
Snake Princess-sama collapsed from too
much heart-fluttering a while ago.

219
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,550
That's why we have to keep an eye on you.

220
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,830
I hope that they'll get it.

221
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,280
They'll get it if they see the article.

222
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,620
The key is your actions and how
uncharacteristic they are of you.

223
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,660
Hey, stop!

224
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,480
There is one guy who looks a bit dull.

225
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,620
But I'm sure he'll manage
to understand it, too.

226
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,750
They will understand you
very well. I have a feeling.

227
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,340
Up in the air above the Grand Line...

228
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,430
Oh yeah! I got it, Luffy!

229
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,440
I got it now! Okay! Okay!

230
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,860
On the giant bridge in the East Blue...

231
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,530
I see. That's what it is.

232
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,000
Huh? What's the matter, Robin-san?

233
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,160
Roger that, Luffy.

234
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,090
Kamabakka Kingdom...

235
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,270
I see, Luffy!

236
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,640
What's going on?

237
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,610
Bowin Islands...

238
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,400
I...

239
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,320
...have to...

240
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,700
...get off of this island!

241
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,360
Bowin! Bowin!

242
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,580
Bowin Islands!

243
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,760
No matter what you have to say to me,

244
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,850
I gotta go see Luffy!

245
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,670
How's that? Have I finally
reached the edge of this island?

246
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,400
You only traveled 20 meters'n.

247
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
No!

248
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,030
Damn! What's wrong with my body?!

249
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,490
Oh, I'm hungry!

250
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,240
Don't, Usopp'n!

251
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,040
You're falling into
the island's trap by eating madly'n!

252
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,790
Shut up! Leave me alone!

253
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,970
I got it!

254
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,870
What is it this time, Usopp'n?

255
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,410
I got it, Luffy!

256
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,060
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

257
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,890
The Sky Island - Weatheria...

258
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,680
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, young girl.

259
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,320
Shh! That's too much!

260
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,190
But they closed the Balloon Terminal

261
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,660
so we have nowhere to run since
this Sky Island is so small.

262
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,750
But I have to run! Think of something!

263
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,960
It's not that easy... Can we
go back to my place for now?

264
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
What?

265
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,860
Hey, hey, can't we go in?

266
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,520
I see.

267
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,130
Honestly! He's not thinking
about how we feel - how selfish!

268
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,780
Young girl! They're coming!

269
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,120
Future Land Baldimore...

270
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,550
Grandpa, what do you think
happened to the old man?

271
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,000
Listen, Kitton, forget about everything.

272
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,010
About that man and about the incident.

273
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,220
That was a big explosion.
There's no way that he's alive.

274
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,520
I told him not to push the
self-destruct button repeated...

275
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,850
...ly...!

276
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,150
What?!

277
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,320
1, 2, 3!

278
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,990
Oh, boy!

279
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,660
Old man!

280
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,930
I see!

281
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,270
Tehna Gehna Kingdom...

282
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,950
There is no time to relax for
me in a place like this...

283
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,450
--Hey!
--Yes.

284
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,700
Finished eating? I'll take the plates.

285
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,140
Go ahead. And I thought I
asked for the newspaper...

286
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,710
Maybe there is a follow-up
story about my friend.

287
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,300
Honestly! You don't even have eyes.
How can you read a newspaper?

288
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,840
I-It irks me to hear someone mention that.

289
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,240
You're up soon! Give it everything you got.

290
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,140
Here you go.

291
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,980
Luffy-san!

292
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,520
Thank you for waiting!

293
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,400
Behold! The Supernatural Moving Skeleton!

294
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,700
Oh, is that what it's all about?

295
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,850
I understand, Luffy-san!

296
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,170
The ruins of Muggy Kingdom...

297
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,380
Hey, wake up! How long are
you gonna stay asleep?

298
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,090
Seriously! How many times
do you wanna get beaten?

299
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,030
I'm taking care of you - see it from my side!

300
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,070
Mind your own business!

301
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:20,280
Oh yeah? I brought you today's
newspaper that I got from News Coo!

302
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,070
There is an update on your captain!

303
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,530
What did you say?!

304
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,420
H-Hey, you! What did you just say?!

305
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,300
R-R-Relax! You better relax!

306
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,500
Hey, are you done yet? My hands hurt.

307
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,460
Give me a minute! There should be a catch...

308
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,860
Luffy doesn't do these kinds of things.

309
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,320
He's with Rayleigh - it
must be Rayleigh's idea.

310
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,100
I know there is a catch.

311
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,120
I don't care - just hurry up!

312
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,300
Just as Luffy's friends are
receiving his messages,

313
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,050
the pirates, who have made
their way to the New World,

314
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,160
begin to fight over who will take
Whitebeard's place as one of the Four Emperors.

315
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,270
As the battle intensifies, a Navy admiral
arrives to put down the pirates!

316
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

317
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,650
"Pirates Get on the Move!
Astounding New World!"

318
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,210
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
