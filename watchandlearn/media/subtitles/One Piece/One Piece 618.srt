2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,000
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,940
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,690
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

11
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,030
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

12
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,330
They landed on Punk Hazard;

13
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,980
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen

14
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,160
and learned about the ruler of the
island - Caesar Clown's motive.

15
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,540
All while trying to escape Shinokuni,

16
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,540
they are heading to R Building with
the children that they rescued.

17
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,540
Finally, a climactic battle rages
on-- between Luffy and Caesar!

18
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,260
LAND OF DEATH

19
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,560
This is my scientific power!

20
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,810
Caesar is...

21
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,400
...the type of person that
Luffy hates the most!

22
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,280
H-Help me, Master!

23
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,410
Luffy won't forgive Caesar!

24
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,750
Caesar!

25
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,710
I don't ever wanna see your face again!

26
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,640
Go to hell!

27
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,130
Gum-Gum...

28
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,970
...Grizzly Magnum!

29
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,730
Oh yeah, Straw Hat!

30
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,610
You can work under me if you want...

31
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,000
"Raid! An Assassin from Dressrosa!"

32
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,050
VARIOUS PLACES IN THE NEW WORLD

33
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,140
What is going on?

34
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,710
Is this some kind of joke?!

35
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,600
This is what they call a "public experiment"?

36
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,190
He kicked Caesar's ass!

37
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,160
Mama should know about this-bon!

38
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,110
Joker is going to take action.

39
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,490
Let "Jack" know about this.

40
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,200
You sure?! It's not gonna be pretty!

41
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,250
I think they formed an alliance.

42
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,870
Let the world know.

43
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,660
This is not just a problem
in the underground anymore.

44
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,790
Watch out! This place is gonna collapse!

45
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,050
B BUILDING 2ND FLOOR

46
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,610
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

47
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,850
Mocha! You can make it!

48
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
Mocha! You're gonna be alright!

49
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,700
Show some medical team guts, guys!

50
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,980
Hey, Chopper-yan! Are you
sure this is the right way?!

51
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,160
I think so!

52
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,400
We gotta join the rest of our
crew as soon as possible!

53
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,610
Chopper, can you hear me?

54
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,080
Is that Usopp?!

55
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,390
Keep going straight and
go down the stairs.--

56
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,130
That's the fastest way to R Building!

57
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,130
R BUILDING 2ND FLOOR - THE SECRET ROOM

58
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,810
I'm gonna shut the door to R building

59
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,130
before the gas flows in!

60
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,690
So hurry up!

61
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,690
A-Alright, thanks!

62
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,550
Everybody, hurry up!

63
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,810
Okay!

64
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,650
Hurry up, Chopper!

65
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,650
Everybody, you're almost there! Keep running!

66
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,950
Nami, you're almost at R Building!

67
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,460
Why is this happening to us?

68
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,590
You guys are just a bunch of guinea pigs!

69
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,130
No one would care if
hundreds of you die or not!

70
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,090
You are the dregs of society!

71
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,440
I can't believe the Master
was such an awful person.

72
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,890
Who should we trust from now?!

73
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,460
This room is not gonna
last very long, either!

74
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,770
Hurry up, everybody!

75
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,770
I found the stairs!

76
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,300
We're almost there!

77
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,200
A little more to go, Mocha! Stay with me!

78
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,730
Chopper-san!

79
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,500
What? Brook?!

80
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,430
This is serious! Kin'emon-san got...

81
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,040
Kin'emon-san got harmed by the gas and...

82
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,250
...died!

83
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,420
What?!

84
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,900
What happened, Brook?!

85
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,560
While we were helping the children
in the examination room evacuate

86
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,440
and looking for Kin'emon-san's
son, we met a girl.

87
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,110
And she said...

88
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,110
What?! Momonosuke turned to a small dragon?!

89
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,200
Uh-huh! I shouldn't tell
anybody but it's true.

90
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Could it be...

91
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,670
Corpse-dono! Maybe, the dragon
I sliced up earlier was...

92
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,130
Momonosuke!

93
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,510
I've done a terrible thing!

94
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,510
Kin'emon-san, you can't go back!

95
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,210
That area is filled up with the gas by now...

96
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,150
The deadly gas is right in front of us!

97
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,330
My spirit will carry me through anything!

98
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,230
Whether it's fire or gas!

99
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,900
Momonosuke!

100
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,320
No, that's impossible! Kin'emon-san!

101
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,660
And he ended up like this.

102
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,490
That's crazy!

103
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,730
What should I do?! What should I do?!

104
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,820
What should I do?! What should I do?!

105
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,330
Chopper! Brook!

106
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,160
What are you doing?! Don't stop!

107
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,300
Just go down the stairs right
there and get into R Building!

108
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,260
The gas is really closing in!

109
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,500
We're almost at R Building! You can make it!

110
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,900
We're almost there! Keep running!

111
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,740
R BUILDING 1ST FLOOR

112
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,450
Luffy!

113
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,370
Oh, Nami!

114
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,790
Great! You're here already!

115
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,190
Oh, Brownbeard-cchi's on the ground!

116
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,420
Is he okay?!

117
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,130
Yeah, he's okay.

118
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,090
Oh, I mean, he's not okay.

119
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,660
The children!

120
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,270
See, Momo? I told you!

121
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,250
Don't worry about the children.

122
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,980
My friends are on their way to help them.

123
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,060
Really?!

124
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,600
They always keep their word!

125
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,190
So don't worry!

126
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,410
Hurry up! Get to where
Nami-san and the others are!

127
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,210
--This way!
--Hurry up!

128
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:25,830
This way!

129
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,830
I see R Building!

130
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,330
Chopper and the others are not there yet?

131
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,870
He was giving the girl first aid.

132
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,880
Can he make it?

133
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,880
This is no good.

134
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,970
I made it!

135
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,580
Are you guys okay?! Good to see you!

136
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,920
He's not here.

137
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,190
Smoker-san...

138
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,820
THE PATH BETWEEN BUILDING R AND D

139
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,950
Do we really need this?

140
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,290
Yes, this is the truck that they
use to transport containers of SAD.

141
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,050
I'm gonna let everybody ride it.

142
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,940
This laboratory will collapse soon.

143
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,130
We have to escape as soon as possible.

144
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,970
Straw Hat-ya!

145
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,220
Tra-guy! Smokey! I didn't expect
you to come from that way!

146
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,020
Trafalgar Law!

147
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,670
Oh, Smo-yan!

148
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,820
What?! Smo-yan?!

149
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,320
--It's Smo-yan!
--Smo-yan!

150
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,490
It's really him!

151
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,240
Smoker-san!

152
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,410
I'm glad that you're okay!

153
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,270
Smo-yan! I'm so glad! We
have so much to report!

154
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,370
Stop screaming!

155
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,880
I know.

156
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,940
Hey! Where did Caesar go?!

157
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,140
Oh, I kicked his ass and he got blown
away along with the door that way!

158
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,890
How far did he go?

159
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,100
Hey! You... Our plan was to kidnap him!

160
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,900
But I don't even wanna
catch that bastard anymore!

161
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,030
That was the plan if you like it or not!
What are you gonna do if he runs away?!

162
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,270
Who cares about that jerk?!

163
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,170
You think you can just
change a plan as you like.

164
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,220
I shouldn't have trusted you!

165
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,250
Let's get him!

166
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,120
What?!

167
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,540
The Straw Hats have foiled the plans

168
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,980
of Master Caesar Clown, scientist
and ruler of Punk Hazard Island.

169
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,560
However, A Building has filled up
with Shinokuni, the deadly gas.

170
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,280
And now, B Building is almost filled as well.

171
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,170
On top of that, Caesar's laboratory
has started collapsing.

172
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,920
Hurry up! Brook! Chopper!

173
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,550
Run! Run!

174
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,010
The only exit to escape from
the laboratory as well

175
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,350
as the island is the "R-66"
door in R Building.

176
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,560
Hang on, Brownbeard-cchi,
for a little bit more.

177
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,310
Chopper will take care of you soon!

178
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,190
Hey, Luffy.

179
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,070
Do you think they are alright?

180
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,660
Of course.

181
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,340
I'm sure they will get here!

182
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,550
Meanwhile, before the showdown
between Luffy and Caesar...

183
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,850
In the sky near Punk Hazard...

184
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,950
The end of mission is the end of love.

185
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,620
DON QUIXOTE PIRATES - A
SERVANT / AN ASSASSIN BABY 5

186
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,620
I'll finish him off when I get back!

187
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,830
Joker! What an asshole!

188
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,210
He killed my sweet fiancé
by destroying the whole town!

189
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,580
I won't forgive him!

190
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,330
And this is the eighth time!

191
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,840
He killed eight men that I loved
and made a commitment to,

192
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,080
and destroyed eight towns!

193
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,740
Why does he want to screw up my happiness?!

194
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,100
Because the Young Master loves you-dasuyan!

195
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,650
DON QUIXOTE PIRATES - A COMBATANT BUFFALO

196
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,290
He loves you like his own sister

197
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,810
so he doesn't begrudge destroying a town

198
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,650
or two-dasuyan!

199
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,320
You have to learn to say "No"!

200
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,440
What was wrong with him?! He needed me!

201
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,620
I fell in love with you at first sight!

202
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,210
Will you marry me?

203
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,540
What?!

204
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,560
Just ten days later, he
became the eighth victim.

205
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,190
I feel terrible!

206
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,560
He shouldn't have loved
me in the first place!

207
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,060
When someone asks you something,
you can't say "No."

208
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,820
You have to do something about it!

209
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,900
It's weird to subscribe to
50 different newspapers!

210
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,100
You lend others too much money!

211
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,540
You are forced to buy so much stuff!

212
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,580
How much debt do you have now?

213
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,940
It's none of your business!
About 98 million berries!

214
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,290
It's my life!

215
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,920
Stay out of it!

216
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,920
Oh yeah! Can I borrow 2 million berries?

217
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,980
What?!

218
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,300
He needs me!

219
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,890
Um... When do you need it?

220
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,900
When I go back, I wanna hit a casino!

221
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,750
Th-Then, I'll get it ready for you
as soon as we complete our mission!

222
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,290
I'll carry out this mission because he
asked me but I'll kill Joker at any cost!

223
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,550
There it is!

224
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,480
Punk Hazard-dasuyan!

225
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,340
The island is covered in Caesar's
gas and I can't see a thing.

226
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,110
Will it go away if I fire this?

227
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,450
No, it won't!

228
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,000
Let me take care of it!

229
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,080
Could you hop off and wait for me, Baby 5?

230
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,960
Okay!

231
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,390
Behold! My typhoon-like power!

232
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,070
Gust - Matasaburo!

233
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,470
Now let's wait there until Caesar,
Monet, and Vergo come out.

234
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,190
I wanna get back quick to play
roulette at a casino-dasuyan!

235
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,270
What's this noise?

236
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,070
It's from there!

237
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,190
What?!

238
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,050
The tanker exploded?!

239
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,180
No! Something hit it-dasuyan!

240
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,430
It's a human! There!

241
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,560
What?! Caesar Clown?!

242
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
No way!

243
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,870
DRESSROSA

244
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,160
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

245
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,870
Ring, ring... Clank!

246
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,200
Joker! This is Buffalo from Punk Hazard!

247
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,620
What's up?

248
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,160
Joker! We just arrived
at Punk Hazard-dasuyan!

249
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,770
We don't know what's going on
but we just saw Master Caesar...

250
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,670
...getting blown out of the
building, injured-dasuyan!--

251
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,100
What?!

252
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,140
Recover Caesar immediately
and come back to Dressrosa!

253
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,520
Okay! We'll recover Caesar-dasuyan!

254
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,360
What about Monet and Vergo?!

255
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,660
There must be a reason. Let's do as he says.

256
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,880
Roger! Joker!

257
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,040
Clank!

258
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,860
Fools.

259
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,150
Hey, squirts! Luck is on my side!

260
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,900
As long as I have Caesar in my
custody, he can create SAD for me!

261
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey, you all! We got to go! Get on the truck!

262
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,480
I wonder what happened to him-dasuyan.

263
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,120
Huh?! Do you see someone
on the deck of the tanker?!

264
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,830
No, I think no one could survive that gas.

265
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,250
What's that?!

266
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,060
A robot?!

267
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,570
What is that strange bird?

268
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,500
In Building R, which is on
the verge of collapse...

269
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,130
...Luffy waits intently for his
crewmates to wrap things up.

270
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,960
Meanwhile,

271
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,140
with the help of some powerful Devil Fruit powers...

272
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,240
...Baby 5 and Buffalo attack.

273
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,440
General Franky alone confronts them.

274
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

275
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,650
Running Wild!
Invincible General Franky!

276
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,750
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
