00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,860
Daybreak hasn’t come yet and I can’t wait

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210
If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830
It’s important not to wake up

We won’t left anyone behind

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,600
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,150
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

79
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,190
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago.

80
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,820
And in order to go on to the
next stage - the New World,

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,490
they set sail for the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level!

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,790
You guys!

83
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,750
Set sail!!

84
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,380
I give you an option.

85
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,760
Do you wanna enlist under our
banner - the New Fish-Man Pirates?

86
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,100
Or do you refuse?

87
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,220
If you refuse, we'll sink you.

88
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,390
No way! Stupid!

89
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,940
Here we go! Coup de Burst!

90
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,530
The bubble here is a double structure!

91
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,740
We're gonna run into one
more bubble! Hold on tight!

92
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,280
Water?!

93
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,870
The current is strong!

94
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,340
Help... me...

95
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,630
Can't breathe...

96
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,930
We have 4 Devil Fruit eaters but...

97
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,730
Reach...

98
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,900
...out!

99
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,530
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

100
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,450
Damn! I can't swim against the current!

101
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,960
Where am I?

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,750
Oh, Luffy-chin!

103
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,670
I'm glad that you're okay!

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,380
This is a coral apartment in the sea.

105
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,640
The dorm is at the very
bottom so the rent is cheap.

106
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,020
We're here, on the surface!

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,230
Hey, Camie!

108
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,020
Everybody!

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,240
I found it!

110
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,490
This is my All Blue!

111
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,540
I see.

112
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,830
Straw Hat Luffy finally got this far.

113
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,340
What should we do, Boss?

114
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,470
Bring him...

115
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,840
...here!

116
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:17,890
"Excitement Blow-out!
Sanji's Life Under Threat!"

117
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,130
Even if the Straw Hats survived, they're humans,

118
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,180
they can't live in the water.

119
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,160
Then they must be somewhere above the water?

120
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,450
Let's just find them!

121
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,430
Now, what should I do?

122
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,560
It's hard to believe that
this place is in the deep sea.

123
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,340
Super!

124
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,510
Hey, Nami! I'm glad that you're okay!

125
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,640
I just thought I was gonna die because of you!

126
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,060
Robin!

127
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,980
Robin.

128
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,980
Robin!

129
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,600
Nami?

130
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,900
Are you alright?

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,610
Where are we? The Fish-Man Island?

132
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,530
Yeah, probably. Franky is scouting it out now.

133
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,700
Oh, you're up, Robin!

134
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,290
--Thanks to you.
--Did you see Luffy and the others?

135
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,710
No, I can't find them.

136
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,000
We just got together again...

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,920
But there's no need to worry!
They wouldn't die so easily.

138
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,220
He's right.

139
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,220
We have to find the Sunny too

140
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,600
but first, should we check
with some inhabitants?

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,640
I found a town nearby.

142
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,480
Sanji-chan!

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm on my way!

144
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,240
I'll...

145
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,240
...live...

146
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,450
...here!

147
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,620
Sanji-chan, you're so funny!

148
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,960
He seems to have recovered after all.
By his willpower alone?

149
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,010
I wanna swim like you guys.

150
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,800
Luffy-chin, you can swim with a bubble on.

151
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,550
Really?

152
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,220
Yeah, any craftsman in the city
can make one for you right away.

153
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,580
I'm glad because if he has a nosebleed now,

154
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,440
we don't have blood for a transfusion.

155
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,310
And Sanji's blood type is very rare.

156
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,020
Huh? That's not good, is it?

157
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,530
Hey, Camie.

158
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,820
There is somebody that I really
wanna see on the Fish-Man Island.

159
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,870
Who is it? The Mermaid Princess?

160
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,370
Nope.

161
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,200
It's Jimbei!

162
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,210
Boss Jimbei?

163
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,040
Hey Luffy, you mean Jimbei the Warlord?!

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,760
No, he resigned during the war so he's the former Warlord.

165
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,970
Yeah, he's my friend!

166
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,350
What's up with you?
You know the pirate empress, too.

167
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,850
When Ace died 2 years ago, I didn't lose heart...

168
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,110
...thanks to him!

169
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,520
You brat!

170
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,450
Can't you see things clearly now?!

171
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,200
You can't get back what you've lost!

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,660
What is it that you still have?!

173
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,840
I still have my friends!

174
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,930
I wanna see Jimbei!

175
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,430
See you at the Fish-Man Island in 2 years!

176
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,940
I'm looking forward to the day
when you and your friends visit us!

177
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,120
We made a promise to meet
again on this island.

178
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,740
Oh yeah, I read in the newspaper
that you were with Jimbei.

179
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,410
Yoo-hoo!

180
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,290
Where's Jimbei?

181
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,830
Um, Boss is not on the island now.

182
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,750
Huh?

183
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,010
He resigned from the Warlords
during the war 2 years ago.

184
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,550
So the former members of the Fish-Man
Pirates could no longer stay here

185
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,970
and they left with Boss Jimbei.

186
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,350
What?! So I can't see him here?

187
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,860
It's a long story. But the war had a
lot of effects on this island too...

188
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,530
--Camie!
--Camie!

189
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,860
--Camie!
--Camie!

190
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,530
Camie!

191
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,950
--A ship is coming!
--It might be!

192
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,660
--The royal family's ship!
--Maybe no one's on it!

193
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,200
I'm sure somebody is!

194
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,080
Who's on it, Medaka-chin sisters?

195
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
We don't know yet.

196
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,170
--You don't often see the royal family's ship.
--They seldom come here.

197
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,170
Maybe they're coming to catch Luffy-chin
and the others for illegal entry!

198
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,010
So what?

199
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,970
What?

200
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,130
You guys need to hide!

201
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,100
Sanji-chan, this way!

202
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Okay!

203
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,350
RYUGU PALACE

204
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,520
Is it the royal family's gondola?

205
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,570
You think so?

206
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,650
--It is!
--Maybe!

207
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,940
--I bet so!
--So what?

208
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,900
But it can't be somebody
from the royal family!

209
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,030
They don't bother coming all the
way to this corner of the island.

210
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,220
The Neptune 3 brothers-sama are here!

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,600
Hello, girls of the cove.

212
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,140
RYUGU KINGDOM THE NEPTUNE 3 BROTHERS

213
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,140
I want to ask something.

214
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,100
--Princes!
--What brought you here?

215
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,230
Princes?

216
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,650
No, Sanji-chan!

217
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,570
Hide here and stay still.

218
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,240
What is this? Marshmallow?

219
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,960
Ah, no, it's not.

220
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,770
The milky sweet smell.

221
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,990
Don't know why but it makes me feel comfortable.

222
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,460
Is it a fruit from the
Fish-Man Island? Sniff, sniff.

223
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,920
Hey, what is...

224
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,690
I received a report of an illegal entry.

225
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,480
FIRST SON - FUKABOSHI (SHARK MERMAN)

226
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,360
Didn't they come here?

227
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,440
If you've seen them, tell me-fa-so-la-ti-do!

228
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,240
SECOND SON - RYUBOSHI (OARFISH MERMAN)

229
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,570
If you haven't seen them, that's fine-mi-re-do!

230
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,570
Moonfish! Shake, shake!

231
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,280
THIRD SON - MANBOSHI (MOONFISH MERMAN)

232
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,280
I wanna stay here and play!

233
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,700
We haven't seen anybody.

234
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,750
Are they that important?

235
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,630
That you princes have
to come all the way here?

236
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,510
Well, I'm not sure if they're
who I think they are yet.

237
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,970
He's not sure-mi-re-do!

238
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,640
I can't hold it any longer!

239
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,850
Everybody, let's dance together!

240
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,860
What's going on?

241
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,360
Hey, look! They're the
princes of Neptune's army!

242
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,780
Why're they here?

243
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,910
What a pain in the ass. What should we do?

244
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,030
Let's see how things go.

245
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,210
Hmmm. Okay. Thank you very much.

246
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,620
We'll check somewhere else.

247
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,380
Sorry to bother you when you're having fun.

248
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,210
Let's dance another time!

249
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,720
Sorry for the bother-so-fa-mi-re-do!

250
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,430
Anytime!

251
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,180
Maybe the border guards
were just seeing things.

252
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,930
They're leaving.

253
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,020
Sniff, sniff!

254
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,570
Sniff, sniff!

255
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,240
Sniff, sniff!

256
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,110
Sniff!

257
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,490
--Sanji!
--What is that?!

258
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,670
Sanji-chan!

259
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,460
That was too much blood! He's in danger!

260
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,340
He couldn't hold it! All that
pent-up excitement exploded!

261
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,220
Sanji!

262
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,640
That's...

263
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,140
No mistaking him.

264
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,510
The pirate - Straw Hat Luffy!

265
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,270
--Ammo Knights!
--Yes, sir!

266
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,300
Damn!

267
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,980
They look all the same!

268
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,680
Doesn't feel like I've advanced even a little!

269
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,950
Are you the Pirate Hunter
Zoro from the Straw Hats?

270
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,660
Yeah, so what?

271
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,130
There they are! Straw Hat and the others.

272
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,710
What should we do? They'll catch them first.

273
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,050
But we don't wanna cause any
trouble with Neptune's army.

274
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,890
Wait a minute!

275
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,230
We're sorry about the illegal entry!
But you can't arrest us now!

276
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,520
Can somebody donate blood now?!

277
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,980
If nothing is done,
our friend is gonna die within an hour!

278
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,690
His blood type is S RH negative.

279
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,480
It's rare but does anybody here share the same blood type?

280
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,740
Or are Fish-Men and Mermaids'
blood totally different?

281
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,950
Chopper-chin.

282
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,750
We don't have time! Anyone?!

283
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,460
This is... This is the dumbest way to die!

284
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,000
Somebody please! I beg you!

285
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,470
Give blood to Sanji!

286
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,090
Luffy-chin, Chopper-chin!

287
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,650
Mermaids and Fish-Men blood

288
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,720
are the same as humans so we can donate blood!

289
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,890
But...

290
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,230
Those humans are talking nonsense!

291
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,990
Those guys with sea monsters!

292
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,280
Prince Fukaboshi, that's Hammond
from the Fish-Man District.

293
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,350
There is nobody on this island who would

294
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,840
give blood to such lowly creatures as humans.

295
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,060
If somebody does,

296
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,970
he risks the Punishment of the Dark Night from human haters.

297
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,470
Punishment?

298
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,930
He can just keep losing
blood helplessly and die!

299
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,100
There is this old law in our kingdom.

300
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,650
Donating blood to humans is prohibited.

301
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,150
What?!

302
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,700
Make no mistake!
You humans set the rule first!

303
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,290
You people have a long history
of fearing us as monsters

304
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,910
and refused to get your blood mixed-up!

305
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,170
That's why Fisher Tiger,
the hero of the Fish-Man Island, died.

306
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,510
Fisher... Tiger?

307
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,720
He risked his own life to
free slaves of all races

308
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,640
but after a bloody war,

309
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,270
he lost his life although he could've
survived if he had a transfusion!

310
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,560
Those heartless humans
refused to give blood so he died!

311
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,650
Straw Hat, here is what I want you to do.

312
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,420
Just give up on your crewmember's life

313
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,610
and come to the Fish-Man District with us!

314
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,120
The captain of the New Fish-Man Pirates

315
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,420
- Hordy Jones is expecting you guys.

316
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,460
Shut up!

317
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,630
Hey, I don't know about the law but please!

318
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,050
Isn't there anyone with S RH negative?!

319
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,340
I'll do anything to repay you!

320
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,310
Just as long as you save his life now!

321
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,140
I said "It's no use"!

322
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,020
Camie!

323
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,190
If you don't comply...

324
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,150
Second Gear!

325
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,110
...I'll take you by force!

326
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,280
Trawl Net!

327
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,870
I told you that we weren't gonna join you!

328
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,370
...Jet...

329
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,870
Pistol!

330
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,130
Luffy, a monster behind you!

331
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,140
Hammond and the others got...

332
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,520
The monster gave up without fighting!

333
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,780
Cool!

334
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,110
What was it? Luffy-chan's unbelievable!

335
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,700
Impressive.

336
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,280
Luffy-chin and everybody!

337
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,960
Bring Sanji-chin, too! Let's go to the town!

338
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,460
It's the Ryugu!

339
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,920
There are many humans at the
harbor of the town! Hurry up!

340
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,550
Okay!

341
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,270
Alright, we're ready! Camie, let's go!

342
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,690
Uh-huh! Please, Ryugu-chin,
take us to the town!

343
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,150
Mosu!

344
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,280
Hey you, wait! The Ryugu is Princes'...

345
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,410
I'm sorry! I'll bring it back to
you as soon as we save Sanji-chin!

346
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,620
They're leaving!

347
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,830
We don't have a ride home-fa-mi-re-do!

348
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,210
Hmm.

349
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm sorry. If my blood type
matched, I wouldn't refuse.

350
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,820
You don't have to apologize.

351
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,680
It all started because of his lecherous feelings.

352
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,350
Look. He's still smiling a little.

353
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,060
...And at the same time, it's nice and bouncy...

354
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,150
Sanji, that's enough!
Don't think about anything!

355
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,860
You're in a delicate state!

356
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,910
You and Hachi were discriminated
against at Sabaody 2 years ago

357
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,700
so I guess it really runs deep.

358
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,750
I can't believe Sanji's dirty
mind caused such a big issue!

359
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,260
Yeah, and even if we get to the town,

360
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,460
I don't know if we can find a donor right away.

361
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,540
What?

362
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,670
We haven't had that many
human visitors for a month.

363
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,300
You guys are our first visitors in a while.

364
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,220
Why? I thought this was the famous scoop.

365
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,720
Yes, it is a famous spot.

366
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,720
We don't know why.

367
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,610
They say maybe somebody
is standing in the voyagers' way.

368
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,730
Somebody powerful is up to something
- that's the talk of the Kingdom.

369
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,820
That was no good, ladies.

370
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,660
Why were you hiding the pirates?

371
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,620
I'm sorry, Prince Fukaboshi.

372
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,250
They were Camie's friends.

373
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,670
And they were good people and we
didn't want them to be arrested.

374
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,720
I hope Sanji-chan will be fine.

375
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,140
You ladies mistook us.
He's a well-known pirate,

376
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,640
he didn't need to go through immigration.

377
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,730
Because we know his identity.

378
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,400
We were looking for them for
another reason-re-mi-fa!

379
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,070
Oh, is it so?

380
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,410
And we were unable to deliver
the message from Jimbei, as well.

381
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,170
Sanji's overexcitement has put him in danger.

382
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,930
Luffy and his crew follow Camie to the Mermaid Cafe
in search of a blood donor to save his life.

383
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,430
There, they meet a gifted psychic, Madam Sharley,

384
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:41,770
and she predicts a terrible future for Luffy's crew!

385
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

386
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,840
"The Fish-Man Island Will Be Annihilated?!
Sharley's Prophecy!"

387
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
