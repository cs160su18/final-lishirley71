00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,250
Who are you?

22
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,540
"Blue-nosed Reindeer!
Chopper's Secret"

23
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,020
Isn't that...

24
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,230
backwards?

25
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,160
You're too slow... and you're
not completely hiding, either...

26
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,910
Just what are you?

27
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,910
Sh... Shut up, human!

28
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,090
And, how's your fever?

29
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,040
It talked!!

30
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,860
Be quiet, Chopper!

31
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,360
Your fever seems to have
come down a little, girl.

32
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,570
Are you happy?

33
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,180
Who are you?

34
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,460
38.2 degrees... Hmm...
You're doing more or less all right.

35
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,270
I'm a doctor. Dr. Kureha.

36
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,250
Call me Doctorine.

37
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,560
Doctor...

38
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,250
Then I'm in the...

39
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,290
My secret to staying young?

40
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,300
No, I didn't ask that.

41
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,960
You're right. You're in the
castle on top of the mountain.

42
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,990
Then there were two others
besides me, right?

43
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,060
Yeah, they're sleeping in the next room...

44
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,660
very deeply. What tough guys...

45
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,540
This was the cause.

46
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,490
What... is this?

47
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,780
You were bitten by a bug called Kestia.

48
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,080
It's a poisonous tick that lives in jungles
with high temperature and humidity.

49
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,240
Once you're bitten by it,
bacteria come in and

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,800
keep you in pain by lying dormant
inside your body for 5 days.

51
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,810
It causes high fever of above 40 degrees,

52
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,560
coinfection, myocarditis,
arteritis, cerebritis!

53
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,130
Given the infection's progression
from the bitten area,

54
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,310
I'd say you've been
infected for three days.

55
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,670
The suffering must've
been unusually harsh,

56
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,410
but it would've eased up in 2 more
days even without any treatment.

57
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,270
In 2 more days...?

58
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,230
Yeah, because you
would've died in 2 days.

59
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,390
What?!

60
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,480
It's called the "5-day disease."

61
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,290
I heard that Kestia died
out 100 years ago,

62
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,250
but it was useful that I kept
the antibiotic just in case.

63
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,600
Where did you guys come from?

64
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,720
Were you out walking around
with your belly exposed

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,870
in a jungle on an ancient
island or something?

66
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,630
Well, that's just silly...

67
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,070
Ah...

68
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,740
That ring a bell?

69
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,560
What a crazy girl...

70
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,480
Now...

71
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,690
Stay in bed. Your treatment
hasn't completely finished yet.

72
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,320
Thank you so much.

73
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,260
So long as my fever
comes down, I'll be fine.

74
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,560
My body will take care of
itself after that, right?

75
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,310
You're too optimistic.

76
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,030
This disease normally takes at
least 10 days to fully treat.

77
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,600
Of course, if you want to
suffer some more and die...

78
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,290
Even with my medicine,
you'll have to rest at least 3 days.

79
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,130
What?

80
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,840
I can't stay here for 3 days!

81
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,170
We have to take Vivi to Alabasta soon!

82
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,470
When a patient of mine leaves me,

83
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,980
she's either cured or dead.
I won't let you get away.

84
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,220
He climbed this mountain
with his bare hands?!

85
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,090
This 5000m high Drum Rock?!

86
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,340
His entire body is nearly frostbitten.

87
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,580
What was he thinking dressing like this?

88
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,820
Heat water immediately
and throw him into it.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,330
This guy's bleeding badly.

90
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,890
6 broken ribs and a spinal fissure.

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,780
Can I operate on him?

92
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,610
Apparently, the most
critical one is this girl.

93
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,990
She's dying.

94
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,560
Chopper! Have phenicol,
cardiotonic and tialcillin ready!

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,070
Does she have an infection?

96
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,350
Yeah. The pathogen
isn't from this island.

97
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,130
Hm?

98
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,030
Don't worry. I'll make both that
bleeding kid and this girl all better.

99
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,180
So rest assured.

100
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,270
They're my friends...!

101
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,060
I get the picture. I'll save them.

102
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,280
Chopper! Let's begin treatment!

103
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,500
They're my friends...!

104
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm...

105
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,380
I'm hungry...

106
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,280
Meat...

107
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,360
Venison stew needs to be
cooked in a pot for 3 hours...

108
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,250
Then the meat becomes properly tender...

109
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,360
Meat...

110
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,940
Venison...

111
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,420
Ahhhh! Help!

112
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,420
Wait, meat!

113
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,180
Wait, Luffy! I'll cook this guy!

114
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,660
Hm?

115
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,090
Nami...

116
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,280
Nami-san!

117
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,890
You got better?

118
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,260
Yeah, thanks.

119
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,470
Okay, then! I'll make a nutritious
venison dish for Nami-san!

120
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,410
Wait!

121
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,210
I'm surprised!
They can already move around?

122
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,780
What's that talking stuffed
deer with a blue nose?

123
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,470
You asking me what he is?

124
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,980
Don't run away, meat!

125
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,850
Wait, Luffy! I'm telling you
not to eat it yet!

126
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,120
Stop it, humans!

127
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,850
His name is Chopper.
He's just a reindeer with a blue nose.

128
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,320
Reindeers don't speak.

129
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,930
S-stop it, you jerks!

130
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,780
If he's different from
ordinary reindeers in some way,

131
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,730
If he's different...?

132
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,490
I'm not food!

133
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,840
it's just because he ate a
Human Human Fruit. That's all.

134
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,000
A Human Human Fruit...
One of the devil fruits...

135
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,330
Yeah...

136
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,240
He's a reindeer who
gained the humans' abilities.

137
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,130
Rats! Rats!

138
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,440
And I taught him everything
I know about medicine.

139
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,850
Wapol-sama.
That Straw Hat is up there...

140
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,110
I'm starting to get a bit hungry.

141
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,830
I'll eat the rubber man for a snack.

142
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,040
We're going up.

143
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,890
Dalton-san!

144
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,580
Dalton-san!

145
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,730
Did you find him?!

146
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,940
Dalton-san! Don't die!

147
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,150
We'll find him in time, for sure!

148
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,150
Be alive, Dalton-san!

149
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,770
Who's that?

150
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,740
Don't just stand there! Help...

151
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,340
Gotta bow.

152
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,360
Like I said, don't just
stand there and help us!

153
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,540
What the heck is that thing?!

154
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,040
We found him!

155
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,080
We found Dalton-san!

156
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,000
What?! They found him?!

157
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,220
Great!

158
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,680
Dalton-san!

159
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,840
Dalton-san!

160
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,310
So, who is that?!

161
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,390
This is terrible...

162
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,940
There's no heartbeat.

163
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,900
Become one of my crew!
Please, old lady!

164
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,230
We need a doctor on our ship!

165
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,740
Luffy... You said that's your name, right?

166
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,610
Yeah.

167
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,670
Did you just say "old lady"?

168
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,170
Yeah, I did, old la...

169
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,580
Watch... what you say!

170
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,740
I'm still in the youthful 130s.

171
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,260
Whoa... What an incredible old hag...

172
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,020
Are you asking me to be a pirate?

173
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,770
Don't be ridiculous!

174
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,900
It'll be a waste of my glorious time.

175
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,490
I'm not interested in the sea.

176
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,320
Who cares? Let's go on
an adventure, old lady!

177
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,280
Hey hey. I just told you to
watch what you say, didn't I?

178
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,000
So they're pirates...

179
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,490
Hm?

180
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,330
Hm?

181
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,020
Ah!

182
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,690
--Wait, meat!

183
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,000
--Wait!
--Wait, meat!

184
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,550
Hold it, brats!

185
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,370
Wait!

186
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,240
Hold on, Nami-san!
I'll cook a nutritious reindeer dish!

187
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,570
Before that, I'll eat you guys!

188
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,280
Old hag!

189
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,470
Where the heck did she come from?

190
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,980
She's coming! She's coming!
She's coming! She's coming!

191
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,990
I don't care about the food.
I just want some peace and quiet.

192
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,830
Snow...? Even though
this is inside the castle...?

193
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,520
Cold...!

194
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,410
I should close the door.

195
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,890
Stay in bed!

196
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,570
You still have a fever!

197
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,630
I don't. It seems like
it's pretty much gone.

198
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,990
Looks like I lost them...

199
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,530
Even so, no!

200
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,150
Since Doctorine's medicine works well,
the fever goes away quickly.

201
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,000
But Kestia's bacteria
still remain in your body.

202
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,430
Have the antibiotic shot
and stay in bed, or you'll...

203
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,690
Thank you...

204
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,680
Hm?

205
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,940
You've been attending me, right?

206
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,510
Sh...

207
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,330
Shut up!

208
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,970
I don't wanna be thanked by a human!

209
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,780
Don't mock me! You jerk!

210
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,010
Don't be silly, you dummy!

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,180
Seriously, don't be so...

212
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,680
He's the type that
can't hide their emotions...

213
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
This castle is strange.
It's cold and there's snow inside.

214
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,670
Oh...?

215
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,810
Ahhh! It's cold!

216
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,040
Like I told you before, you're slow!

217
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,820
Look at this...

218
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,680
There's snow everywhere in the castle.

219
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,070
The doors for the unused
rooms are all frozen, too.

220
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,920
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

221
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,110
Hey hey, Luffy! Give up on
asking that old hag to join us!

222
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,050
She's not a doctor!
She's trying to kill us!

223
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,850
Are you guys pirates?

224
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,730
Yes...

225
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,210
R-real ones?

226
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,520
Real ones.

227
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,180
You have a flag with a skull?

228
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,720
It's attached to our ship.

229
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,280
Are you interested in pirates?

230
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,740
No! You idiot! No!

231
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,900
You idiot!

232
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,700
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

233
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,710
But... Then...

234
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,670
wanna come, too?

235
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,330
What?!

236
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,680
To the sea!
Why don't you come with us...?

237
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Hm?

238
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,440
If you do, that'll help me a lot!

239
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,870
If we have a doctor on our ship,

240
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,110
I won't have to stay here
for 3 days, right?

241
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,840
On top of that, on our ship, we...

242
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,390
D... Don't be ridiculous!
I'm a reindeer!

243
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,000
There's no way I can stay with humans!

244
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,230
To start with, don't you
get scared when you see me?

245
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,150
I'm a reindeer, but I stand on
two legs and I even speak...

246
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,440
What? Are you trying to scare me?

247
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,090
My nose is blue, too...

248
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,510
There you are!

249
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,360
Reindeer!

250
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,750
Wait!

251
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,020
Those brats sure are quick.

252
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,300
I don't like it... girl...

253
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,040
What?

254
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,100
Are you tempting the reindeer without
my permission while I'm not here?

255
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,540
Oh? Do I need permission
to make a move on a man?

256
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,870
No, you don't. If you wanna
take him, go right ahead.

257
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,460
But it won't be easy.

258
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,950
He has a scar in his heart...

259
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,820
It's a big scar that
even I can't cure...

260
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,850
The moment he was born into this world,

261
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,870
his group and even his
parents abandoned him...

262
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,770
What?

263
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,040
because he had a blue nose.

264
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,460
He always walked at the very back
of the group all by himself...

265
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,820
even though he was a new-born child...

266
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,100
And one day, he ate a devil fruit

267
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,820
and was treated as
a monster even more.

268
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,310
The reindeers fiercely
pressured him to leave.

269
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,460
He was no longer an
ordinary reindeer in any way.

270
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,740
Still, he wanted friends...

271
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,010
So he went down to a village,
as a human this time.

272
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,900
Hey... what's that creature?

273
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,000
But his figure wasn't
exactly human, either.

274
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,960
For some reason,
his nose stayed blue, too.

275
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,140
It must be a yeti!

276
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,010
It's dangerous!
Get the children inside quickly!

277
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,650
A gun! Bring me a gun!

278
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,720
Shoot him to death!

279
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,050
You damn monster!

280
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,420
Go away!

281
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,780
He didn't know what was wrong.

282
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,100
Nor did he know what to blame...

283
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,970
You damn monster!

284
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,340
He just wanted friends,
yet he was called a monster...

285
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,240
He was no longer a reindeer...

286
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,040
He wasn't a human, either...

287
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,060
He's lived all alone like that...

288
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,000
Can you guys heal the scar in his heart?

289
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,450
Hey, Luffy. Look at that door at
the front entrance. It's wide open.

290
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,050
Hm?

291
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,220
No wonder it's cold.

292
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,160
In any case, let's close this door.

293
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,980
With it open like this, there's no difference
between outside and inside the castle.

294
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,320
Hey! Stop it! Don't touch that door!

295
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,640
Huh?

296
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,880
Never mind what he says.
Let's close it, or we'll freeze to death.

297
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,780
True.

298
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,320
Hey! Didn't I tell you to... stop it?!

299
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,140
What's with him? Why is he angry?

300
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,360
Hey Luffy. Come over here.

301
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,250
Hm?

302
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,600
Look up there.

303
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,950
Hm...?

304
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,430
Ah!

305
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,210
They're baby snowbirds.

306
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,440
Well, if we close the door, they'll fall...

307
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,440
That's why they can't close it...

308
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,150
It's cold!

309
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,760
Hold on a sec...

310
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,090
What is it?

311
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,220
Wasn't he speaking earlier?!

312
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,310
Well, come to think of it, I sort of
remember him standing on two legs.

313
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,470
He's a monster!

314
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,440
Wh... What the heck is that?

315
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,710
He's walking on two legs...

316
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,010
He's a reindeer...

317
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,800
He's fluffy...

318
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,750
He's short...

319
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,300
He becomes big...

320
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,900
And he's a monster!

321
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,880
What a cool guy! He's interesting!

322
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,050
Sanji! Let's have him join us!

323
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,450
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

324
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

325
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

326
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:57,560
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

327
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

328
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,310
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

329
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

330
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,210
Nami! Did you see the reindeer?

331
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,590
Geez, you guys! Cut it out already!

332
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,450
Well, it's not that we're
not trying to eat him.

333
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,190
Chopper has had lots of
hardships in his life.

334
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,990
I see...

335
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,590
But I heard that there was
one person who accepted him.

336
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,150
Really? What kind of person was that?

337
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

338
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,270
"An Outcast's Dream!
Hiriluk the Quack!"

339
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,530
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
