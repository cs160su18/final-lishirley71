00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
--Whoa!!
--Whoa!!

Edited at https://subtitletools.com

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,750
Wealth, fame, power...

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,700
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
attained everything
this world has to offer.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,790
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,560
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,410
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,760
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,450
and set out in search
of something to find

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,450
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,260
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,070
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,990
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

20
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,880
and set out in search
of something to find

22
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,380
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,010
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,400
Only to defeat this man...

26
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,000
Three Swords Style Technique!

27
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,870
Better not regret it when I kill you!

28
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,280
Three Thousand Worlds!

29
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,260
Zoro!!

30
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,740
"The Deadly Foot Technique Bursts Forth!
Sanji vs. the Invincible Pearl"

31
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,340
All right!

32
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,950
They want to fight, too!

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,830
I'm getting fired up!

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,740
Pops! You promised, okay?

35
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,790
Once I drive them away,
I'll quit doing chores. Okay?

36
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,410
Couldn't ask for more.

37
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,760
If you do chores for a year,
this place will get messed up.

38
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,470
All right!

39
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,500
You said you were going to be
King of the Pirates. Are you serious?

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,430
Yeah, of course! I'll definitely
be King of the Pirates!

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,160
I've come across tons of roughnecks.

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,070
But you're the first one in a long
time who said that so clearly.

43
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,320
I heard that you were
an incredibly strong pirate.

44
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,280
Were you going to be
King of the Pirates?

45
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,040
I forgot about the past.

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,370
I'm the owner of a restaurant
now and that's enough for me.

47
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,610
Guys! As long as we take that ship,

48
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,970
the Grand Line is
nothing to be scared of!

49
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,970
We can get closer and make a surprise
attack on enemy ships more effectively

50
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,730
than pretending to be a Navy ship
or raising the white flag of surrender.

51
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,150
We can make a definite sneak attack.

52
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,520
It's true that no one would think...

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,110
that pirates are on board
such a silly-looking ship.

54
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,990
B-But, Don... Even if we enter
the Grand Line again using that ship,

55
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,940
if we come across someone
like Hawk-Eye Mihawk again...

56
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,330
Are you still afraid of
someone like that? Huh?!

57
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,510
N-No...

58
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,510
You think an ordinary human
can slice up a large sailing ship?!

59
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,370
That's probably the
power of a devil fruit.

60
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,630
Although those with devil fruit powers
are considered by society to be legends,

61
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,430
the Grand Line is crawling with them.

62
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,440
Mihawk must've used some strange
power when he sliced up the ship.

63
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Even that straw hat brat is a mere
pirate once he enters the Grand Line.

64
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,300
But Red Foot Zeff
traveled there for a year.

65
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,140
I can't but think that he had ways
of confronting those monsters.

66
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,400
And those methods must
be written in his logbook.

67
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,730
If we're lucky, so is
information on the One Piece.

68
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,630
I see... That's our Don Krieg!

69
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,030
So long as we have
that ship and the logbook,

70
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,700
we'll find a way to the One Piece again!

71
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,160
Got that, guys?! Let's go!
We'll take over the restaurant!

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,660
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

73
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,380
This ship belongs to us... to the cooks!

74
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,880
We can't let them have it...
no matter what happens!

75
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,710
N-Now... what do we do
to operate this again?

76
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,840
Hurry up!

77
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,310
As it stands, the restaurant
will be a battlefield...

78
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,580
I wish there was a restaurant
in the middle of the sea...

79
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,370
I was thinking that if I
could leave this place alive,

80
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,980
I'd build a restaurant as
my final purpose in life...

81
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,810
A restaurant as my
final purpose in life...

82
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,170
Go to the operating room
and open up the fins.

83
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,530
What? Open up the fins?

84
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,890
That's gonna give
a foothold to the enemy!

85
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,960
That's fine. We can't make the inside
of this restaurant a battlefield.

86
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,710
If it becomes a battlefield,
that damn geezer will complain.

87
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,820
Did you say something, you damn brat?

88
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,810
Yeah, I said you like
to complain! Now, go.

89
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,120
O... Okay...

90
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,540
Here they come! They're finally coming!

91
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,040
Here I come! Gum-Gum...

92
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,500
...Rocket!

93
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,790
Ugh! He's flying over here!

94
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,420
And Gum-Gum...

95
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,510
...Giant Scythe!

96
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,020
Hey, that chore boy is pretty good!

97
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,980
--J-Just what the heck...
--...is he...

98
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,820
The Grand Line is crawling
with guys like this?

99
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,720
--Sanji!
--Hmm?

100
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,780
Watch carefully how he fights.

101
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,250
Don't take your eyes off him until
the moment this fight comes to an end.

102
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,100
To think that you attack the
restaurant after they gave you food...

103
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,540
I'll beat up an ungrateful jerk like you!

104
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,050
So you actually want to fight on
the water when there's little foothold?

105
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,020
Those with devil fruit powers are
helpless in the sea. I know that much.

106
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,980
--Anchor boy!
--Instead, I can stretch.

107
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,030
Sanji! The fins are gonna open up now!

108
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,200
--Hmm?
--What's going on?

109
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
From the sea...

110
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,010
...a foothold has appeared!

111
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,280
Whoa! Check that out!!

112
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,990
We'll fight to the utmost,
you damn pirates!

113
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,580
I see. You set up that battlefield so that
the restaurant itself won't be damaged.

114
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,960
That works out for us too,
since that ship's gonna be ours.

115
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,720
I want this ship all the more.

116
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,420
We won't let you have this restaurant!

117
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,120
That's right! Don't make light of us!

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,300
We're fighting cooks!

119
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,110
Take sail! The Baratie's sea
battle weapon, Mackerel Head 1!

120
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,070
If you don't wanna die,
get out of here now!

121
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,230
What the hell is that?

122
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,580
That's so cool! I want it!

123
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,120
--Paddle faster!
--I'm paddling as fast as I can!

124
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,580
Fire!!

125
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,470
I'm gonna sink!

126
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,890
--All right! Good job!
--Patty! Carne! Get them!

127
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,560
They're pretty good!

128
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,770
Don't look away! We're aiming at him!

129
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah!

130
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,280
Krieg! Be prepared!!

131
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,280
Watch how powerful the Sea Restaurant
Baratie's sea battle weapon is!

132
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,250
What? Did we bump into something?

133
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,260
Hmm? We can't move!

134
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,920
I'm Don Krieg!

135
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,260
I'm the man who will
rule the world's oceans!

136
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,220
I told you that's gonna be me!

137
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,850
I don't have time for your games!

138
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,320
What Herculean strength he has!

139
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,160
It's coming this way!

140
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,750
The restaurant will be destroyed!

141
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,890
--Sanji!
--W-With his foot?!

142
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,130
Wh-What strong legs!

143
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,970
He kicked back that weird boat!

144
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,300
That foot technique is...

145
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,260
There goes! Sanji's kick!

146
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,550
He's pretty good!

147
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,530
You son of a bitch, Sanji!

148
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,470
Are you trying to crush your allies?

149
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,150
--Yeah...
--Don't "yeah" us, you crazy stew!

150
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,990
You almost lost powerful assets,
you stupid spaghetti!

151
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,580
Do you really think you have
time to crack jokes, cooks?

152
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,290
Let's get them!

153
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,750
Even with a weapon, a cook's a cook.

154
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,230
We're expert fighters who're in
a whole other league from you.

155
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,560
Now, be good little cooks and go
find a land restaurant to cook for.

156
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,470
Hey, you guys! Why are you letting
those guys beat you up so easily?!

157
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,440
Do you still call
yourselves fighting cooks?!

158
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,940
Well, they're strong!

159
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,410
They're totally different from
those we've fought before!

160
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,240
Don't lump us in with
those average pirates.

161
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,370
We're the Krieg Pirates,
the rulers of the East Blue.

162
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,340
Just decree to them... that the ship
already belongs to the Krieg Pirates!

163
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,670
Don't be mistaken.

164
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,220
We won't let you take even
one step into the restaurant.

165
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,470
He's exactly right!

166
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,670
I've been a cook for
more than ten years.

167
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,900
I visited 300 restaurants.

168
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,190
I got fired for causing a scuffle
all the time and I lived a rough life.

169
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,210
This is the place we finally came to

170
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,700
after going to restaurant
after restaurant...

171
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,430
Anybody there?!

172
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,920
Is this the restaurant
run by Red Foot Zeff?!

173
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,660
This "Damn Cooks Wanted"
better be true!

174
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,170
Yeah, it's true.

175
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,670
Be they arch rogues or jail breakers,

176
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,250
if they badly want to eat and
find their way to this restaurant,

177
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:41,730
we'll feed them until they're stuffed.
Can you handle that?!

178
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,060
Y-Yes, sir!

179
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,990
We can't serve such a nasty
soup to the customers!

180
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,030
What did you hit me for?!

181
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,790
That's a sign for determination!

182
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,250
Shut up!

183
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,030
Scuffles... cooking...
We're allowed to do whatever we like.

184
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,040
There's no other
restaurant as good as this.

185
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,260
So they say. Got that, Krieg?

186
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,760
Committing ourselves to cooking
every day is a fierce battle.

187
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,220
Compared to that, the pirates
we're facing today are nothing!

188
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,680
He's exactly right!

189
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,390
--Fight!
--Yeah!

190
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,850
--Protect Owner!!
--Protect the restaurant!!

191
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,830
Th-That's...

192
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,370
Hmm...

193
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,710
Just what're you guys doing?

194
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,970
What's with that guy?

195
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,140
Unassailable! Hence invincible!

196
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,930
When someone says,
"Pearl-san, the Invincible Shield

197
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,560
of the Krieg Pirates," they mean me!

198
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,270
Pearl-san!

199
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,230
Patty! Carne! Are you all right?!

200
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:12,200
They're not all right, because they
took my killer punch, "Pearl Surprise."

201
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,280
Whoa! This is a nice knife. I'll take it.

202
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,040
Hmm? Hey, let go. Give it to me!
Let it go, you damn loser!

203
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,540
He's really got some good kicks!

204
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,180
I didn't come to like him for nothing!

205
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,720
A kitchen knife is a cook's soul.

206
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,190
Don't you amateurs
carelessly put hands on it!

207
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,900
Sanji...

208
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,710
Hold this tight and stay down there.

209
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,610
I'll take care of them.

210
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,080
We won't be beaten by a mere cook!

211
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,630
A mere cook, you said? I'm gonna
cut you in three, you bastards!

212
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,480
Ha! How impudent you are
to beat them using only kicks.

213
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,220
Is that your policy?

214
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,140
To cooks, hands are most important.
I can't have them hurt in battle.

215
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,190
I'll take you down with this leg as well.

216
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,150
Take me down? That's impossible.

217
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,070
I'm an invincible man that won
all 61 of my battles unharmed.

218
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,240
I've never shed blood in
a battle, not even a drop.

219
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,420
Winning unharmed is
the very proof of my power.

220
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,090
I'm a shield man and a gentleman.
I'm refined, aren't I?

221
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,550
Was that supposed to be a gag?
It wasn't funny at all.

222
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,460
Hey, straw hat brat!

223
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,220
If you're not paying
attention, you'll get hurt!

224
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,230
Even battleship cannons
don't work on me.

225
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,900
I come out of any attack unharmed!

226
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,110
Boy, that startled me.
Good thing I didn't fall in the sea.

227
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,280
What?

228
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,740
Ahh... This isn't good.

229
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,200
Blood! Oh, no!

230
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,710
Pearl-san, don't worry.

231
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,670
--It's just a nosebleed!
--It's not a wound from fighting!

232
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,170
--Please calm down, Pearl-san!
--What's going on?

233
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,130
Th-Th-Th-These guys are dangerous!

234
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,070
What's with him? He's acting strange.

235
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,600
What about his nosebleed?

236
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,020
Stop it, Pearl! It's just a nosebleed!
Don't lose your cool!

237
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,480
What the heck is he about to do?

238
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,490
Danger! Danger! Danger!!

239
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,070
Oh, no! It's started!

240
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,210
When Pearl-san gets upset,
he catches fire!

241
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,170
What was that?

242
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:19,600
Fire Pearls... Special Treat!!

243
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,090
Ouch!

244
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,980
Pearl-san! Please stop!

245
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,950
Burn! With this flame
and the flame shield,

246
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,020
you have no idea how invincible I am!

247
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,980
That idiot! Is he going to burn down
the ship that we're gonna take over?

248
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,860
--Ow, ow, ow, ow...
--Dammit!

249
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,480
Crap! There's no escape from a sea
of flames in the middle of the sea!

250
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,870
This isn't good!
The restaurant will catch fire!

251
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,830
This restaurant will burn?

252
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,130
--Burn! Burn!
--You son of a bitch!

253
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,750
You idiot! You'll get burned, Sanji!

254
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,630
I'm not just gonna let you...
burn this restaurant down!

255
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,970
H-He's so reckless!

256
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,600
Does he want to turn
into a human torch?!

257
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,060
When even fierce animals would
stay away from Fire Pearls...

258
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,030
You fool! I'd be unfit to be
a cook if I was afraid of flames!

259
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,490
D-Dammit! What a refined guy he is!

260
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,320
Here I come!

261
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,290
Ahh! That hit him good!

262
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,750
He broke through
Invincible Pearl-san's wall!

263
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,260
What's with this cook? He's really crazy.

264
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Y-Y-You son of a bitch!
Fire! I need more fire!

265
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,670
I need to feed more Fire Pearls!

266
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,270
Ahh! The restaurant will catch fire!

267
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,650
If the fire gets into the kitchen,
the restaurant will be blown away!

268
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,650
Owner! Please get out of there! Owner!!

269
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,830
M-My Fire Pearls...

270
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,330
Something like that is child's play!

271
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,300
The gust from his kick
put out the flame!

272
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,690
What the hell?! That's
definitely a divine technique!

273
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,260
So Red Foot Zeff is still strong?!

274
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,220
Pops is really cool! I'm impressed!

275
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,450
Now that it's come to this,
I'll sink you all with the fins

276
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,820
before the restaurant catches fire!

277
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,030
Sanji! Watch out!!

278
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,990
Oh, no! He's surrounded by fire!

279
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,370
--Ow, ow, ow...
--Chore boy!

280
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,960
Gum-Gum... Bazooka!

281
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,290
--Ow, ow, ow...
--He hit that iron ball back!

282
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,800
Ow, ow, ow!

283
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,690
Pearl-san is really down this time!

284
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,650
--Pearl-san is...
--Pearl-san is...

285
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,460
What the heck?

286
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,110
That guy sure is dumb.

287
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,570
Geez... They're all...

288
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,080
In the end, I can only count on myself...

289
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,000
The battle ends here.

290
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,410
That's right! Shoot Red Foot Zeff!

291
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,020
All we need to do is kill him.
Then the restaurant will be ours!

292
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,250
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

293
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,970
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

294
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:38,310
before someone else could
beat me to it

295
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:52,490
If the world is going to change

296
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:06,630
before I can even attain my dream

297
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,680
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

298
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,020
so that my memories won't fade

299
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,570
There's no way I'm gonna
let them take this restaurant!

300
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,960
Taking a hostage! That's dirty!
I'm gonna kick that bastard's ass!

301
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,780
Butt out, chore boy!
Keep your hands out of this!

302
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,450
Then, is it okay to use my legs?

303
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,370
I'm gonna cut you in three,
you damn Straw Hat!

304
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,460
I can't let the damn geezer's
purpose in life get taken away!

305
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,790
On the next episode of One Piece!

306
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,920
"Zeff and Sanji's Dream;
The Illusory All Blue"

307
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
