2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,290
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,780
After being ejected from the Sabaody
Archipelago by Bartholomew Kuma,

51
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,890
Luffy was separated from
his friends and arrived alone

52
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,990
at the female-only empire of Amazon Lily.

53
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,250
After his capture,

54
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,660
it appeared that Luffy had
successfully escaped, but...

55
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,640
The Snake Princess is about to bathe!

56
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,380
Is this a bath?

57
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,220
A man!

58
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,360
Hey...

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,300
That thing on your back...

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,610
It seems familiar somehow...

61
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,290
You saw it, didn't you?!

62
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,570
"Heartless Judgment!
Margaret is Turned to Stone!!"

63
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,540
Big Sis!

64
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,380
Big Sis! What happened?!

65
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,950
Who is that? A man?!

66
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,400
What is a man doing in this land?!

67
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,890
What in the world happened?!

68
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,650
Oh, I, uhh...

69
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,310
He saw my back.

70
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,450
Then he'll have to die.

71
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,370
Huh?! H-How come?! I only saw her back!

72
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,200
I dunno why,

73
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,710
but I could swear I've seen it
somewhere before...

74
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,500
We would rather die

75
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,140
than let anyone see
what you saw on my back!

76
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,850
That thing? How come?

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,670
Who are you? How come?

78
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,420
Take everything you saw to the grave!

79
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,140
Love-Love Beam!

80
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,510
Slow-Slow?!

81
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,520
A Slow-Slow Beam?!

82
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,620
Oh no!

83
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,060
I'm turning slower! Slow...er...

84
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,740
Love-Love Beam!

85
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,310
Why won't he petrify?!

86
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,690
Does he not feel any excitement
from seeing me in the bath?!

87
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,250
That's not possible, Big Sis!

88
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,620
The beauty of your naked body would
charm anyone of any age or gender!

89
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,680
His fear of death must be
overpowering his wicked thoughts!

90
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,620
He's a pathetic, yet lucky man!

91
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,000
I dunno what's going on,
but I'm getting outta here!

92
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,460
I just wanna talk to someone important!

93
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,340
He jumped out from this height!

94
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,890
He won't get away!

95
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,420
Pistol Kiss!

96
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,160
Huh?! They don't bounce off!

97
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,530
They're not metal bullets?!

98
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,480
That man is an intruder!

99
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,990
Seize him, Kuja Pirates!

100
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,530
Y-Yes, ma'am!

101
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,270
A man?! What's a man doing here?!

102
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,700
Let's just catch him for now!

103
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,380
That hurt!

104
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,290
It's in your best interest to do as we say!

105
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,330
Ran! No man would ever try
to defy the Kuja Pirates!

106
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,090
Besides, he looks weak anyway!

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,030
It's a man!

108
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,600
A live man in the village...!

109
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,930
Are you the all-women pirate group?

110
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,900
Do you know where your boss is?

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,270
Why do you want to know that?!

112
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,750
Your boss owns a ship, right?

113
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,730
So I wanna find her

114
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,020
and ask for a ride on her ship
and hurry onto the sea!

115
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,840
What nonsense!

116
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,800
Men are forbidden in Amazon Lily!

117
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,180
Do you honestly think
you'll get to leave alive?!

118
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,560
Stupid man!

119
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,280
This is no time for me to get caught!

120
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,830
Gum-Gum...

121
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,540
Seize him!

122
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,050
...Rocket!

123
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,260
What the...?!

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,220
After him! Quickly!

125
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,470
The Snake Princess's orders!

126
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,290
Don't let him escape, no matter what!

127
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,760
A man!

128
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,130
There's a male intruder!

129
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,260
A male?!

130
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,970
The Kuja Pirates are chasing him!

131
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,440
Let's help out, too!

132
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,070
Alright! Let's go!

133
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,980
Of all things, allowing a man onto the
island when the Kuja are in peril...

134
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,630
This is unprecedented.

135
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,860
I can't help but worry what
the future holds for this land.

136
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,140
Catch the man!

137
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,680
The Kuja Pirates!

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,980
So he did return to the village...

139
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,840
There he is!

140
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,000
Over there!

141
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,630
I would've thought she'd
be in a tall building...

142
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,360
Where do I go to meet someone important?

143
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,650
Those pirates caught up to me already?!

144
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,290
Let's kill him before the
Snake Princess catches him!

145
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,240
Oh, it's them again?!

146
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,650
He fell off!

147
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,700
There he is! The man!

148
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,600
Crap!

149
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,260
Halt!

150
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,840
Wait, you!

151
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,980
It can't be!

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,510
Why would this rookie worth
300 million be in Amazon Lily?!

153
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,740
There he is!

154
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,940
Well, I gotta run!

155
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,010
Wait! Let me see your face again!

156
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,050
I said wait!

157
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,190
Even the old ladies here are strong?

158
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,070
There's no escape now!

159
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,290
Oh no! The Kuja Pirates caught him!

160
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,910
I guess there's nothing we can do now!

161
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,730
This man really is...

162
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,930
Damn! Come off, you stupid things!

163
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,230
What are these iron rope-like snakes?!

164
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,800
We were too slow.

165
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,450
Let's just hope they don't
ask how he arrived here...

166
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,570
He's going to be killed, isn't he?

167
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,880
What's with this place?

168
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,510
There really isn't even one guy here.

169
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,180
Snake Princess!

170
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,730
Marigold-sama!

171
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,140
Sandersonia-sama!

172
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,610
Let me ask you this, man.

173
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,520
How and why did you come to this island?!

174
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,280
Seriously, I don't know, either!

175
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,190
I suddenly went flying through the sky

176
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,070
and before I realized it, I was here!

177
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,000
Lies.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,100
You can't fool me with that ridiculous story.

179
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,280
You must be after something.

180
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,630
Well, you could give me a ship!

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,590
I'd appreciate getting a lift most of all,

182
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,930
but anyway, there's a place
I need to leave for right away!

183
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,270
If you're the most important person here,

184
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,000
then please! I want to set sail!

185
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,630
What nonsense is this?!

186
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,350
The Snake Princess is right!

187
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,220
He's obviously lying!

188
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,190
He must be plotting something!

189
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,140
You can't fool us!

190
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,660
Oh, I've been thanking you non-stop!

191
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,730
Is there anything I can do for you?

192
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,000
As long as the others are
still alive like I am,

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,200
that's all that matters.

194
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,940
As long as they're alive,

195
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,460
I can keep fighting again and again!

196
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,030
How dare he speak so rudely and
tastelessly to the Snake Princess?!

197
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,320
He's appalling!

198
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,380
Don't think you can leave this place alive.

199
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,570
Your death is inescapable!

200
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,360
Please wait, Snake Princess!

201
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,470
I-I don't think he's the
kind of person who can lie!

202
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,720
Margaret!

203
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,830
Snake Princess...

204
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,400
Snake Princess.

205
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,860
E-Everything this man says is sincere.

206
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,730
He hardly seems like the type
to bring harm to our land!

207
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,400
Oh! You!

208
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,980
Yeah! Tell her for me!

209
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,940
A defense warrior?

210
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,690
My name is Margaret!

211
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,900
Men are forbidden here.

212
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,500
His death sentence was set in stone

213
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,370
the moment he stepped foot on this land.

214
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,910
Why do you protect him?

215
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,070
I feel I owe him.

216
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,670
The person who let him into this country...

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,930
...was I!

218
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,550
Margaret! Why?!

219
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,600
Snake Princess! W-We can explain!

220
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,790
Yes!

221
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,950
We found him in the forest
covered in mushrooms!

222
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,570
We thought he was from the village
and carried him here!

223
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,950
Sweetpea! Aphelandra!

224
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,080
We're also responsible for
the crime of bringing him here!

225
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,530
That's right!

226
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,390
Stop, you two!

227
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm the one who suggested
bringing him to the village!

228
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,250
Does she know what this means?

229
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,960
Margaret is way too honest!

230
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,130
Oh, you guys!

231
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,780
You guys tried to kill me,
but you're actually nice after all!

232
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,580
Only I'm guilty of letting
him into the country!

233
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,740
Margaret!

234
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,190
It's all right.

235
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,670
Look up, honest Margaret.

236
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,660
I like honest people.

237
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,180
Tell me.

238
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,400
Do you wish for forgiveness?

239
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,080
Y-Yes...

240
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,890
You may rise.

241
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,780
Is the Snake Princess going to forgive
those three for their great crimes?!

242
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,030
That's the Snake Princess for you!

243
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,830
She's not only beautiful,
she's so compassionate too!

244
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,040
Snake Princess!

245
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,330
Love-Love Beam!

246
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,510
What the...?!

247
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,470
The fools...

248
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,790
Hey! What happened to you guys?!

249
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,390
What happened?!

250
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,470
They turned to stone! How come?!

251
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,370
Hey...

252
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,190
Hey...!

253
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,840
Hey, you! What did you do to them?!

254
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,330
They saved my life, you know!

255
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,400
Yes.

256
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,980
They were punished
because they helped you.

257
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,310
It's my fault that they...

258
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,670
Wait! Turn them back to normal!

259
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,460
Just who do you think
you're giving orders to?

260
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,640
Turn them back now!

261
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,890
Bring out Bakula!

262
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,210
Bakula?!

263
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,140
It's all over for that man now!

264
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,230
I told you to turn them back!

265
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,460
This is the warrior nation of Amazon Lily.

266
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,900
The strong are beautiful.

267
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,970
Fight your hardest and perish.

268
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,190
We will watch and see you off.

269
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,170
That black panther's name is Bakula.

270
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,030
A carnivorous beast that
has served as executioner

271
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,390
for this land's empresses for generations.

272
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,800
After each execution,
not even a single bone remains.

273
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,520
Bakula seems to be quite starved.

274
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,710
Yes, Big Sis.

275
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,190
I'm told it hasn't been fed
for several days now.

276
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,840
Be happy, man!

277
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,230
Bakula will gladly eat even
a scrawny monkey like you!

278
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,880
Never mind that...!

279
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,010
What about these guys?!
Will they go back to normal?!

280
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,260
How dare he speak so rudely
to the Snake Princess?!

281
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,970
Get 'im, Bakula!

282
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,090
Bakula!

283
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,550
Go!

284
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,660
He's strong!

285
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,980
He knocked out Bakula in one hit!

286
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,250
He didn't use Haki!

287
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,190
Then that was just brute strength?!

288
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,640
You guys are screwed up.

289
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,910
That woman...

290
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,290
She turned your comrades into stone,

291
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,200
so how can you all sit
there and laugh like that?!

292
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,510
Th-The savage man is yelling at us!

293
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,590
Unbelievable! What a vicious creature!

294
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,820
I feel bad about those three,

295
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
but the Snake Princess was
right to do what she did!

296
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,050
They're the ones to blame!
They broke the rules of our land!

297
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,820
Whatever I do...

298
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,270
...I will be forgiven.

299
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,690
The reason for that is,

300
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,600
yes...

301
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,050
...because I'm beautiful!

302
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,200
Snake Princess!

303
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,470
Wouldn't you agree, too?

304
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,830
You piss me off!

305
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,710
Big Sis! Stay strong!

306
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,100
This can't be!

307
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,300
No man exists that won't be my slave!

308
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,770
I cannot stand that man's existence!

309
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,420
How dare you say that to the Snake Princess?!

310
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,640
Hurry and execute him!

311
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,690
Execution!

312
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,360
Execution! Execution!

313
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,720
Go! Marigold! Sandersonia!

314
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,660
Take that man's head!

315
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,770
Yes! Leave it to us, Big Sis!

316
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,800
These guys have powers?

317
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,320
Execution!

318
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,430
Execution!

319
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,530
Execution!

320
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,420
Execution!...

321
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,570
Sandersonia and Marigold transform
using the power of the

322
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,170
Snake-Snake Fruit, in order to execute Luffy.

323
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,890
Luffy does his best to
dodge and counter-attack.

324
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,560
However, it proves useless.

325
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

326
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,250
"A Difficult Fight for Luffy!
The Snake Sisters' Haki Power!!"

327
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,370
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
