00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:21,180
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,170
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,950
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,210
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people take up weapons.

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,320
The scorching land was now
engulfed in wails of grief,

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,370
along with tremendous upheaval.

27
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,130
Crocodile's plan was
finally being carried out,

28
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,120
and Bon Clay,
transformed into the false king,

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,340
had appeared in Nanohana.

30
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,370
A rebel army had also risen up.

31
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,060
Meanwhile, Vivi was escaping,

32
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,640
in order to tell Sanji about the peril
that Luffy and the others were in,

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,490
having been caught in
a trap within Raindinners.

34
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,020
Will Alabasta fall?

35
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,060
Or will it find true peace?

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,390
Moment by moment, the hourglass
of fate marks the final hour.

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,490
I'm... I'm Mr. Prince!

38
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,790
"The Key to a Great Comeback Escape!
The Wax-Wax Ball!"

39
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,260
Tony-kun is a decoy?

40
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,960
Yeah. He'll be fine.

41
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,950
Let's hurry, Vivi-chan.

42
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,120
Explain the situation to me.

43
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,530
But Sanji-san, you were
shot earlier, weren't you?

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,240
Me?

45
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,530
Hello?

46
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,570
We've caught him!

47
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,230
What should we do
with this strange man?!

48
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,750
Where are you? Tell me!

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,350
T-The front gate of a casino
in Rainbase, named Raindinners!

50
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,090
All right, nicely done.

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,910
That was a star performance.

52
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,310
Now your boss will show up here.

53
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,740
T-Thanks so much.

54
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,280
So, can I go now?

55
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,830
No, sir.

56
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,100
Yeah, guess not...

57
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,810
Look, Chopper.

58
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,980
His friends are
starting to crowd around again

59
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,910
in the same place that
we were just running wild.

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,340
Mm-hmm...

61
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,740
Next, it's whatever I can manage.

62
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,640
That's right.

63
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,330
I'm counting on you.

64
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,030
Who are you?

65
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,220
M-My name is Mr. Prince.

66
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,380
Huh? So then, you're the one
who did all this to my companions?

67
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,960
Whatever I can manage...

68
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,110
My name is Mr. Prince!

69
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,360
My name is Mr. Prince!

70
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,840
What is the meaning of this?

71
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,770
I-It was a man,
calling himself Mr. Prince...

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,310
Him?!

73
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,830
Bad news! The bridge collapsed!

74
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,000
And that's more or less what happened.

75
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,620
Is Tony-kun all right?

76
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,420
Yeah.

77
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,230
He has some tricks up
his sleeve, after all.

78
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,690
I hear something happened
over at Raindinners.

79
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,570
They say the bridge collapsed.

80
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,440
You bastard...

81
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,170
Where did you go, Mr. Prince...?

82
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,500
I swear, I'm going to
find you, and kill you.

83
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,970
--The water! The water!
--We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

84
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,430
Once this cage is submerged,
it's all over for us!

85
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,140
Hey, you stupid gator! Come and get me!

86
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,230
What's come over you, Nami?!

87
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm making that guy mad,
to get him to bite the cage apart!

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
I get it! Great idea!

89
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,300
Come and get me, you stupid banana!

90
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,080
You rotten banana!

91
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,990
No, that's wrong!

92
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,450
I told you, he's basically an alligator,
with a banana on his head.

93
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,720
What?! Would you shut up?

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,280
For example,
there's the monkey dance, right?

95
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,950
You rotten banana!

96
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,950
Listen to what I'm saying!

97
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,950
What?

98
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,830
For example,
there's the monkey dance, right?

99
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,130
A monkey is an animal,
but the monkey dance is a dance, and--

100
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,930
Don't touch that!
Learn something, will you?!

101
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,720
You eat both alligators
and bananas, don't you?!

102
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,630
Here he comes!

103
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,450
It's no use!

104
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,540
What a tough cage!

105
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,690
Vivi! Please hurry!

106
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,400
Hey, you guys...

107
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,210
How can you keep so composed?!

108
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,530
You think up something, too!

109
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,900
How much do you guys know?

110
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,450
What exactly is Crocodile after?

111
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
That woman who was at Crocodile's side...

112
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,870
She's had a price on her head by
the World Government for 20 years.

113
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,810
The price was over 70,000,000, as I recall.

114
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,380
S-Seventy million?!

115
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,700
S-So what about it?

116
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,760
That's the same price that Crocodile has.

117
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,270
The moment those two joined forces,

118
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,850
this became more than just a simple coup.

119
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,950
This can only develop into
a matter that the whole world

120
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,560
will get dragged into, if they're left to it.

121
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,150
The whole world? What do you mean?

122
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,330
That does seem a little far-fetched.

123
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,070
What are you guys talking about?

124
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,330
I don't need any excuse
like that to kick his ass!

125
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,300
I see...

126
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,320
So, how are we getting out of here?

127
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,260
It's up to my thighs!

128
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,300
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

129
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm kind of starting to lose my nerve.

130
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,270
This is bad! This is bad!

131
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,150
Tough it out! Didn't Vivi say so?!

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,170
Must be hard for you, huh, Vivi?

133
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,900
I'm sorry, I know you
don't have time for this.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,100
Damn it!

135
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,410
if only my swordsmanship were better,
this cage would be nothing!

136
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,880
Try as hard as you can not to
make any noise at mealtime.

137
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,610
Bad Manner Kick Course!!

138
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,180
Hey there.

139
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,660
Been waiting long?

140
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,790
Prince!!

141
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,180
Thank goodness.

142
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,790
Stop goofing around
and find the key already!

143
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,750
Nami-san!

144
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,650
L-Love me now?

145
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,050
Yeah, yeah, I'm in love,
now hurry and open this up!

146
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,480
Okay!

147
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,730
The guy is an interminable idiot, huh?

148
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,220
Vivi! Way to go!

149
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,900
Here they come, one after the next.

150
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,200
Go, Sanji! Pound them all!

151
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,520
Bunch together as much as you like,

152
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
and come get me, you damn bananas.

153
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,390
Anyone with manners as poor as yours,
who would attack a lady,

154
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,450
gets some table manners
beaten into them, but good.

155
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,340
Sanji! There isn't any time for that!

156
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,640
One-second strikes!
No, make that one-instant strikes!

157
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,040
Take out the third one who just came in.

158
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,460
What? You can tell?

159
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,240
Are your ears just for show?

160
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,610
His growl is the same as the one
who swallowed the key, isn't it?

161
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,750
I can't really tell.

162
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,440
Smart thinking, collapsing the
bridge and buying time like that.

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,750
There are more of their friends here.

164
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,510
Was that to catch us off guard,
and get to the room?

165
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,630
Probably.

166
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,050
There it is!

167
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,930
The key to the cage!

168
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,690
What is that?!

169
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,390
That doesn't look like a key!

170
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,530
Wax-Wax Ball!!

171
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,990
Release!

172
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,030
What?!

173
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,220
Oh! W-Water! It's water!

174
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,960
It's a miracle!

175
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,930
Hey, it's him!

176
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,460
Three! It's Three!

177
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,880
Mr. 3! What was he doing
in the belly of an alligator?!

178
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm alive again!

179
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,050
I thought I was dead there!

180
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,180
That rotten Crocodile!

181
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,410
He may have tried to get rid of me,
but he didn't try hard enough!

182
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,660
The moment I was swallowed,

183
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,810
I squeezed out the last of my
power to create this Wax-Wax Ball.

184
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,670
What's this?

185
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,130
Hand that key over to us!

186
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,360
It's you guys!

187
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,330
What? This key...?

188
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,040
Hold on...

189
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,740
A room, forcefully leaking water...

190
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,300
...an iron cage...

191
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,290
and this key...

192
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,390
I know what's going on, now.

193
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,150
You're Mr. 3, are you?

194
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,530
You startled me!

195
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,520
Are you Mr. 3?
Hand over the key, quietly.

196
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,040
Gleam!

197
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,160
Here comes a long throw!

198
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,400
What?!

199
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,330
I don't know who you are,
but you appear to be on their side!

200
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,340
If you want the key, go find it!

201
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,800
However, whether or not you are able
to find it, I won't be responsible!

202
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,050
You bastard...

203
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,350
What if this person is able
to pick out the alligator

204
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,910
that swallowed the key?

205
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,820
Hmph, it wouldn't do any good.

206
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,540
Even if they were lucky
enough to get that key,

207
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,500
the real key is right here.
Let them struggle as hard as they want.

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,460
You are bad.

209
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,210
It flew away, it flew away!

210
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,610
That bastard...

211
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,530
That was smart,
for coming out of nowhere.

212
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,550
There's no time, Sanji-kun!

213
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,300
That was a good-for-nothing thing to pull...

214
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,840
Just a minute, Sanji!

215
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,390
Couldn't his wax-wax power
make a key to this cage?

216
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,360
Indeed.

217
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,410
Nicely done, candle man.

218
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,760
Let's get moving. There's little time.

219
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,590
Yeah. I'm sure the first route
they took is toward Alubarna.

220
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,070
But there are still so many
bananagators that way!

221
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,670
Aren't there any more?!

222
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,440
That wasn't enough!

223
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,660
Looks like we needn't worry.

224
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,060
And after I had that much
trouble with one of them...!

225
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,000
No, their strength is just abnormal,
so don't worry about it.

226
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,160
Dammit, I can't go all-out,
soaked in water like this!

227
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,970
The walls are crumbling!

228
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,930
Idiot, that's overdoing it.

229
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,070
The passageway is crumbling, too!

230
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,390
Out! We're getting out of here!

231
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,690
Those small fry... They're going to pay!

232
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,620
I'll kill them all, right now,
with my own hands!

233
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,550
What...?

234
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,510
"Catch you later, you damn gator.
Mr. Prince"

235
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,410
Hey, you still alive, Luffy?

236
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,330
Usopp-san, wake up!

237
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,960
Good grief, what are you doing?!

238
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,960
Swim, like you're supposed to!

239
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,920
Sheesh, you guys with your abilities
sure bear some hard risks, huh?

240
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,330
Whoa, Smoker!

241
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,090
Hey now, Zoro, what are you
bringing the enemy along for?!

242
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,830
Back off! I didn't want to.

243
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,070
He was this close to dying, after all.

244
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,460
Whatever. Let's just hurry on ahead.

245
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,780
We've lost quite a bit of time.
Vivi-chan, can we still make it?

246
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,100
I don't know.

247
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,970
Nami-san...

248
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,360
Do you still have that perfume
I bought you in Nanohana?

249
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,000
Huh? Yeah. Why?

250
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,950
Put some of it on.

251
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,100
Like this?

252
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,370
It makes me fall in love
to the ends of the world!

253
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,670
Come on, get going, seriously.

254
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,800
Roronoa!

255
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,300
Why did you save my life?

256
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,940
Hey, Zoro! Save him!

257
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,020
Huh?! He's our enemy! Leave him be!

258
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,020
If we leave him there,
he's gonna die, you know!

259
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,290
He can't swim!

260
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,260
Yeah, well, I know that,

261
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,280
but he's...

262
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,480
I was just following the captain's orders.

263
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,550
I don't think you necessarily
have to thank me.

264
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,520
It was one of his whims. Pay it no mind.

265
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,310
Then, you'd have no gripes with me
carrying out my duties here, right?

266
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,030
See? Didn't I tell you?
That's what you get for saving a marine.

267
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,240
They're here? The Straw Hat pirates?

268
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,960
Yeah! Captain Smoker
is right there, with them!

269
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
Let's go back him up!

270
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,050
All right, men! Full speed to Alubarna!

271
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,010
Where is Crocodile?!

272
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,210
Ah, they came around.

273
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,340
Smokey! You want some of this?!

274
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,320
Wah! It's Smoker!

275
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,280
Hey, Luffy, don't do it! Let's get out of here!

276
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,240
Just how serious is he?

277
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,080
This way! Hurry!

278
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,050
Go.

279
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,860
But this is the only time I'm letting you off.

280
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,680
Next time we meet,
consider yourselves dead.

281
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,120
There they are!

282
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,280
Don't let them escape!

283
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,500
Come on, let's go. The marines are coming.

284
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,960
Which way is Alubarna?

285
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,420
Over there! Straight to the east!

286
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,350
Hey, Luffy! Hurry! What are you doing?!

287
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,580
Yeah...

288
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,960
They won't get away this time!

289
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,360
You're not unlikable, you know?

290
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,200
Get going, already!

291
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,740
Don't let them get away!

292
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,070
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

293
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,160
All right, guys!

294
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,050
Head straight for Alubarna!

295
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,850
I always wanted to talk about it

296
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,660
I couldn't even say half of it

297
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:42,180
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

298
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:55,560
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

299
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,770
Glory glory you're my shine

300
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:06,530
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

301
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:12,280
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

302
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,580
I'm sure I'll make it there

303
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,960
It's Crocodile!

304
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,040
Aah! He's come after us!

305
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,400
I can handle him alone!
You guys go on ahead!

306
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,700
That idiot!

307
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,660
Let's keep on moving, to Alubarna!

308
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,760
We're leaving him behind?!

309
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,600
Luffy-san! We'll be
waiting for you in Alubarna!

310
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,560
Yeah!

311
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,320
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,650
"Merciless Mortal Combat!
Luffy vs. Crocodile"

313
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,090
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
