The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Freedom is our only compass,
We are best friends

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

something - that's the treasure

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,480

I'll never lose!

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

Yes, Shining! Running! Forever

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

53

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,640
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,650
Luffy and the others formed
a pirate alliance with

75
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,860
Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,970
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,000
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,740
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law who's been

79
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,570
captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,280
Count on us to destroy the factory!

81
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,350
All of you, be safe!

82
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,400
Roger that!

83
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,630
Roger that!

84
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,530
Tra-guy's life...

85
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,350
Rebecca's wish...

86
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,320
He holds the key to all of that!

87
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,490
We're gonna head for the palace!

88
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,890
And beat the hell out of Doflamingo!

89
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,850
At the Colosseum, the final round
of the competition started.

90
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,040
Meanwhile,
the Tontattas' Operation SOP is...

91
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,270
Cyborg Franky has been silenced!

92
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,990
U-Usopp! I know you can do it!

93
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,280
Set off the panic already!

94
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,920
Don't worry, Young Master.

95
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,790
He's not even conscious now.

96
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,720
Usoland!

97
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,730
You can have this poison grape back.

98
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,970
--Oh, the Tatababasco grape!
--Our only hope!

99
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,170
You eat this.

100
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,750
Drop dead.

101
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,590
"The Legend is Back!
Kyros' All-out Blow!"

102
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,970
When Sugar passes out,

103
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,550
that's when all the toys in the country will
turn back into Big Humans!

104
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,490
All his evildoing will be revealed

105
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,940
and the pirate - Doflamingo
- will show his true colors!

106
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,830
What will Doflamingo do?

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,300
What action the Navy will take?

108
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,340
What will the people in this country think
and do?

109
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,340
Will they go crazy and riot?

110
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,150
Or will they give up and surrender?

111
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,710
Or will they...

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,430
...fight together with us?!

113
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,710
S... S...

114
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,860
Sugar has passed out!!

115
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,080
I've turned back!

116
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,910
What?!

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,090
This is...

118
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,100
What is going on?!
They're transforming one after another!

119
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,450
The toys are...

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,540
...Getting bigger and bigger!

121
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,310
I've turned back!

122
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,910
What's going on?!

123
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,480
You bastard!

124
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,150
Thank you for pushing
me around all this time!

125
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,970
Brother, don't use violence!

126
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,240
Oops, I've held the wrong one!

127
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,540
You son of a bitch!

128
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,570
Flapper?!

129
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,570
Leo!

130
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,650
Leo! I'm so relieved!

131
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,850
Finally!

132
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,170
We accomplished Operation SOP!

133
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,020
Sugar! Hey, wake up! Sugar!

134
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,890
Hey! Hey!

135
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,810
This is no good!

136
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,760
What's going on?!

137
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,000
What is it?

138
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,330
What is happening here-dara?

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,690
What the...!

140
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,820
He's turned into a weird old man!

141
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,540
What's going on?

142
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,770
I've turned back!

143
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,620
Wait!

144
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,690
Ring, ring, ring... Ring,
ring, ring... Clank.

145
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,930
S-Sugar has...

146
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,060
I'm sorry, Doffy!

147
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,430
You're too loud, Trebol!

148
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,800
What happened to Sugar?

149
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,690
P... P...

150
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,840
Passed out!

151
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,240
She has passed out!

152
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,210
--What? What happened?
--Sugar has passed out?!

153
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,900
Hey...

154
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,450
Is this some kind of joke?!

155
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,620
The servants that we've been
collecting for a decade

156
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,330
are turning back into humans!

157
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,900
The spell of the Hobby-Hobby
Fruit is being removed!

158
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,290
The Tontattas' operation must've
been pulled off!

159
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,640
See? I told you
Usopp would take care of it!

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,640
Young Master, look at the Colosseum!

161
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,510
I've turned back!

162
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,170
--Honey!
--I remember now!

163
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,350
Wh-What is going on here?

164
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,230
Oh! Um...

165
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,570
What is happening here?!
The toys are...

166
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,000
The toys are turning into humans!

167
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,900
Not just humans!

168
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,060
Don't tell me Sugar has...

169
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,630
A decade of our hard work...

170
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,410
Sugar must've been beaten
by somebody-in!

171
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,470
How pathetic that shitty little tramp is!

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,700
But...

173
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,490
...I hope she's not hurt.

174
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,090
Boy!
You said such an unkind thing but...

175
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,000
...you actually care about her!
So hard-boiled!

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,700
--Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...
--Palace, please answer!

177
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,070
We keep getting emergency reports!

178
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,710
This is an emergency call
from Sevio in the south!

179
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,680
The toys working at the port
suddenly turned into pirates!

180
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,980
--Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...
--This is Carta in the east!

181
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,690
The toys turned into old Dressrosa soldiers!

182
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,620
They turned into gov't officials!

183
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,520
Navy soldiers and
senior officials from abroad!

184
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,720
Wild animals! This is Primula District!

185
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,560
Are they real?!

186
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,700
Young Master!

187
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,550
I've turned back into a human!

188
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,110
I'm so glad!

189
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,660
--Stay with me, Usopp!
--Usoland!

190
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,930
Usoland!

191
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,590
Me and everybody else, we all turned
back into humans thanks to you!

192
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,910
--Usoland!
--Usoland!

193
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,930
You did it!

194
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,680
Operation SOP has been accomplished!

195
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,660
Everybody turned back into a human
and they're all happy!

196
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,260
What's the matter, Onepoko?

197
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,410
Hey Mom, Onepoko is acting strange!

198
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,620
What?! Onepoko!

199
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,090
One...poko? One...poko?

200
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,910
One... No! My darling!

201
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,230
I-I've turned back!

202
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,080
Honey!

203
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,010
D-Dad! You're not Onepoko!

204
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,800
--Yes, I'm your dad!
--Dad!

205
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,120
Why have we forgotten about you
all this time?!

206
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,170
That's how the spell worked!
I thought I was gonna live as a toy forever!

207
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,300
--Hey Dad! Can you lift me up high?!
--Alright!

208
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,810
There you go!

209
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,160
Damn! You're quiet again?

210
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,730
Where did you go, stone guy!

211
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,890
Usopp... Little People...

212
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,510
Operation Sugar Oversurprised
and Panic went...

213
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,960
...super well, I guess.

214
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,450
--Usopp, stay with me!
--Usoland!

215
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,200
I think... I can't... carry on...
anymore...

216
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,840
Usoland! Please wake up!

217
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,920
--Don't die!
--I don't want you to die!

218
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,710
Usoland has died!

219
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,410
Guys!

220
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,210
Excuse me...

221
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,160
I'm... still alive.

222
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,510
Usolan...d?

223
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,790
The hero's still alive!

224
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,010
Usopp!

225
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,380
Usoland! Thank you for everything!

226
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,620
Everything... went as planned!

227
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,790
So cool!!

228
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,060
Leave the rest... to my friends.

229
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,470
The battle has...

230
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,350
...just begun.

231
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,220
Okay!

232
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,380
Help!

233
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,650
What?

234
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,790
Run!

235
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,600
Hm? You!

236
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,420
Huh? Who are you?!

237
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,550
I'm Onepoko, the dog you've
been pushing around!

238
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,620
Just carry it, Onepoko!

239
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,260
What?! You are?!

240
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,660
How dare you boss me around...

241
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,700
...Like I was your slave!

242
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,430
I can forgive everyone else but you!

243
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,490
Palace! Send some backup ASAP!
The pirates are out of...

244
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,570
Hey!

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,760
It's not enough yet!

246
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,390
Guys!

247
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,380
Beat the hell out of Doflamingo's men!

248
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,910
Hey! What's wrong?! Answer me! Hey!

249
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,130
How could you treat me so violently?!

250
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,760
You bastard!

251
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,080
Esta!

252
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,850
--Oh yeah!
--What?

253
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,070
--I have a boyfriend!
--Huh?!

254
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,330
You cheated on me!

255
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,540
I'm sorry! I forgot about you!

256
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,310
I was forgotten for a decade!
I hate Doflamingo!

257
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,420
Take down Doflamingo!

258
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,230
We were fooled by Doflamingo!

259
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,040
What are you talking about?
He's a good king.

260
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,630
You just don't know who he really is!

261
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,230
He's... a devil!

262
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,800
Kill Doflamingo!

263
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,970
Come on out, Doflamingo!

264
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,940
I've gotta pay you back
10 years' worth of pain!

265
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,310
Issho-san, what is happening here-dara?

266
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,990
I guess the tides have changed.

267
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:00,390
The darkness of this country must be
much deeper than I thought.

268
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,130
The darkness-dara?

269
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,010
--Kill Doflamingo's men!
--Let them all shed their blood!

270
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,850
Beautiful!

271
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,770
Let's take our country back!

272
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,980
Bring down Doflamingo!

273
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,870
Damn those pieces of shit!

274
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,070
Soldier-san is a brave man

275
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,030
He will always be by your side

276
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,910
Soldier-san is a brave man

277
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,420
He will always be by your side

278
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,090
I had been forgetting everything!

279
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm Kyros! King Riku-sama!

280
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,730
--Kyros?
--Yes!

281
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,550
I'm sorry. It doesn't ring a bell.

282
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,700
Now, I remember clearly!

283
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,050
What?!

284
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,090
Who is he?!

285
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,980
Brother Kyros!

286
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,450
Even I lost my memories of him!

287
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,480
What are you talking about?!
What do you mean?!

288
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,990
Oh? Where did the soldier go?!

289
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,820
--It's him.
--Huh? That's a human!

290
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,930
The toys were originally humans

291
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,830
but they were erased from our memories!

292
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,930
Since the Devil Fruit eater Sugar
passed out now,

293
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,490
we got our memories back!

294
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,410
He's the former commander of
the King Riku Army - Kyros!

295
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,980
The strongest gladiator
in the history of the Colosseum!

296
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,030
That's the old man the statue is of!

297
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,740
Yes, that's him!

298
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,870
And he's also...

299
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,460
...Rebecca's biological father!

300
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,250
What?! She said she didn't know him!

301
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,020
When people forget about you,

302
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,470
there's nothing you can do
to make them remember you!

303
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,780
That's why he's just been watching over
his beloved daughter for a decade!

304
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:22,880
He has always been by her side,
day after day, as a toy soldier!

305
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,360
Hey, who the hell are you?!

306
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,890
You are...!

307
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,270
You're Kyros, aren't you?!

308
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,070
Yes, sir!

309
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,620
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
for a decade!

310
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,850
Now, I'm here to save you!

311
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,150
I'm here to take back the real Dressrosa!

312
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,590
Kyros takes down Doflamingo!

313
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,170
This sends unprecedented shock
waves throughout the Royal Palace

314
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,700
and at the same time, the fight
at the Colosseum is about to

315
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,560
reach its dramatic climax!

316
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,460
The battle for the Flare-Flare Fruit
finally comes to an end!

317
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,670
On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Fire Fist Strikes!

318
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,970
The Flare-Flare Fruit Power Returns!"

319
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
