2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,080
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,550
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,410
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,630
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,480
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,650
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,780
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,490
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,290
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,630
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,360
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,140
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,690
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,670
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,720
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,460
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,240
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,480
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,090
The Straw Hat crew landed
on the Sabaody Archipelago

51
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,150
to search for a ship coating craftsman
to help them reach Fish-Man Island.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,030
During the adventure, Camie, a mermaid
who was with them, was kidnapped.

53
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,830
After determining her location,

54
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,040
Nami and company attempted
to win her in an auction.

55
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,170
All the way from Fish-Man
Island, the mermaid Camie!

56
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,030
Camie!

57
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,900
They're selling Camie now!

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,550
Alright! We're gonna get her
back! We have 200 million here!

59
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,140
However, Nami's plan failed
in an unforeseen manner.

60
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,020
I'll buy it for 500 million Berries!

61
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,270
So suddenly?! We don't have that much!

62
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,280
We can't let this happen!

63
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,610
We can't let our friend get
bought and taken away like this!

64
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,780
Just then...

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,080
Luffy!

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Luffy-chin!

67
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,390
Camie! We've been looking
everywhere! What a relief!

68
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,870
Hold on, Straw Hat! What are you doing?!

69
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,630
Hachi tried to hold Luffy back as
he went to rescue Camie, but...

70
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,950
He's a fish-man!

71
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,050
Hachi was then gunned down
by a Celestial Dragon!

72
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,640
Don't... Don't be mad...

73
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,930
You promised not to defy
the Celestial Dragons,

74
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,110
even if you saw someone get shot...!

75
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,910
You lousy fish, still blabbering
on even though I shot you!

76
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,160
You annoy me!

77
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,320
What's with that look, you?!

78
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,080
You guys'll get in huge trouble too!

79
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,290
Straw Hat-ya...?

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,960
Is he serious?!

81
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,840
You annoy me, too!

82
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,580
"Major Panic! Desperate
Struggle at the Auction House"

83
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,460
S-Saint Charloss...

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,020
Ch-Charloss!

85
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,220
Sorry, guys.

86
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,620
Punching this guy means a navy admiral
is gonna come here with a warship...

87
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,250
I missed my chance to cut him down
because you beat him up first.

88
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,070
Hachi! Hang on!

89
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,920
You're all in big trouble now...!

90
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,050
We can't help it! That's just how Luffy is!

91
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,050
Alright, then...

92
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,520
Guess that makes it clear
what we gotta do now.

93
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,010
I think the key to Camie's collar
is probably somewhere backstage!

94
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,300
I need to tend to Hachi's
injury! You get the key!

95
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,240
Guys...!

96
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,060
Charloss...!

97
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,410
Brother Charloss! Not even
Father has ever struck you!

98
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,660
Curse you!

99
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,040
How dare you, a commoner,
lay a hand on my son!

100
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,080
Th-They've made the Celestial Dragons mad!

101
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
Run! Get outside!

102
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,880
Leave! Quick!

103
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,050
Quit pushing!

104
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,070
I'll teach you what happens
when you assault us,

105
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,520
the descendants of this world's Creators!

106
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,180
Hell if we care, you bastard!

107
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,270
How dare you strike Saint Roswald!

108
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,940
Joue!

109
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Concasser!

110
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,670
Go, Franky! Free Camie-chan!

111
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,780
Alright! Super leave it to me!

112
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,420
Guards! Get them! Seize the pirates!

113
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,790
They just keep coming!

114
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,020
What?!

115
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,220
What a ruckus. Sounds like
something's happened...

116
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,680
All out...

117
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,290
Well, then...

118
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,260
Old man...

119
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,230
Only a fool would protect a lousy fish!

120
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,400
Gum-Gum...

121
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,410
...Whip!

122
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,070
Gotcha!

123
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,080
Tatsu...

124
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,400
...Maki!

125
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,550
Strong Right!

126
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,180
...And Fresh Fire!

127
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,930
Outta the way, outta the way!

128
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,890
Such violence!

129
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,860
Curse you all...!

130
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,570
Halt!

131
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,530
Stay away!

132
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,420
Watch out for thunderclouds!

133
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,350
Thunderbolt Tempo!

134
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,340
So sorry!

135
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,230
Yeah!

136
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,620
You intend to defy us to
the very end, do you?!

137
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,880
Gum-Gum...

138
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,110
...Battle-Axe!

139
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,530
Camie isn't for sale!

140
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,760
Call for a navy admiral and a warship!

141
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,890
Let them see who's boss!

142
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,990
When are we gonna get there?!

143
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,020
Soon! We're in Grove #1 now!

144
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,250
Straw Hat, the busty girl, the
young master, the swordsman,

145
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,240
the panties guy, and the
reindeer have already arrived!

146
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,190
Huh? That means the only ones
who are late are Robin, Brook...

147
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,410
...and me?!

148
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh! How could this happen
to the great Usopp-sama?!

149
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,250
Hurry! Go!

150
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,920
Quit thrashing around! That's dangerous!

151
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,050
Come on! Faster!

152
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,170
Go!

153
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,260
Oh, what a beautiful sky!

154
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,350
Wait, huh?!

155
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,460
Whew, I owe you one...

156
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,170
You know better than to jump off early!

157
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,310
You're the one who shook me off!

158
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,120
You were going too fast. Bye.

159
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,770
We'll be going on ahead!

160
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,460
Wait for me, guys!

161
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,100
A pirate struck a Celestial Dragon!

162
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Navy Headquarters is going
to send a warship now!

163
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,050
"Justice"

164
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,470
I can't believe this! I should have
just paid for my slave and left!

165
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,230
Watch it, you!

166
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,690
It would be a waste to
use that to buy someone.

167
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,360
I think I'll use it in a
more productive way instead.

168
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,450
There's no end to 'em!

169
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,490
That's for sure! I'm gonna wear
down my heels at this rate!

170
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,990
Say your prayers!

171
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,870
Duck!

172
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,540
36 Pound Cannon!

173
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,080
Are you trying to kill us?!

174
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,550
I did warn you.

175
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,130
We couldn't hear you!

176
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,960
Camie!

177
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,180
Hatchin!

178
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,280
Are you okay?! They didn't do
anything bad to you, did they?!

179
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,490
I'm fine! But you've been hurt!

180
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,220
Don't worry! Who do you take me for?!

181
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,290
I'm Hachi, the takoyaki seller!

182
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,270
Just hang on a little
longer! Wait right there!

183
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,580
Yeah! Hatchin! Everyone!

184
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,330
Just like the rumors said...

185
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,590
Yeah. He's one crazy bastard.

186
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,090
Straw Hat-ya Luffy...

187
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,090
A 300 million Berry bounty, huh...

188
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,790
An uproar is already underway. There's
a flood of people at the entrance.

189
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,630
Our only choice is to jump into the
fray! Just crash into it, if you would!

190
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,820
Understood!

191
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,750
Huh?! I-I need to prepare myself first!

192
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,350
Here we go!

193
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,680
My "can't go to auction houses" disease...!

194
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,480
More flying fish!

195
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,740
Thank you!

196
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,560
Take care!

197
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,520
Cien Fleurs!

198
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,990
Wing!

199
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,230
Alright! Good luck!

200
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,200
Off I go!

201
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,360
Clutch!

202
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,230
I just cracked my back...!

203
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,380
Brook.

204
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,340
Oh, that's right! Milk heals
me since I'm nothing but bones!

205
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,060
I'm nothing but bones
and bones! Viva calcium!

206
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,750
Now, then! Pardon my late entrance!

207
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,020
Damn pirate!

208
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,680
Clutch!

209
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,320
Damn! Guard the mermaid at all costs!

210
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,650
500 million! She sold for 500 million!

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,990
Exterminate them at once!

212
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,690
Sorry to keep you waiting, folks!

213
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,710
There's nothing to fear now
that Usopp-sama is here!

214
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,790
The hero is always the
last to make an entrance!

215
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,750
I am the headliner here, after all!

216
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,630
S-So high up!

217
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,380
Since I'm here, maybe I'll
just fret for a little longer!

218
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,470
Get going already!

219
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,690
I actually would've preferred
to do it at my own pace!

220
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,500
I'll punish these cretins by
stuffing and preserving the women

221
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,900
and making the men slaves and starving them!

222
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,570
Father!

223
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,920
Oww, oww...!

224
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,990
Wait, that didn't hurt that much...

225
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,330
Sorry, mister!

226
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,820
S-Saint Roswald, too?!

227
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,750
You just repeated your crime, pirate!

228
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,050
Usopp! Robin! Brook!

229
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,720
Looks like everyone's here!

230
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,530
Luffy! Where's Camie?!

231
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,260
Over there! We'll run away as soon
as the bomb around her neck is off!

232
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,850
We have to hurry before the
warship and admiral get here!

233
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,190
Eh?!

234
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,610
The navy's already here, Straw Hat-ya.

235
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,780
Who're you?

236
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,730
What's with that bear?

237
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,620
They've had the place surrounded
before the auctions even began.

238
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,960
Navy Headquarters has a post
on this archipelago, you see.

239
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,050
Please leave the area immediately!
It's all right! We're here!

240
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,180
How's it look inside?!

241
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,360
We've finished evacuating the patrons!

242
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,500
The three Celestial Dragons are still inside!

243
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,140
Bring them out at once!

244
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,100
You damn pirates! Don't think
you'll get out of here unhurt!

245
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,560
I dunno who they wanted to catch,

246
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,530
but I doubt they expected anyone
would beat up the Celestial Dragons.

247
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,530
That was an interesting show
you gave, Straw Hat-ya crew.

248
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,100
You must be Trafalgar Law.

249
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,660
Luffy. He's a pirate.

250
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,920
Huh?! The bear, too?

251
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,630
And the man over there...

252
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,590
Eustass Captain Kid.

253
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,300
Eh?! That's the one with a
higher bounty than Luffy-san?!

254
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,820
This is unforgivable!

255
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,830
In which case, I'll kill this
mermaid that they're after!

256
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,790
The 500 million Berries!

257
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,990
P-P-Please wait, Saint Shalria!

258
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,370
That item hasn't been paid for yet!

259
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,620
Please wait, Saint Shalria! Saint Shalria!

260
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,560
Quiet, commoner!

261
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,550
All right, fish! This is
the end, once and for all!

262
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,550
Crap! Camie-chan's in trouble!

263
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,910
Quit your squirming!

264
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,100
Damn...!

265
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,230
Now you die!

266
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,690
Camie!

267
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,190
Oh no! We can't stop her in time!

268
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,070
S-Saint Shalria!

269
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,250
See, Mr. Giant?

270
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,620
The place is in a real uproar.
I'd say the auction's over.

271
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,470
I've stolen some money now,

272
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,690
so guess I'll head back
to the gambling houses...

273
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,860
You're one disagreeable old man.

274
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,320
You were only here to get some money?

275
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,210
I was hoping for a chance to steal
from whoever bought me too...

276
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,950
But I guess it wasn't meant to be.

277
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh, right. I'm all out.
First thing is more alcohol.

278
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,750
Think about it.

279
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,130
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't
want an old man like me for a slave.

280
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,850
Oh? Looks like we've
garnered some attention...

281
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,470
Who's that old man and that giant?!

282
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,250
Those are today's merchandise! How
did they get out of their cell?!

283
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,740
They don't have collars!
How did they unlock them?!

284
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,670
What do we do?

285
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,330
What do you mean? Catching people is
outside of our field of expertise!

286
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,460
We can't hold back an unshackled giant!

287
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,490
R-Rayleigh!

288
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,680
You mean Rayleigh, the coating craftsman?!

289
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,920
Which one is he?!

290
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,070
Oh! Is that you, Hachi?! It is!

291
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,410
It's good to see you again!
What are you doing here?!

292
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,930
How did you get that injury?!

293
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,310
No, that's okay, you needn't say a thing!

294
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,710
In short... I see. I understand
the situation now.

295
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,170
You sure got yourself into
a heap of trouble, Hachi.

296
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,060
And you folks saved him?

297
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,820
Well, then...

298
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,750
Is he...

299
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,670
It couldn't be!

300
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,880
Huh?! How?! What did you just do?!

301
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,050
Who is this old guy?!

302
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,860
That straw hat suits dauntless men very well.

303
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,570
I've been wanting to meet you...

304
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,310
...Monkey D. Luffy.

305
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,380
That brat again?

306
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,790
He's always causing problems,
one after another!

307
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:31,180
Given that World Nobles are the victims
here, we will need to take action, Sengoku-san.

308
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,090
Kizaru...

309
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,790
Allow me to go.

310
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,770
Rest easy.

311
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,560
"Admiral Kizaru Takes Action!
Sabaody Archipelago Thrown into Chaos"

313
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,490
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
