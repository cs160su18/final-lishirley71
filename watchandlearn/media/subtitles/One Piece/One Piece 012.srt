00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,640
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,080
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,560
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,800
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:25,220
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,860
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,200
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,450
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,890
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,670
No!

25
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
It's not a lie!

26
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,840
Pirates really are going
to come, aren't they?

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,360
Yeah. They're definitely gonna show up.

28
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,120
But everyone thinks it's a lie!

29
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,370
I love this village!
I want to protect everyone!

30
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,560
Alright! We'll help you out!

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,800
These are Klahadore's
pirates we're dealing with!

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,380
Of course I'm scared!
What's wrong with that?!

33
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,580
We ain't laughing!

34
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,860
As if we'd risk our lives
because of sympathy!

35
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:48,040
"Clash with the Black Cat Pirates!
Great Battle on the Slope!"

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,160
Alright. They're going to attack
from this shore at daybreak.

37
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,520
But the only route into
the village is this one slope.

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,320
Everything else is cliff,
making it tougher to come through.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,650
In other words, if we can
defend this slope to the death,

40
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,170
the village won't get attacked!

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,430
Oh! That's easy!

42
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,550
Talking about it is, but the
rest depends on our strength!

43
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,300
What can you guys do?

44
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,070
Cut.

45
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,100
Stretch.

46
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,190
Steal.

47
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,180
I can hide.

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,010
You're gonna fight!

49
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm just kidding! Geez!

50
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,210
Oh, Klahadore-san! Welcome back!

51
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,400
How is she?

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,980
She's resting now.

53
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,110
She seemed quite exhausted...

54
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,570
But to think such a thing happened
while I was at the next town over...

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,460
That Usopp lad certainly
knows how to cause trouble.

56
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,560
Yes...

57
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,310
And of all things,
he claimed you were a pirate...

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,230
Such a transparent lie!

59
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,230
Indeed.

60
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,620
What is this?

61
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,120
Oh, that seems to be a
present from her to you.

62
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,720
It's your third year at this mansion,

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,990
so it's a sort of commemoration.

64
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,540
Commemoration...

65
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,000
Your current glasses seem to slip often,

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,670
so she custom-ordered those!

67
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,780
She's such a nice, thoughtful person!

68
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,210
A commemoration?

69
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,540
Indeed, tomorrow is a
day to commemorate.

70
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,190
Eh?

71
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,270
It's a crescent moon tonight.

72
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,900
Huh?

73
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,500
Nights like this make my heart race,

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,380
and my blood stir...

75
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,310
K-Klahadore-san!

76
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,750
What are you doing to her present?!

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,580
Oh, I'll be accepting a present, all right.

78
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,890
But it won't be this--
it'll be this entire mansion!

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,320
W-What are you saying?!

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,190
There is no more need
to continue the act.

81
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,150
An accident is going to occur
in a few hours, anyway...

82
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,740
It's truly been three long years!

83
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,650
Miss! Run away!

84
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,930
Captain Jango!

85
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,810
It's almost daybreak!
Please wake up, Captain Jango!

86
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,460
Good morning, Captain!

87
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,230
Good morning!

88
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,150
You idiots!

89
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,860
My policy is to say "good morning"
with the morning sun!

90
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,270
He seems to be in a bad mood.

91
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,700
He did just wake up...

92
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,460
Just look! The moon's still up,
and it's the middle of the night!

93
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,230
How dare you shout loudly!

94
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,540
Our apologies, sir! We're sorry, sir!

95
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,700
Alright, then.

96
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,670
Good morning, fellows!

97
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,820
Good morning? That's the
opposite of what he just said!

98
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,150
You idiot! He's in a better
mood now, that's all!

99
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh!

100
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,440
Quit bein' confusing!

101
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,530
Men!

102
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,200
Set sail!

103
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,320
Alright! Perfect!

104
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,370
Now they won't be able
to climb up this slope,

105
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,800
thanks to all this oil
we've laid out here!

106
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,320
We'll let 'em slip and
slide on this slope,

107
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,140
then beat the crap out of
'em while they flail about!

108
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,020
Oil, huh?

109
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,530
No matter what,
we will protect this slope!

110
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,350
Conversely, let's just hope
that none of us slip down there.

111
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
It'd be like diving right
into an ant-lion pit.

112
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,750
I'm amazed you can
think up stuff this cheeky!

113
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,570
But of course!

114
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,710
When it comes to
cheekiness and slingshots,

115
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,540
I'm utterly confident!

116
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,670
It's almost daybreak.

117
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,430
They'll be coming.

118
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,350
We're here!

119
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,930
Alright, men! Go ashore!

120
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,060
Trash the village
and head for the mansion!

121
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,810
Captain! There are
two strange boats here!

122
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,120
What?!

123
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,610
Shall I check them out?

124
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,410
Leave 'em. They're not treasure ships.

125
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,850
Don't screw up our schedule!

126
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,020
Understood!

127
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,420
Get going, you guys!

128
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,190
Where are they?

129
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,390
The sky's all bright now.
What's the deal?

130
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,600
Maybe they overslept or somethin'?

131
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,990
No.

132
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,200
They'll definitely show up. Lot's of 'em.

133
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,460
Say...

134
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,870
Maybe it's just my imagination,

135
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,700
but I hear, "Yaaah!"
coming from somewhere...

136
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,750
Yeah, I definitely hear it!

137
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,220
N-Now that you mention it...

138
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,370
What?! What is it?!

139
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,990
There's a place just like
this to the north, too!

140
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,360
You don't suppose...

141
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,860
You mean this is the wrong shore?!

142
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,670
This is where they had
their secret meeting,

143
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,840
so I just assumed...

144
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,300
Hey! Let's hurry!

145
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,520
They're gonna get into the
village! Where is this place?!

146
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,610
If you run straight north from here,
you'll get there in three minutes!

147
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,150
The terrain there is
almost exactly the same,

148
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,280
so we just need to
stop them at the slope!

149
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,230
Don't worry! We'll do it somehow!

150
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,800
Oh, no!

151
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,120
The north shore is where our boats are!

152
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,430
They're gonna take the treasure!

153
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,930
I'll be there in 20 seconds!

154
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,020
Dammit! My brilliant Oil
Strategy was all for nothing!

155
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,750
My treasure...

156
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,540
Hey!

157
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,340
What're you doing?! Let's go!

158
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,870
Y-Yeah! We have to hurry--

159
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,950
Help! I'm falling!

160
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,400
Let go, you moron!

161
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,920
Sorry!

162
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,340
Perfect!

163
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,790
Thanks, Zoro!

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,250
Sorry! The treasure's in danger!

165
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,470
Try to get back up somehow!

166
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,140
That girl's gonna pay!

167
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,390
I refuse to let them enter the village!

168
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,660
But Luffy sure runs fast!

169
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,600
I can't even see him anymore!

170
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,750
Straight north!
Straight north! Straight north!

171
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,560
They're in big trouble
if they touch my treasure!

172
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,830
There's someone at the top of the hill!

173
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,170
You!

174
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,980
My name is Captain Usopp!

175
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,230
I've been waiting for you all this time!

176
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,760
I-I'm completely ready to fight!

177
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,030
Turn back now, if you don't wanna die!

178
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,840
W-What the--? I'm the first one here?!

179
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,830
But he was running way ahead of me!

180
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,970
Dammit!

181
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,320
What do I do?! I can't climb up!

182
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,300
I'm in the village now! That's weird!

183
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,240
He said north, so I ran
in a cold-ish direction!

184
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,320
You're that boy who
overheard our plan.

185
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,510
What do you think you're doing?

186
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,770
I-I'm warning you!
Turn back now while you still can!

187
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,560
Or else my 100 million crewmen will...

188
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,880
...beat the crap out of you guys!

189
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,330
100 million?

190
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,490
Hey, now! That's even
worse than a kid's lie!

191
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,740
What?! 100 million?! Wow!

192
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,710
He's obviously lying, Captain!

193
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,160
He's so naïve...

194
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,670
Yikes! They saw through it?!

195
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,850
He seriously thought
he could fool us, too...

196
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,330
How dare you trick me!

197
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,090
Captain Jango! Shocking news!

198
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,350
Really?! That's bad!

199
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,410
No! It's not bad!

200
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,200
We found treasure
in those weird boats!

201
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,130
An incredible amount!
Maybe 4, no, 5 million Berries!

202
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:18,790
What?!

203
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,920
F-Five million Berries?!

204
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,290
Why is there that much
money in those guys' boats?

205
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,130
That's my treasure!

206
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,850
But you can have it!

207
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,980
What?! You'll give us the treasure?!

208
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,760
That's right!

209
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,950
In exchange for that treasure,
I ask that you turn back now!

210
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,420
Wha--?! You think you can
buy us off with money?!

211
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,880
What a disgraceful guy!

212
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,950
You fool. We're pirates, you know.

213
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,760
We're obviously going
to take this treasure!

214
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,760
It's not good enough of
a reason for us to turn back.

215
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,220
Y-You have a point...

216
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,490
Alright, then! On "one, two,
Jango," you'll let us by!

217
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,720
It's that weapon from before!

218
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,450
One! Two!

219
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,230
Jan--

220
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,870
Quit saying stupid crap!

221
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,770
Oww!

222
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,690
W-Who's she?!

223
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,290
Captain! This is no time to
hypnotize yourself and let people by!

224
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,300
That boat's treasure is mine!
I won't let you have a single Berry!

225
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,470
Hold on to it!
I'll come take it back now!

226
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,170
That hurt!

227
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,720
Who said you could
give them my treasure?!

228
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,920
What's wrong with just
saying they can have it?!

229
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,010
What're you talking about?!
After I just saved you!

230
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,290
Huh?

231
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,650
I forgot to mention it,

232
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,970
but don't watch his ring
all the way through!

233
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,470
He's a hypnotist!

234
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,010
H-Hypnosis?!

235
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,460
So? Where's Luffy?
He ran here first, right?

236
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,380
Dunno! He either
chickened out or got lost!

237
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,170
He got lost, then.

238
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,940
Geez! Just when we need him, too!

239
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,010
I'll take command here.
Go kick their butts! I'll cover you!

240
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,550
Eh?! Hold on, why me?!

241
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,250
There's no way I can take on that
huge army! I'm weak, you know!

242
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,220
Don't underestimate me
just 'cause I'm a guy!

243
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,830
I'm so scared my legs are
shaking like crazy! See?!

244
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,520
Big deal!

245
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,530
See, look! I'm so scared
I have tears in my eyes!

246
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,530
Your eyes are bone dry!

247
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,500
If you're gonna lie,
lie more realistically!

248
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,600
I don't need you to tell me that!

249
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,080
We don't have time to mess with them.

250
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,400
Crush 'em and head
for the village, men!

251
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,300
H-Here they come!

252
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,370
Oh, yeah! I have caltrops!

253
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,980
Oh! You do have some good stuff!

254
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,930
Gimme, gimme!

255
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,760
Take this!

256
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,840
Caltrop Hell!

257
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,360
Damn that Nami!
She's gonna pay for this!

258
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,480
I made it!

259
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,030
W-Which way is the north shore?!

260
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,400
Straight north!
Straight north! Straight north!

261
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,350
Which way is north?!

262
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,930
Oww!

263
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,080
Yes! We got 'em!

264
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,760
Now! Special Attack: Lead Star!

265
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,850
Bastard!

266
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,990
Way to go! Keep it up, now!

267
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,990
I'm gonna quit fighting for a bit.

268
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,310
You haven't even fought yet!

269
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,400
What is it?!

270
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,100
There are caltrops behind us too...

271
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,880
You moron! You dropped 'em there!

272
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,740
Outta the damn way!

273
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,060
Do you seriously think you can stop us?

274
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,650
Let's go, guys! Captain Kuro is waiting!

275
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,820
W-What the--?!

276
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,780
Let go, you bastard! Let the hell go!

277
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,130
Damn you! Take this! Take this!

278
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,730
I... can't...

279
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,100
...let you get past this slope...

280
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,820
Because I only lied, like I always do...

281
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,380
So the village is going to have
just another ordinary day...

282
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,510
So I absolutely won't let you pass!

283
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,060
Damn kid! Shut up!

284
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,860
Damn girl!

285
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,470
Oww!

286
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,330
Are you--?!

287
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,030
That's enough now!

288
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,100
Hey, you guys!

289
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,680
Quit bothering with them
and get going already!

290
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,320
Have you forgotten that
this is Captain Kuro's plan?!

291
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,300
If anything happens
to throw his plan off,

292
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,420
he'll kill every one of us!

293
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,220
Do you understand that,
you dumbasses?!

294
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,410
H-Hey, now...

295
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,260
Yeah, hurry to the village!

296
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,460
S-Stop...

297
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,670
Dammit...

298
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,840
Stop!

299
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,570
Stop... Don't go to the village!

300
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,560
Shut up!

301
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,100
Stop! Please!
Please don't kill everyone!

302
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,920
I love this village! I want to protect it!

303
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,940
W-What is this, Captain Jango?!

304
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,480
Nobody mentioned guys
like them were in the village!

305
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,930
About time...

306
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,090
What were those
unchallenging guys just now?!

307
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,690
Don't look at me!
I'm not satisfied, though!

308
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,110
Nami! How dare you
kick me down there!

309
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,740
Usopp, you jerk!

310
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,580
You didn't say which way was north!

311
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,870
Who're they?

312
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,230
They're late...

313
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,420
They all know full well what happens...

314
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,730
...to those who upset my plans...

315
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,520
They think they can
take their sweet time...

316
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,440
If they've already forgotten that fact...

317
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,170
...then I'll slaughter them all!

318
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,980
It is Klahadore from the mansion!

319
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,030
Why is he walking toward the shore,

320
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,830
this early in the morning?!

321
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

322
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

323
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

324
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

325
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

326
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

327
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,870
so that my memories won't fade

328
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,510
Is this the place?!

329
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,780
Damn you, Nami!

330
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,440
How dare you leave me down there?!

331
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,850
Crap! Zoro's really mad!

332
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,120
Get ready to pay, Nami!

333
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,550
I know! Get sleepy at the
count of "one, two, Jango"!

334
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,250
You wish!

335
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,450
Hey, Luffy! Quit sleeping, you!

336
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,870
Look at that guy's hand!

337
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,990
Don't avoid the issue!

338
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

339
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,400
"The Terrifying Duo!
Meowban Brothers vs. Zoro"

340
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,330
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
