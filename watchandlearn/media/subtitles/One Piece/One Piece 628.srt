00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,500
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,560
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the
world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure? If you want
it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,880
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,550
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,520

Daybreak hasn't come
yet and I can't wait

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,200

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,880
It's important not to wake up

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,510
we go!

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are  after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World, the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has  ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,970
The New World has ruined many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,470
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,  a boy whose body turned

74
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,750
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,690
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,190
While the Straw Hats were
on their way to Dressrosa,

78
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,760
a mysterious man named Breed, who
leads a pack of sea monsters,

79
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
made a raid on them
and kidnapped Caesar.

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,430
Luffy and two others snuck into the
enemy's ship to take back Caesar

81
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,000
and were reunited with a Kung Fu
Dugong who they met in Alabasta

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,810
but like the Dugong and
the other monsters,

83
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,880
they've been taken control of by
Breed's Peto-Peto Fruit power.

84
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,650
Kill those two, Dugong!

85
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,660
"A Major Turnaround! Luffy's
Angry Iron Fist Strikes!"

86
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,890
That was quite a punch, Kung Fu Dugong!

87
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,490
How do you feel now?

88
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,940
You sent some shitty humans
to hell with your own hands.

89
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,600
Lie down!

90
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,010
Now I have to discipline you
because you disappointed me!

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,390
Stop!

92
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,180
Oh, Chappy!

93
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,120
What's wrong?!

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,920
You must forget about Straw Hat!

95
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,280
You will live in a kingdom that I

96
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,260
will create as my loyal pet
for the rest of your life!

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,510
What do you think you're doing?

98
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm a pirate!

99
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,370
Pirates should be free!

100
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm not gonna become your
pet even if it means death!

101
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,530
Pirates are free.

102
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,270
Are you gonna betray me?!

103
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,200
Betray you?! Luffy is my only captain!

104
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,740
Are you stupid?!

105
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,510
Straw Hat has been swallowed by
the sea along with Trafalgar!

106
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,350
You know what happens to

107
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,520
Devil Fruit eaters when
they fall into water...

108
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,780
He'll never be defeated
by a guy like you!

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,050
He's gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

110
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,290
The King of the Pirates?!

111
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,390
Are you out of your mind?!

112
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,800
You are out of your mind!

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,730
You say you're gonna create a
kingdom of submissive animals?!

114
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,140
There's not a chance for
you to create such a thing!

115
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,770
You never try to understand
the people around you!

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,540
No one's gonna follow someone like you!

117
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,920
You never try to understand
the people around you!

118
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,720
No one's gonna follow someone like you!

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,260
Shut up!

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,110
I'll leave the rest up to you guys!

121
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,950
Hey, didn't you hear me?!

122
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,550
I mean "You all have
to finish them off"!

123
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,090
What? Maybe, the Peto-Peto Fruit is...

124
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,160
Now,

125
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,790
do it!

126
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,410
What's going on?!

127
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,130
What?!

128
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,980
Excuse us for a while, you guys.

129
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,050
Luffy!

130
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,660
I'm here to get Chopper back!

131
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,950
And, to give you a good, solid punch!

132
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
Why are you here?!

133
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,760
You two got thrown into the sea!

134
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,730
Your little power won't
work against us anymore.

135
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,030
Huh? What are you talking about?!

136
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,340
Trafalgar! Straw Hat! Sit down!

137
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,600
Hey! I said "Sit down"!

138
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,530
Don't you hear me?!

139
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,780
I thought so.

140
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,110
If we can't hear your command, your
special power won't affect us.

141
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,250
Am I right?

142
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,960
I can't hear your orders like
this. I can shut out your voice.

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,250
You have Transponder Snails
and loudspeakers everywhere

144
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,730
so you can give the animals
commands all at once, don't you?

145
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,300
When did you figure it out?!

146
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,200
It went through my mind at that time.

147
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,230
Caesar!

148
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
Lie down!

149
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,370
Hey, Caesar!

150
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,170
I said "Lie down"! Can't you hear me?!

151
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,520
After I figured it out,

152
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,670
I pretended that I was
being controlled by you

153
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,690
and looked for a chance
to take Caesar back.

154
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,380
Even the fight against Straw Hat, you...

155
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,960
Yes, I was pretending that I
was being controlled by you.

156
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,400
He, however,

157
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,400
was really being puppeteered.

158
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,530
Did you say something?

159
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,710
I can't hear what you're
saying with these earplugs.

160
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,150
It wasn't too hard for me to break

161
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,780
our fall because I could
use my Devil Fruit power.

162
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,070
I gotta get away while that jerk
is focusing on Straw Hat and Law.

163
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,390
Is that Straw Hat's submersible?!

164
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,800
How lucky I am!

165
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,970
Oh, Caesar!

166
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,110
We were lucky to catch
Caesar right away.

167
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,180
I wasn't lucky at all! It
couldn't have been worse!

168
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,060
Huh? What did you say?!

169
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,950
If you wanna join the conversation,
take out your earplugs!

170
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,080
--What did you say?!
--I said "Take out your earplugs"!

171
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,290
I said...

172
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,860
Pets are useless!

173
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,810
Humans are worthless!

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,100
Everyone is a piece of trash!

175
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,280
Earplugs?! What a stupid gimmick!

176
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,260
Do you think you're outsmarting me?!

177
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,080
Let me show you the true, formidable
power of the Peto-Peto Fruit!

178
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,250
What?

179
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,290
Now, "me"!

180
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,290
Kill all those...

181
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,730
...stinking humans!

182
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,220
What is he doing? He put
a collar on himself!

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,130
He is...

184
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,070
No way!

185
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,940
That's right!

186
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,910
Once you have been given an order
through the Peto-Peto power,

187
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:53,790
it will bring forth all of your power
even that is normally impossible!

188
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,180
Fall in, my damned pets!

189
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,400
Wh-What's going on?!

190
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,800
Now, guys,

191
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,200
those lousy humans are
not following my orders!

192
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,610
Kill them!

193
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,680
Stop!

194
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,280
How could you do that to your own crew?!

195
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,050
Seal?

196
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,920
What do you want?!

197
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,820
"We are not your tools!"

198
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,580
That's what the Dugong said!

199
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,590
"We might be your crew but
we won't be your tools!"

200
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,960
"We are no longer your pets!"

201
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,280
"We're not gonna give in
to your power! We're...

202
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,880
...pirates!"

203
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,470
You bastards!

204
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,800
What do you think you're doing?!

205
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,880
Seal!

206
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,070
Let's knock him on his ass!

207
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,100
Damn!

208
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,100
How dare you all go against me?!

209
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,440
Fine! I'll destroy everything!

210
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,910
Come on, Sea Lapins!

211
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,100
How do you like my overwhelming power?!

212
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,470
I'll let you all be
swallowed by the sea!

213
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,020
There's nothing you can do!

214
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,290
Let's do it, Seal!

215
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,100
Those of you who disobey
me are all worthless!

216
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,170
All of you deserve death!

217
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,270
Straight to hell with you all...

218
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,340
What's wrong with you
guys?! Hey! Let go of me!

219
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,840
Hey! Let go of me!

220
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,310
Hey!

221
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,640
Gum-Gum...

222
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,390
...Fore-fist...

223
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,560
...Punch!

224
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,750
Hey!

225
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,670
What's that?

226
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,620
What's wrong?

227
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,520
No, I mean, look.

228
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,350
Hey!

229
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,130
Luffy and Chopper and... a dugong and...

230
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,060
...rabbits?!

231
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,170
He said if we keep going straight,
we'll get to Dressrosa in no time.

232
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,040
Thank you for carrying the Sunny!

233
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,680
Thank you!

234
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,080
What are you all gonna do now?

235
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,690
Are you gonna go back to Alabasta?

236
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,710
"It's too early to go home," he said.

237
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,400
"We're Sea Monster Pirates!"

238
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,870
"We're gonna explore the New World,
chasing dreams and adventures!"

239
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,740
Sounds good!

240
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,120
"Everybody! Thank you for everything!"

241
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,140
Take care, Seal!

242
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,790
He said "All right,
everybody, time to go."

243
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,340
See you!

244
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,810
Take care!

245
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,180
Don't catch a cold!

246
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,320
See you again!

247
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,730
The morning paper!

248
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,360
"Don Quixote Doflamingo..."

249
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,430
"...Withdraws from..."

250
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,200
"...the Seven Warlords"!

251
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,050
"And abdicates the throne of
Dressrosa"?! What the hell?!

252
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,210
"Throne" means he was a king?!

253
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,520
A king?!

254
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,370
Then it must be a birds' kingdom!

255
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,520
When things go this well,
it's kind of scary.

256
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,730
It's good. He had no choice.

257
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,210
By the way, why are our
faces here as well?

258
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,180
"The Warlord - Trafalgar Law..."

259
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,410
"Forms an unusual alliance
with the Straw Hats"?

260
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,180
"It is still unknown what the
Government will do to Law." It says!

261
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,780
What the hell?!

262
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,380
There's something else!

263
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,010
VARIOUS PLACES IN THE WORLD

264
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,450
There's so much going
on in today's paper!

265
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,090
Doflamingo quits the Warlords and
Law and Straw Hat join forces!

266
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,030
And these guys, too!

267
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,530
Captain Kid!

268
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,370
Scratchmen Apoo!

269
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,070
Basil Hawkins!

270
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,320
The Kid Pirates, the On Air Pirates,

271
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,010
and the Hawkins Pirates have
formed a pirate alliance, too?!

272
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,930
They were the troublemakers

273
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,040
that everyone kept an eye
on for last two years

274
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,180
and now they've joined
forces all at once!

275
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,290
Is something about to
happen in the New World?!

276
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,460
I can't believe other pirates
were forming an alliance, too!

277
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,320
They formed an alliance, too, huh?

278
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,970
I wonder if they're thinking
the same thing as us.

279
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,900
Forget about them.

280
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,790
We're gonna go on with the plan.

281
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,370
Focus on Doflamingo for now.

282
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,670
Now you know how important yesterday's
negotiation was for him.

283
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,020
All we did was kidnap Caesar.

284
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,200
In contrast, seemingly
overnight, he gave up

285
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,430
his throne which he's had for ten years

286
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,830
and the carte blanche given to him
as a privilege of being a Warlord.

287
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,940
He did it just to get this
guy back and that says a lot!

288
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,070
Your Majesty!

289
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,780
Your Majesty! Why did you resign?!

290
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,050
Please give us a reason, Your Majesty!

291
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,230
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

292
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,480
Your Majesty!

293
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,900
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

294
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,240
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

295
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,160
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

296
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,450
Ring, ring, ring...

297
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,420
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

298
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,950
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

299
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,670
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

300
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,060
Ring, ring, ring...

301
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,320
Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

302
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,460
It's me.

303
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,040
I resigned...

304
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,110
...from the Warlords.
