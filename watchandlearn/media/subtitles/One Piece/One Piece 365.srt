2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,960
Look over there!
Didn't Curly Cook come out with him?

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,940
Damn it!

49
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,400
Nami-san...

50
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,620
Wait!

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,950
Moria!

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,750
Are you going to chase
after me no matter what?

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,290
I'm worried about that huge zombie,

54
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,800
but taking you down is the only way
to recover everyone's shadows.

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,800
I won't let you escape!

56
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,180
Look! I am the last one laughing!

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,140
She sure is sound asleep.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,650
Let's go elsewhere... and hold
the ceremony... one more time,

59
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,320
my quiet bride!

60
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,910
Oh, crap!

61
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,040
Usopp!

62
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,620
Chopper! Robin!

63
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,920
W-W-We've got a problem!

64
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:44,220
O-O-Our wanted posters are
a-attached to Zombie Luffy's arm!

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,230
I-I'm sure of it!

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,110
He is totally...

67
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,040
...coming after us!

68
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:19,750
Come out, Straw Hat Crew!

69
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,550
Darn it, Luffy! Are you going
to crush your own crew?

70
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,040
Someone must have issued the order.

71
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,100
I hope the real Luffy is all right.

72
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,220
What is that?!

73
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,690
Can we take that monster down?

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,870
"Luffy Is the Enemy! The Ultimate Zombie
vs. the Straw Hat Crew!"

75
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,600
Wh-Wh-What is that? Its face freaks me out.

76
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,100
It's literally a monster.

77
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,810
Aren't they...?

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,530
Hey, Usopp! That you down there?

79
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,030
What was that? I thought I
heard someone say my name...

80
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,870
Z-Zoro! Why are you on the roof?

81
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,540
Franky! And Brook's okay, too.

82
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,080
At any rate, it looks like we can
check the skeleton off our list.

83
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,960
But it's too soon to check Nami-chan off.

84
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,190
Hey, move your butt!

85
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,480
Why in the world are you
getting in our way, Luffy?

86
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,750
Luffy...?

87
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,840
He is my enemy.

88
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,470
My name is Oars.

89
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,350
Nice to meet ya!

90
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,860
Stuff it! What's "nice" about this?

91
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,880
Sheesh! That is such a
birdbrained thing to say.

92
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,700
You sound just like Luffy.

93
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,330
He's trying to pick a
fight with that monster.

94
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,290
Did that moronic cook manage to save Nami?

95
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,050
He's in hotter water than the girlie!

96
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,640
C-C-Crap! This looks really bad!

97
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,720
Sanji's in trouble!

98
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,310
This was unexpected.

99
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,460
I had assumed they were only
interested in our shadows.

100
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,940
I wonder if we got a little carried away.

101
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,690
It's like all they care
about now is Luffy's shadow.

102
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,280
Scary! I'm scared! I
can't fight that monster!

103
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
It looks like I should lend him a hand.

104
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,580
Wait, wait, wait!

105
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,540
W-We should leave this to Sanji
so we don't trip him up.

106
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,380
Don't worry. He should be able
to escape without too much effort.

107
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,620
But won't that giant recognize him
from the wanted poster?

108
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,300
I doubt the beast will
simply let him walk away.

109
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,930
You've got a lot to learn, Robin-kun!
That's just the thing.

110
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,900
Do you think he'll recognize Sanji based off

111
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,600
the composite sketch on the wanted poster?

112
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,440
You're right! Sanji doesn't look anything
like the picture on his wanted poster.

113
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,270
--Bingo!
--I see. You have a good point.

114
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,950
Oh, you look just like the
picture on the wanted poster.

115
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,660
What?!

116
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,500
What looks the same?!

117
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,960
"What," huh? Your whole face.

118
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,920
No, it doesn't, stupid!

119
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,590
At any rate, aren't you one of the pirates?

120
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,760
So what if I am?!

121
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,220
I'm gonna crush you.

122
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,590
Huh?

123
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,950
Shoot! Shoot!

124
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,930
Sanji!

125
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,570
What was that, you bastard?

126
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,620
Wait, Moria!

127
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,540
Jerk!

128
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,590
Drat! That shadow got in the way again!

129
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,380
You never learn.

130
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,570
Oops! This is a dead end.

131
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,060
I've finally got you cornered!
Say your prayers, Giant Shallot!

132
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,180
Shouldn't you be the one saying your prayers?

133
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,190
While you're wasting time with me,

134
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:35,040
your combat skills are being used
to wipe out your crew, Straw Hat.

135
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,610
Shut up! My crew won't go down that easily.

136
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,910
Is that right? Then I'd better make
a break for it before you do me in!

137
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,210
Brick Bat!

138
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,210
Whoa! Crap!

139
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,590
Bye!

140
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,920
Gum-Gum Gatling!

141
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,060
Wait! I won't let you escape!

142
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,150
Moria-sama, we've got trouble!

143
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,990
What happened here?

144
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,750
Moria-sama, where did you go?

145
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,090
Wh-What are they doing?

146
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,340
You're being obnoxious,
you poor excuse for a penguin!

147
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,220
Shut up, stinky old man!

148
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,640
Guys! This is no time for
arguing amongst ourselves.

149
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,600
Who gave you permission to bicker?

150
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,020
We're following Hogback-sama's orders!

151
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,570
Beat it, you lousy bat!

152
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,870
That's absurd!

153
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,150
Hogback-sama would never order
you to do something like this.

154
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,700
What exactly did he say?

155
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,200
"Take out the pests!"

156
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,120
You pest!

157
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,370
--Take out the pest!
--You're the pest!

158
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,080
--They're a lost cause...
--You are such a pest!

159
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,270
Damn! That still hurts.

160
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,540
That jerk tried to make a fool of me!

161
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,360
But I'm not about to pass out.

162
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,830
I can't collapse until this
event of a lifetime is over!

163
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,910
Now then, let's resume the
wedding ceremony. Kiss the bride.

164
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,460
I'll finally get to kiss her this time!

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,670
That's Absalom-sama!

166
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,210
I know! Absalom-sama might
know where Moria-sama went.

167
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,180
--Here I go!
--Absalom-sama!

168
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,020
Wh-What was that for, you perverted beast?!

169
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,060
He insulted him! He slammed
him with an insult!

170
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,980
Crap! Now we're in for a storm!

171
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,680
Hildon, what are you doing here?

172
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,780
So? What did you want?

173
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,200
Huh?

174
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,530
He's surprisingly calm.

175
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,500
You see, I'm trying to find Moria-sama.

176
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,460
Can't you see for yourself? He isn't here!

177
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,150
So it would seem.

178
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,550
Sorry, but could you get
someone else to help you?

179
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,010
I'm busy at the moment.

180
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,140
Sorry for the intrusion. Goodbye!

181
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,050
Wait a second, Hildon.

182
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,060
Yes, what is it?

183
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,520
How dare you call me a "perverted beast"?!

184
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,060
That was mean.

185
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,860
It took that long to sink in?!

186
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,500
Wait, Giant Shallot!

187
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,670
Huh? Who's there?

188
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,340
Darn it! It's that stupid shadow!

189
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,890
Just you wait, Moria!

190
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,280
Man, he really let me have it.

191
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,850
I finally found him!

192
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,560
Moria-sama!

193
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,220
Moria-sama, I have news that
I'd like to report right away!

194
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,450
Hildon? What is it?

195
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,200
To be honest, it would appear the ship
is moving in an unfortunate direction.

196
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,790
We'll run into trouble if it
continues on its current course!

197
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,670
Is that right? If that's the case,
do something about it.

198
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,710
I'm busy at the moment.

199
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,000
--Later!
--B-But...!

200
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,970
You're in the way! Move it! Move!

201
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,740
Darn twerp's quickly darting every which way!

202
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,080
Sanji!

203
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,180
Sanji!

204
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,390
I swear, all that did was make a dust cloud!

205
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,320
Now it's my turn, you bastard!

206
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,230
Sanji!

207
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,760
Are you okay?

208
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,370
You won't get away this time.

209
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,250
Gum-Gum...

210
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,620
It's one of Luffy's moves!

211
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,040
Can he extend his arms?!

212
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,460
Is he a rubber man now?

213
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,510
...Sickle!

214
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,180
H-His arm didn't extend!

215
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,300
But with power and reach
like that, who cares?!

216
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,270
So that freakishly huge
body isn't just for show.

217
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,460
Just one direct hit could
do some serious damage!

218
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,690
Oars... I've heard that
name somewhere before.

219
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,570
Could he be the legendary Continent Puller
from ancient times, the Devil Oars?!

220
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,460
That'd explain it. It sounds like
Luffy's zombie isn't a pushover.

221
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,170
Collier Frit!

222
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,650
Sanji!

223
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,650
He's stinking fast for a behemoth!

224
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,950
I've got ya, puny pirate!

225
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,950
Crap! He's gonna get killed!

226
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,000
Sanji!

227
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,220
What is that monster gonna do?

228
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,320
Hey, stop it!

229
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,640
Sanji!

230
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,060
Die, puny pirate!

231
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,440
Fire Bird Star!

232
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
This is hot.

233
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,150
I... I... I'm sorry!

234
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,880
Sanji!

235
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,140
There is the black-haired woman
and the reindeer eating cotton candy.

236
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,810
He's headed our way!

237
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,030
Crap! Franky, lure him over here!

238
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,860
Now we're talking!

239
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,390
Eat this, monster!

240
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
Look out!

241
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,750
Get off the roof, you two!

242
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,910
One Gorilla!

243
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,530
Two Gorilla!

244
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,220
Three-Sword Style...

245
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,760
...Two Gorilla Slash!

246
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,270
Gum-Gum...

247
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,400
...Volcano!

248
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,900
Zoro, are you still alive?

249
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,610
No, he's dead if he falls from up there!

250
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,490
Yes!

251
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,240
Chew on this, monster!

252
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,160
Weapons Left!

253
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,460
He's so nimble! He dodged again!

254
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
What's he up to this time?

255
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,360
Franky! Brook!

256
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,900
Zoro's coming down!

257
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,370
Shoot! He'll die if he hits the ground!

258
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,450
Cien Fleurs! Spider Net!

259
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,090
I survived? Damn it...!

260
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,510
Eat this! You're still a zombie!

261
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,100
Special Attack! Salt Star!

262
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,020
How do you like that?

263
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,200
I-It wasn't enough!

264
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,200
Not for his massive body!

265
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,290
Heavy Gong!

266
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,910
D-Damn it, Luffy!

267
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,990
I don't know any of you losers!

268
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,790
I am Moria-sama's servant, Oars!

269
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,380
Ab-sama! Forget that woman and pucker up!

270
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,970
Learn when to quit! I won't kiss you!

271
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,800
--Then marry me!
--That isn't happening!

272
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,260
--Then kiss me!
--Are you even listening?

273
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,880
You just don't get it.

274
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,390
No, you don't!

275
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,980
Oh, shit! You made her wake up!

276
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

277
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,820
"You're Going Down, Absalom!!
Nami's Lightning Attack of Friendship!!"

278
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,790
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
