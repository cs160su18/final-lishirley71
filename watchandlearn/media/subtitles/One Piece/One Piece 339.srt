2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,510
Hi! Hello, everyone! Good day to you.

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,980
Don't be stupid! And what the heck is he?!

49
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,770
My, my! They're harsh!

50
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,440
Goodness, aren't you a lovely lady?
May I please see your panties?

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,150
Stop that, Harassment Skeleton!

52
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,780
Hey, Luffy! What's up with this guy?

53
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,280
Isn't he funny? I had him join our crew.

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,080
No, you didn't! I won't allow it!

55
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,590
Now, don't get so worked up.

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,750
Come on inside! Let's have dinner.

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,710
That's not for you to decide!

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,710
You're funny!

59
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,050
The Revive-Revive Fruit?

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,090
The Revive-Revive Fruit lets you...

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,810
...come back to life.

62
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,980
In other words, I'm a revived human.

63
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,440
It guarantees the mysterious
power of a second shot at life.

64
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,070
A revived human!

65
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,180
N-Now that I take a closer look,
you don't have a shadow!

66
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,530
You're right! What are you, really?

67
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,870
I have spent far too many
years drifting on these seas

68
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,920
to tell my story in one sitting.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,340
No!

70
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,670
Hey! What is it? What's wrong?

71
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,630
G... G-G-G...

72
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,090
Ghost!

73
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,180
Gah! Something's there!

74
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,800
Evil be gone! Evil be gone!

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm scared! It's a ghost!

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,110
Awesome!

77
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,860
It's running away!

78
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,030
Wh-What's causing that tremor?!

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,940
I-It couldn't be!

80
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,540
"Evil Be Gone"

81
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,960
What's going on?

82
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,790
"Evil Be Gone"

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,420
So how'd an island get there?

84
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,920
This is the ghost island
that wanders the seas...

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
...Thriller Bark!

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,080
Thriller Bark...

87
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,290
"One Unnatural Phenomenon After the Next!
Disembarking on Thriller Bark!"

88
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,840
Wait a sec! This isn't
showing up on the Log Pose.

89
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,100
That's hardly surprising. This island
came clear from the West Blue.

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,330
The West Blue?!

91
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah...

92
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,690
Hey, where are you going?!

93
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,020
Goodness, this is truly my lucky day!

94
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,990
Not only have I run into people, but my
heartfelt dream has also come true!

95
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,160
He's so agile!

96
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
Indeed! I became light on my feet
after I died and turned to bones!

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Please break through the gate towering
over you and escape with all due haste!

98
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,590
No matter what, do not
drop anchor by the shore!

99
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,390
It made me so very happy to meet you today!

100
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,070
I will never forget that scrumptious meal!

101
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,020
Well, take care! May we have the
fortune to meet on other waters!

102
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,770
Hey! Wait, Brook!

103
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,440
Isn't he a power holder?

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,090
Why on earth did he jump into the water?!

105
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,950
He's running on the water!

106
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,160
Wow! Awesome!

107
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,500
A-At any rate, Luffy, let's take his advice.

108
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,830
I have no idea what's going on, but this
island is clearly nothing but trouble!

109
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,300
Huh? Did you say something?

110
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,550
He's dying to go!

111
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,630
What's the deal with this Ghost Island?

112
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,750
Hey, where'd that ghost go?

113
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,430
Is it still on board?

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,430
No, it flew back toward the island.

115
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,020
That's probably where it resides.

116
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,520
Hey, about that large tremor
we felt a minute ago...

117
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,690
If that mouth-like gate
caused it when it shut,

118
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,400
I think that it essentially devoured us.

119
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,780
So it ate us?

120
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,990
It's hard to see through the fog,

121
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,170
but the fence extending from the gate
appears to encompass the island.

122
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,630
In other words, our ship is currently trapped

123
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,750
inside a fence that surrounds the island.

124
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,960
I get it! So that's why the skeleton
told us to escape ASAP!

125
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,890
Does that mean someone is making
this island "wander" the seas?

126
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,550
What's the point?

127
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,580
If the island is moving,
we're still in the middle of the ocean.

128
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,360
We can't drop the anchor here...

129
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,110
Whoa, there! Why do I get the
feeling you wanna stay here?!

130
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,820
We've gotta leave now!
We're gonna get cursed!

131
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,370
Listen, guys. I've come down with
Fear-of-unknown-islands-osis!

132
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,110
Same! I've caught the same bug.

133
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,120
Okay! Let's take her up to the shore!

134
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,370
Do you have Set-for-Adventure-osis?!

135
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,410
Think that over! Luffy, open up your eyes!

136
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,960
See that creepy building?!
It's a real haunted mansion!

137
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,220
You're taking malicious
spirits way too lightly.

138
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,220
What're you talking about?
I'm being super careful!

139
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm gonna catch that ghost
and keep it as a pet.

140
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,020
You're totally underestimating it!

141
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,520
And above all else, we have to
bring back our dear crewmate.

142
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Sanji, my pirate lunch!

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,610
Crewmate...? Hey, I'm
against you on that one!

144
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,360
I'd be too scared to sleep at night
if we had a skeleton for a crewmate!

145
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,400
I got your lunchbox.

146
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,280
Luffy! Franky! You'd better
be sure to protect Robin-chan!

147
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,120
There's nothin' like exploring
an uncharted island, is there?

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,250
You've gotta be kidding!
You're going with them, Robin?

149
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,920
I simply love the thrill.

150
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,550
All right! So, guys, we're gonna
take a small boat to disembark,

151
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,510
but I've still got a special
surprise I haven't shown you yet!

152
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,730
It's Soldier Dock System, Channel 2!

153
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,310
Two?

154
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,510
You heard me!

155
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,520
This system uses a total of five channels.

156
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,060
0 comes up twice.

157
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,800
1...

158
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,520
2...

159
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,950
3...

160
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,780
4!

161
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,240
Each dock has its own unique function.

162
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,360
Just a sec!

163
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,660
You've already revealed the paddle
wheel in 0 and the contents in 1 and 3.

164
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,980
But as I recall, you said
2 and 4 were still empty.

165
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,670
'Cause I was savin' them
for a special occasion!

166
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,750
Anyone steering clear of the island
should give it a quick spin!

167
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,970
Soldier Dock System, Channel 2!

168
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,770
Set out!

169
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,230
What is it? What's gonna pop out?

170
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,900
With its steam engine, this paddle
steamer that sits four is the Mini-Merry!

171
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,740
It's Merry!

172
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,490
Merry came back as a boat!

173
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,330
It's small, but now we can ride Merry again!

174
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,010
Sweet! I'm getting the hang of it.

175
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,150
H-Hey! Th-That looks bad!

176
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,980
We'll be fine! You can count on me.

177
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,450
I had no idea he was hiding
such a wonderful present...

178
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,840
Thank you, Franky!

179
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,760
I'll be more than happy to go shopping
for supplies in a boat like that!

180
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,050
Yahoo! Gimme a turn! I want a turn now!

181
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,100
You took "considerate" to a new level.

182
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,810
Hey! Hold your horses, Straw Hat.

183
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,400
We'll get to ride it in just a minute.

184
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,980
Let them have a bit of fun!

185
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,280
Is this everything, Franky?

186
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,490
Yeah. Including the 1 and 3
I've already shown you, this is it!

187
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,280
Channel 0: Support Paddles!

188
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,830
Channel 1: The one-man waver,
White Hobby Horse!

189
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,960
Channel 3: The three-man recon
submarine, Shark Submerge III.

190
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,250
And Channel 2: The four-man
errand boat, Mini-Merry!

191
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,600
At the moment, this is everything
the Soldier Dock System has to offer.

192
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,600
Consider them soldiers meant to
assist the Thousand Sunny's voyage.

193
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,810
I really love the way you think!

194
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,940
Franky, you rock! You rock! You rock!

195
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,610
--You rock! You rock! You rock! You rock!
--Yeah! I'm the ultimate man again this week!

196
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,360
Super!

197
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,370
Nami-san?!

198
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,660
Nami-san! What is it?!

199
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,160
What happened?!

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,580
What're they up to?

201
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,000
I can't see squat through this fog!

202
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,330
But her scream came from the island.

203
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,300
Guys, lemme ride the Mini-Merry already!

204
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,060
Jerk! You should be worried about Nami-san!

205
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,390
And you should be worried about
the other two on top of her!

206
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,270
I wonder if that scream means
a ghost killed them with a curse.

207
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,180
Stop that! Don't jinx them!

208
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,990
What was that?!

209
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,240
No one has touched the anchor!

210
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,960
It's too new for the
gears to be coming loose.

211
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,460
At any rate, raise it back up!

212
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,880
It's going to throw the ship off balance!

213
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,470
What? Did someone touch that?

214
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,430
No, no one went near there.

215
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,860
H-Huh?

216
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,400
Huh? Huh? Huh?

217
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,910
Luffy! What the hell are you doing?!

218
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,570
This isn't the time for games!

219
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,350
No, vit ishn't me! I'm vot doin' vis!

220
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,800
Look out, Straw Hat!

221
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,140
Hey, punk! What was that about?!

222
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,890
Hey, I'm sorry. My sword sprang out...

223
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,000
That's strange...

224
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,230
Looks like we're not the
only ones on the deck.

225
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,150
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

226
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,030
So we've got company, huh?

227
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,020
Was it a ghost after all?
Or was it some sorta psychic?

228
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,280
I could feel someone touching me.

229
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,190
I think I heard the sound of a
beast growling just a second ago.

230
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,740
A beast?

231
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,120
Anyway, I'm worried about
Nami-san and the others.

232
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,710
I'll let you deal with the ship!

233
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,500
What're you gonna do?

234
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,210
I'm gonna swim to the island
and save those three.

235
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,170
Wha--?!

236
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,340
What?! That was lame!

237
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Wow! Sanji's floating back up.

238
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,870
How's he doing that?

239
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,000
Whoa!

240
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,520
Gah!

241
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,770
You said, "Gah!"

242
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,030
Shut up! Why don't you give it a try?!

243
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,780
So it doesn't want us to leave the ship, huh?

244
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,610
I don't see what it's after.

245
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,200
If it wanted to kill us, we're wide open.

246
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,240
What's wrong, Robin-chan?

247
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,660
Something has caught me!

248
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,380
How dare you have your way with her?!

249
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,390
It really does sound like a beast!

250
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,390
Wh-What's going on?!

251
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,150
Look!

252
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,560
Waves are doin' that! Unnatural waves
are forming inside the fence!

253
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,860
They're carrying the ship!

254
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,400
Robin-chan, where is he?

255
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,490
We're in the clear. He seems to have left.

256
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,200
Hey, Gah! Raise the anchor!

257
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,450
We can't sail like this.

258
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,910
Who're you calling "Gah"?!

259
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,380
Usopp! Chopper! Answer me!

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,710
Crap! The current's pulling us
away from Nami-san.

261
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,880
Hey, Franky! Use one of the ship's
secret weapons to get us outta this!

262
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,340
Sure thing! I've got a Peek-a-Boo Vinyl Pool.

263
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,930
Sounds fun! Wait...

264
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,180
Are you a moron?!

265
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
Ouch, ow, ow, ow...

266
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,000
No wonder that hurt...

267
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,830
We fell all the way from up there, guys.

268
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,000
Where are we?

269
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,130
We're already on Ghost Island.

270
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,470
Ghost?!

271
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,680
Hey! Cut that out!

272
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,430
It makes me even more scared!

273
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,970
But how in the world did we get down here?

274
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,510
We got too excited over
Mini-Merry and ran ashore.

275
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,070
I got a bit overconfident, let it rip
and rammed into the wall.

276
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,820
That's when all three of us got sent flying.

277
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,070
Within seconds, we were at
the bottom of this trench.

278
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,290
I'm 100% at fault, but you'll
forgive me 'cause I'm cute!

279
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,910
I'm seriously gonna whack you!

280
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:39,510
"I'm sorry."

281
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,000
For one thing, isn't it weird
how all this fog appeared

282
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,670
when we entered the island?

283
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,700
Maybe it's a trap to deal with adversaries?

284
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,930
We should consider ourselves lucky
this wasn't lined with bamboo spears.

285
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,140
You're right! We're okay because
we landed on these skeletons!

286
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,740
Uh-huh.

287
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,180
I said cut that out!

288
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,600
But we've barely set foot on the island.

289
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,360
Luffy and the others will
come for us if we sit tight.

290
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,190
But I'm scared of being below sea level.

291
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,240
Fair enough. It's dangerous and hard to find.

292
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,700
At the very least, why don't we wait
for help on the shore at ground level?

293
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,540
So, like, which way takes us up?

294
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,610
What is that? A dog?

295
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,910
That's no dog.

296
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,500
Th-Then what is it?

297
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,270
H-Huh? C-Could that be C-Cer...

298
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,950
Cerberus?!

299
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,530
It's Cerberus!

300
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,890
Wh-What's Cerberus?!

301
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,350
I-I-I'm p-pretty sure it's
the watchdog of Hell!

302
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,790
Does that really exist?!

303
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,020
Sure does! It's right behind us!

304
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,080
Does that mean we're in Hell?!

305
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,460
No, I don't wanna know!

306
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,470
Just run! It'll eat us if we stop!

307
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,240
What's wrong, Chopper?

308
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,620
Chopper, what are you looking at?

309
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,660
"Yip"?

310
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,750
Hey, now that I take a closer look,
isn't one of them a fox?

311
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,810
Look! That hurt its feelings.

312
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,620
Must be a sore spot.

313
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,280
Yeah.

314
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,440
We ticked it off!

315
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,220
Now it's saying, "Pow!"

316
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,990
We must have hit a real sore spot!

317
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

318
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,560
Look! There is a staircase!

319
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,520
That will take us to the ground level!

320
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,280
Thank goodness!

321
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,160
Gah, it's persistent!

322
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,170
We hit a really sore spot!

323
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,880
Smoke Star!

324
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,190
It's a dog that doesn't have
a sense of smell?

325
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,810
It's gone!

326
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,500
What should we do?

327
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,810
It looks like we ran pretty
deep into the forest.

328
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,350
With that wandering around, we can't
wait somewhere that would stand out!

329
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,890
Certainly not!

330
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,360
Who're you?!

331
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,980
I am called Hildon.

332
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,570
I was afraid you might be in trouble
when I saw the feral dog chasing you,

333
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,700
so I snuck up from behind.

334
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,990
Don't sneak up!

335
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,420
As night falls upon the
forest around these parts,

336
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,980
it becomes so perilous it hardly
seems like it belongs of this world.

337
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,400
If you please, feel free to take
my carriage to the mansion.

338
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,620
There's a mansion?

339
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,570
Indeed, there is. You're welcome
to visit Dr. Hogback's mansion.

340
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,030
What?!

341
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,530
What? What is it?

342
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,490
What's the big deal, Chopper?

343
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,500
Hogback...

344
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,330
Huh...?

345
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,310
Who's that?

346
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,260
I never thought I'd get to meet
Dr. Hogback in my wildest dreams!

347
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,470
I'm so touched!

348
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,250
Who's this Hogback guy?

349
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,510
He's saved as many people
as there are stars in the sky!

350
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,410
Chopper! Hey, did you hear me?

351
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,110
I mean, he's a legend!

352
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,670
Maybe I should get his autograph.

353
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,310
Answer my question already!

354
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

355
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,400
"The Man Called a Genius!
Hogback Makes His Appearance!"

356
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
