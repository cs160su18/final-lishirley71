2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,050
How could this be happening?

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,320
I thought I clearly told you all goodbye.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,580
I'll never return to the Straw Hats!

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,320
You really think they'd be happy to be alive

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,550
knowing that it was because their
friend had to sacrifice herself?!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,510
Now that they know why you left them,

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,470
they'll follow you to the depths
of hell and take out your enemies!

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,750
It's you guys who don't get it!

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,900
I don't have the slightest desire to be rescued!

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,310
Don't just do as you please!

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,520
What are you making a racket for, Nico Robin?

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,560
Ramen Kenpo!

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,620
Noodle Stake Knocker!

15
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,750
Epluchage!

16
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,080
Con...vert!

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,800
"Convert"

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,550
"Pervert"

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,240
Don't tell me he's gonna...

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,290
Franky...

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,360
...Centaur!

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,600
Wrong way!

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,780
Your body should be in front!

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,970
Two-Sword Style Sword Draw...

25
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,640
...Rashomon!

26
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,290
We're not done yet.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,510
What the hell is that?!

28
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,400
It's a Sea King!

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,520
Further ahead on this railway...

30
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,350
...lies the one who cut that thing up...!

31
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,780
All, go back to the front cars!

32
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,950
This is a trap!

33
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,050
A trap?!

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,220
What the...?!

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,640
To think that I fell for the enemy's scheme...

36
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,850
What a blunder!

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,520
The gravest blunder of my life!

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,770
Well then, gentlemen! Have a nice trip!

39
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,650
I have to catch up... with the sea train!

40
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,410
If the criminals
we're supposed to escort

41
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,530
are set free upon the world again...

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,800
How much blood and how many

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,730
tears will civilians have to shed?!

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,040
I'll show them that there's justice
even in this unfair world!

45
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,050
Even if my arms and legs are
torn off by these raging waves...

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,960
...I will be sure to protect the
innocent citizens' future!

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,260
It's all right! Now let's move forward

48
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,660
with the sun always in our hearts

49
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

50
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,200
let's grab hold of our wishes

51
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,070
Working together,

52
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,870
let's ride the giant waves

53
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,160
Let's hurry toward the excitement--

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,480
there's the starting signal

55
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,630
Now's the time to set sail--

56
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,450
let's raise anchor

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,360
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,030
and head for a sea of adventure

59
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,600
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

60
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,410
but what you cherish most will be right there

61
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,420
And if you get into a jam

62
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,330
I'll always be there to protect you

63
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,630
It's all right! Now let's move forward

64
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,140
with the sun always in our hearts

65
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,570
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

66
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,480
and gaze at the light beyond

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,140
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

68
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,690
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

69
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,170
So let's grab hold of our wishes

70
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,740
under the same flag--

71
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,540
together, we're one

72
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,660
One Piece

73
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,760
"Clash! Demon-Slasher Zoro
vs. Ship-Slasher T-Bone"

74
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,270
What is that?

75
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,190
A sea train?

76
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,580
Is that a new sea train?

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,620
There's something there!

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,870
Hm? What's that?!

79
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,480
A person?

80
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,380
There's someone there!

81
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,650
That's Ship-Slasher!

82
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,590
What?!

83
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,360
S-Seriously?!

84
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,430
Ship-Slasher?

85
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,270
He's Ship-Slasher T-Bone,
a Captain at Navy Headquarters!

86
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,720
He cuts pirates ships up like steaks!

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
Oh, yeah?

88
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,220
That's amazing!

89
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,640
"Amazing"?!

90
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,400
You're talking
like it's someone else's problem!

91
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,640
We can't just sit around like this.

92
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,820
Hey, guys!
Get ready to fire!

93
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,940
Hurry up!

94
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,380
Yeah!

95
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,100
Wait!

96
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,970
What is it?!

97
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,580
We'd better hurry up
or he'll slash Rocketman!

98
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,920
What were you watching all this time?

99
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,540
Leave it to Zoro.

100
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,590
Don't interfere!

101
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,970
What?

102
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,300
I'll tell you only once!

103
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,270
Get out of our way!

104
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,950
They couldn't have simply
passed by my subordinates' cars

105
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,670
that were on the same railway.

106
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,280
What did these guys do to my subordinates?

107
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,330
They must be Nico Robin's crewmates...

108
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,210
...which means that that
swordsman is the pirate hunter!

109
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,420
This path leads to the origins of justice!

110
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm a captain at Navy Headquarters!

111
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,500
I will not live on in disgrace!

112
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,680
I'll stop you guys by slashing you in two!

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,310
I can't allow that...

114
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
...as our destination

115
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,350
lies beyond where you stand!

116
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,570
This guy is strong!

117
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,950
Bring it on!

118
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,960
I hate crooked sword attacks!

119
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,630
Right-Angle Flying Bird...

120
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,500
Three-Sword Style...

121
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,990
Bull Demon!

122
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,180
...Bone...

123
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,010
Phoenix!

124
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,110
He discerned it?!

125
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,820
Bold Hooves!

126
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,930
R-Roronoa!

127
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,280
He defeated Ship-Slasher!

128
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,480
To think that he followed
the sea train

129
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,400
from the detached cars
in this storm...

130
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,610
How admirable!

131
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,510
But we can't stop here.

132
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,900
I'm sure your justice is deep, too,

133
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,250
but we also shoulder all sorts of things.

134
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,700
Hurry! Hurry!

135
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,770
Captain T-Bone, who jumped
out to sea, is in danger!

136
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,020
He could've been hit by that sea train by now.

137
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,420
You bastard!

138
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,120
Be careful about what you say!

139
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,380
Our captain would slash a sea train
like that into two, you jerk!

140
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,670
But that swordsman was quite skilled!

141
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,440
Full speed ahead!

142
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,930
Our captain protected us
with his life

143
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,110
from a Sea King
that stood in the way!

144
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,370
Save our captain!

145
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,380
Yeah!

146
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,460
Roronoa Zoro...

147
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,650
How vexing...

148
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,730
I-Is that right?

149
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,940
That's right!

150
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,690
I'm sure it's Sanji-kun and
the others who detached that sea train.

151
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,020
Then, are we gonna catch up with them soon?

152
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,100
Probably.

153
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,180
All right!

154
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,280
We're closing in on our enemy!

155
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,570
Yeah!

156
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,430
Go, Rocketman!

157
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,000
We're gonna
beat up the pigeon guy!

158
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,750
We somehow...

159
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,800
pulled it off?

160
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,820
No...

161
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,560
there's something different after all.

162
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,740
That's right! This smell...!

163
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
This place is filled with the
smell of those filthy pirates!

164
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,540
Something is definitely wrong!

165
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,670
Yikes!

166
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,090
Is something wrong?

167
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,710
What?! Wh-Why?!

168
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,900
H-He's coming back!

169
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,130
I-I got slashed!

170
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,800
Oh? I didn't get slashed!

171
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,760
Furthermore, if you lack love in
something as small as peeling skins,

172
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,150
no matter what dish you make, it'll taste bad.

173
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
Kitchen knives aren't swords,

174
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,400
so I won't cut people with them.

175
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,970
However, you should notice
that you lost your armor.

176
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,530
Kitchen Knife Throw!

177
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,570
You son of a...

178
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,550
Oeil!

179
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,680
M-My eyes are caving in!

180
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,290
Let them.

181
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,880
Now, stop fighting and give up.

182
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,740
You fool! Why would I?!

183
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,500
I don't get why the heck you
want to rescue a woman like that!

184
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,450
You guys don't actually know
Nico Robin's true nature, do you?!

185
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,920
That woman is...

186
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,010
Nez!

187
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,040
Joue!

188
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,170
Bouche!

189
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,090
Dents!

190
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,400
Menton!

191
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,450
If you keep talking,
I'll reshape your body.

192
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,020
H-H-Hold on a sec!

193
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,910
I-I feel like my face shrank!

194
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,620
Stop it!

195
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,890
I-If you don't know
about her, I'll tell you.

196
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,490
Everyone knows it!

197
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,550
She's a depraved devil!

198
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,430
Parage... Shot!

199
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,040
D-D-Dammit!

200
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,300
My face caved in!

201
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,320
Mirror! I need a mirror!

202
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,750
Y-Y-You bastard!

203
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,130
H-How dare you dent my proud eyes and nose?!

204
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,810
Serves you right!

205
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,130
You are evil!

206
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,730
Oh, hey, they went back to how they were.

207
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,160
Ah! Y-You're right!

208
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,340
I felt like
they went back a little just now.

209
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,860
Th-That was just an illusion.

210
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,820
You're guilty of three sins.

211
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:16,780
What?

212
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,240
First,

213
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,440
you claimed to be a cook in front of me.

214
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,840
Second,

215
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,340
you treated food with no respect.

216
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,790
Third...

217
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,590
...you insulted our friend.

218
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,030
Hiss!

219
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,890
You're the very definition
of "all bark but no bite."

220
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,100
I can't tell what part became stronger
after becoming four-legged,

221
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,400
centaur!

222
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,950
I-I-I'm gonna fall!

223
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,590
You look pathetic.

224
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,170
Dammit!

225
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,170
Shall I give you a hand?

226
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,430
Ahhh! Waaah!

227
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,180
You bastard!

228
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,200
Not quite...!

229
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,650
You're gonna give me a hand?!

230
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,290
I'm doing just fine, you fool!

231
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,540
I've finally caught you.

232
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,530
Now tell me if you still think my
being four-legged was pointless!

233
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,790
Shut up, you jerk!

234
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,220
Give me my characteristics back!

235
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,000
You stupid jerk!

236
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,050
My friend is waiting to be rescued on
the other side of the door behind you.

237
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,350
If you get it, get out of my way.

238
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,610
When I say I won't let you
go through, I really mean it!

239
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,580
Ramen Kenpo! Secret technique!

240
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,720
Noodle Cutter Poisonous Kitchen Knife!

241
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,790
If you touch it, you'll die!

242
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,080
Now, now, now, now!

243
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,010
Aren't you guys being
deceived by that woman, too?!

244
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,140
She's the lowest of the low,
who lived one betrayal after another,

245
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,180
and survived until today in the underground!

246
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,890
I'll take your life!

247
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,210
Take this!

248
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,740
Three-Spot...

249
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,650
Decoupage!

250
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,940
Hiss!

251
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,240
I got my hands and legs blocked!

252
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,310
I let my guard down!

253
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,420
You let your guard down?

254
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,600
Go ahead and make excuses.

255
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,000
If you like,

256
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,280
why don't you add your last words
to them while you're at it, buddy?

257
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,240
Are you thinking that you can
still keep fighting, by any chance?

258
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,330
What?!

259
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,290
Well, it's just natural,
since you dodged all my attacks...

260
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,450
Since you don't know how
destructive my blow really is...

261
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,850
Ultimate Hammer!

262
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,770
Hey, where on earth did you come from?

263
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,840
Yow!

264
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,180
Did you finish taking
care of the ramen guy?

265
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,570
Yeah, I did, just now.

266
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,440
They're the ones

267
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,130
who kidnapped Robin-chan,
aren't they?

268
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,370
We had a dream that day

269
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,210
Our belief in ourselves

270
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,250
makes us able to cross

271
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,220
the wildly surging ocean

272
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,720
You're braver and more caring

273
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,390
than anyone else

274
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:02,110
If you ever depart this ship

275
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,940
and live in a different world

276
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,740
In the end,

277
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,370
we can all surely smile

278
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,870
Robin-chan! I wanted to see you!

279
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,760
Let's go back together this time!

280
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,640
Sanji-kun, it seems that she's
objecting to your opinion.

281
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,470
Why, Robin-chan?!

282
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,220
I've got a plan.

283
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Look.

284
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,140
One moment will decide the game!

285
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,880
On the next episode of One Piece!

286
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,050
"Scramble over Robin!
A Cunning Plan by Sogeking!!"

287
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
