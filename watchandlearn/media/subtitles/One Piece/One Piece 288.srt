00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,310
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,320
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,970
My treasure?

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,820
If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,960
Find it!

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,380
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,670
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,680
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,650
and set out in search
of something to find

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,440
ONE PIECE!

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,370
Compasses only cause delays

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,860
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,760
If the dusty treasure map

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,810
has been verified,

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,200
it's not a legend!

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,260
When it comes to personal storms,

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,600
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn't there!

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,540
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search
of something to find

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,490
We are, We are on the cruise!

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,800
We are!

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,000
Wealth, fame, power...

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,640
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

30
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,210
My treasure?

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,380
If you want it, you can have it!

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,800
Find it!

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,830
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,280
I can see the Gates of Justice now,

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,390
but is it possible to go there
on a regular boat?

41
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,730
I don't have much time anyway.
I guess I'll try something.

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,230
Here we go!

43
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,250
Whoa! Pirate guy!

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,050
What're you doing?!

45
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,790
Sanji-kun...

46
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,060
Were you really
not able to defeat her?

47
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,540
Did you really fight seriously?

48
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,010
It was that woman who
you fought, wasn't it?

49
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,510
You're soft with women.

50
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,260
I'm sorry about the key.

51
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,610
That's not it!

52
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm saying that because
of that stupid chivalry,

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,190
you're gonna lose your life!

54
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,240
You're gonna stick to it even
after getting hurt like this?!

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,900
What're you gonna do if you die?!

56
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,070
It's not like...

57
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,910
I want to die.

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,030
But

59
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,210
I grew up having the idea that
I shouldn't kick women beat into me.

60
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,250
So...

61
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,540
even if it costs me my life...

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,210
...I won't kick a woman!

63
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,590
You're a fool.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,670
Fool!

65
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,510
Hey! What're you doing, Nami?!

66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,320
If running away is also
against your chivalry,

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,600
at least ditch that chivalry!

68
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,020
It's not worth dying in vain over.

69
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,850
Leave that woman to me.

70
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,250
Also...

71
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,860
I think a little more of
your chivalry than I did before.

72
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,890
What?!

73
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,080
Did she just say
that she loves me more?

74
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,530
No, she didn't!

75
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,420
I'm not kind.

76
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,650
Neither am I.

77
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,480
Sounds like we can get along.

78
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,600
Yoyoi!

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
Hold it!

80
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,230
The octopus guy!

81
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,900
I won't...

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,250
I won't let you get away!

83
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,040
Nami, you go deal with that woman!

84
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,660
I'll do something about this guy!

85
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,030
Okay!

86
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,090
Yoi! Yoi! Yoyoyoi!

87
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,350
Are you going to be in my way?!

88
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,420
Cloven...

89
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,380
Cross!

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,530
How dare she?!

91
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,270
She got away again!

92
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,020
You're dealing with me!

93
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,280
Come on!

94
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,710
"Fukurou's Miscalculation!
My Cola Is the Water of Life"

95
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,850
Seriously, there's no way you can cross
water like this on a boat, now is there?

96
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,350
Are you an idiot?!

97
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,180
But Robin was taken to those gates!

98
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,270
Unless I hurry up, I won't
be able to bring her back!

99
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,440
I should be able to reach the
building right in front of it, right?

100
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,360
Hey! What're you doing?!

101
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,820
Wait, pirate guy!

102
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,320
Calm down!

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,910
If I can't cross the sea,
then I have no choice but to jump!

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,710
We came to tell you how to
get to the Gates of Justice!

105
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,750
What?

106
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,420
What's this place?

107
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,490
A basement?

108
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,200
It's an undersea passage.

109
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,610
To get to the
Gates of Justice, you go under the sea.

110
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,580
I see.

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,940
Okay, then!

112
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,160
Hey, wait!
Do you know how to get there?!

113
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,280
In any case, you're amazing.

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,290
I'm impressed that you knew
about a passage like this!

115
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,640
I saw Lucci's servant going down
the stairs laughing very loudly.

116
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,300
So I followed them.

117
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:38,770
"The servant"

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,400
If they don't know where the entrance is,
they can't come after us!

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,770
Serves them right!

120
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,730
Lucci and that black-haired lady
went through the doors, too.

121
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,490
So these are the ones, huh?

122
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,420
These are quite strong iron doors.

123
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,400
Do you know how to open them?

124
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,960
The servant was touching around here,

125
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,290
so I bet you can operate
them with this keyhole...

126
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,550
...though we don't have the key.

127
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,630
You guys, stay back.

128
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,280
Huh? What're you gonna do?

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,450
We can go to the Gates of
Justice through here, right?

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,170
Er... Yeah...

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,250
Third Gear!

132
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,250
They opened...

133
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,470
All right! I'm heading there now!

134
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,930
What?! How come you're small now?!

135
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,620
That pirate guy sure is interesting!

136
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,890
Now, let's get back to work, too!

137
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,180
I-I just heard a loud noise.

138
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,250
Was that my imagination?

139
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,020
No, it couldn't have been.

140
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,020
Could that noise have been one of
the pirates destroying the doors?

141
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,430
What?! That's not possible!

142
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,030
Those are thick iron doors!

143
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,850
Besides, there's no way that
they could find those doors!

144
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,980
Well, they should know where they are,
since a child and her pet were following us.

145
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,200
What?!

146
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,820
I-If you knew that,
why didn't you kill them?!

147
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,190
Because...

148
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,410
...I was given no such order.

149
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,740
Wh...

150
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,410
What?! You idiot!

151
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,310
For something so trivial,
use your own discretion!

152
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,330
Can't you tell what'll happen if
you don't do anything about it?!

153
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,730
So what're you saying?!

154
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,810
Are you saying that
someone's headed this way?!

155
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,890
I would say that's the case.

156
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,680
Ahh! I'm scared!

157
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,010
Oh, shut up!

158
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,180
Oh, that was me.

159
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,150
Listen, Lucci!

160
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,200
Your main priority
is to protect my life!

161
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,140
You got that?!

162
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,270
Also, kill anyone
who tries to get in my way!

163
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,000
Defying me is an act of rebellion
against the World Government!

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
They deserve to be killed!

165
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,200
Huh?! What's that look?!

166
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,150
You have no time to worry
about others, Nico Robin.

167
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,630
Hell is already around the corner.

168
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,450
Lucci! Bring her already.

169
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,440
All right! My body's back to normal!

170
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,120
Just wait, Robin!

171
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,090
I'll be sure to beat the crap
out of that pigeon guy!

172
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,220
Well, it was his own fault
that Sanji-kun lost...

173
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,580
...but what in the world
did she do to him?

174
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,050
What's with this woman?

175
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,090
She's got some nerve.

176
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,850
Dammit! When I have to refill
my cola as soon as possible...

177
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,850
For someone with such a large body,
he sure does like to jump around.

178
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,550
Chapapa... I'm right here.

179
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,260
Seems like you're at least quick
when it comes to escaping.

180
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,070
Chapapa...

181
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,770
I'm under no obligation
to take your proud punches.

182
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,440
Franky Triangle Jacker!

183
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,090
Chapapa.

184
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,320
No way...

185
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
I'd get
hit by sideburns like that!

186
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,530
I've got you!

187
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,380
Weapons Left!

188
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,960
Seems like I'm almost out of cola.

189
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,980
I'd better go to the kitchen now!

190
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,300
Hold it!

191
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,920
Dammit! He dodged my attack!

192
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,510
Damn wimp, you're an
expert at running away!

193
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,030
Chapa!

194
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,390
What'd you say?!

195
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,760
What's the matter, wimp?

196
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,810
You're not running away this time?

197
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,760
You bastard!

198
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,230
You made me mad with that word!

199
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,830
Take my killer fist!

200
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,160
It's a super heavy punch combined
with Finger Pistol's speed!

201
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,320
Solid Beast!

202
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,000
Chapapa...!

203
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,370
Such a modest, ineffective punch...

204
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,010
Strong...

205
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,090
Iron Body!

206
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,390
...Hammer!

207
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,810
That was a pathetic punch.

208
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,480
Solid Beast!

209
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,170
Your punches are flabby.

210
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,900
No.

211
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,810
Your punches are limp.

212
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,710
Then, your punches are flimsy.

213
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,750
Your underpants are lazy.

214
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,850
Underpants?

215
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,320
They're not punches!

216
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,360
Underpants! That's what you are!

217
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,320
You damn bra jerk!

218
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,280
Shut up, socks!

219
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,150
Long johns!

220
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,260
Loose shorts!

221
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,090
Loincloth!

222
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,190
Chapapapapa!

223
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,300
Get off of me, you bastard!

224
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,960
Shut up, change purse!

225
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,690
All right!

226
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,580
I was able to enter the kitchen!

227
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,040
There it is! A huge refrigerator!

228
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,610
Is that him?

229
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,890
A gorilla
power holder... probably...

230
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,480
Dammit!

231
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,890
Three minutes have already passed?

232
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,090
I used the rumble ball too soon.

233
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,690
What am I gonna do?

234
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,570
Yoyoi!

235
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,300
Disappear from this world!

236
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,160
This is the finishing blow!

237
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,370
Yoyo...!

238
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,420
You bastard!

239
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,420
Good! It's got a lock!

240
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,960
Chapa! Kumadori!

241
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,010
All right! I locked him in!

242
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,340
How dare you...?

243
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,890
Hey, hold on a sec, gorilla!

244
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,390
I need that fridge!

245
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,990
Ahh! CP9 and the punk!

246
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,260
I'm Franky! I'm on your side, remember?!

247
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,410
Who'd you call a gorilla?!

248
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,150
You're too slow!

249
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,900
Listen.

250
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,310
Just like Luffy,
I haven't forgiven you yet.

251
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,740
The reason Usopp left us was...

252
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,850
It all goes back to you!

253
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,510
Give us Usopp back!

254
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,540
Like I said, you guys
were with him earlier.

255
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,060
That's not important right now!

256
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Don't you wanna save Nico Robin?!

257
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,000
I do! Robin!

258
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,100
Then get three bottles of cola from
that fridge and give them to me!

259
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,250
With cola, I can power up!

260
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,400
I'll take care of these guys in
an instant and take their keys!

261
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,110
What kind of idiot actually
gets stronger with cola?

262
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,870
Shut up! That'd be me!

263
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
Just how long...

264
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,860
are you gonna
keep up the comedy act?!

265
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,310
On top of that, you were trying to
have a tea break during a battle?

266
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,220
How rude!

267
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,610
Solid Beast Secret Technique...

268
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,750
...Owl Thrashing!

269
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,920
Chapapapapa!

270
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,360
Beans Left!

271
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,890
What was that?!

272
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,870
Ahh! This is terrible!

273
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,120
That's right!
He's on our side right now!

274
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,060
I'll do what he told me to.

275
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,150
If I open and close the door
within a second, he can't come out!

276
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,740
Yoyoi!

277
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,580
The door has...

278
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,750
All right!

279
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,270
Franky!

280
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,540
Thanks!

281
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,180
Fresh!

282
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,640
What the...?

283
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,440
Freshness is most important!
Vegetable Punch! Take this!

284
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,560
Solid Beast.

285
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,750
Hey! That was vegetable juice!

286
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,240
Why would I want health to
be a priority, you bastard?!

287
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,120
Give me cola!

288
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,200
Oh, so it wasn't because he was thirsty.

289
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,160
Yoyoi! The door...

290
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,960
Here you go!

291
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,420
Thanks!

292
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,380
I'm feeling good!

293
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,340
Well...

294
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,110
...let me sit.

295
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,400
My work in
the field is done for now.

296
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Stop being so upset.

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,310
Don't fight.

298
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,910
Why don't you have some tea?

299
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,400
Tea wouldn't...

300
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,320
...give me energy! You moron!

301
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,150
He's... funny.

302
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,360
Hey!

303
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,810
What's with that "I wonder what
happens with other drinks" look?!

304
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,540
This'll be the last time, you damn deer!

305
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,970
So it doesn't depend
on how you're feeling?

306
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,120
I need only cola!

307
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,210
That's cola! Cola without a doubt!

308
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,840
Thanks!

309
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,440
I don't know what the deal is,
but I'm not gonna let you have your way!

310
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,690
Tempest Kick!

311
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,640
Franky!

312
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,970
Super!

313
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,780
Chapapa... What's the deal?

314
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,390
It's not like drinking cola would
make a difference or anything.

315
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,360
Guard yourself.

316
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,180
Chapa? What a fool.

317
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,320
Are you gonna give me
another pathetic punch?

318
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,070
Strong... Hammer!

319
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,090
Whoooa! Amazing!

320
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,140
Sorry.

321
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,040
My punches earlier were...

322
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,950
...indeed pathetic.

323
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,680
Zoro-kun, what's your idea
to get these handcuffs off?

324
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah. Now that it's come to this,
we'll play rock-paper-scissors

325
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,020
to decide whose wrist
we'll resolutely...

326
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,060
Ahh! What's with you coming
up with such a scary idea?!

327
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,020
There's no way we could do that!

328
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,150
Really?

329
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,020
Then, I've got another idea.

330
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,240
Ahh! Ahh! I don't wanna hear it!

331
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

332
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,690
