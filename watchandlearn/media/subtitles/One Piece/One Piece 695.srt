69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,880
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,010
Luffy and the others formed
a pirate alliance with

80
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,070
Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,650
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,050
they were trapped along with the entire island.

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,060
I'll pay 100 million berries
for each star rating!

84
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,750
100 million berries?!

85
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,690
On top of that, he put prices on
the heads of Luffy and 11 others,

86
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,210
and now they're being hunted
by all the citizens.

87
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,090
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

88
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,050
Luffy and Law are heading
to the Royal Palace!

89
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,470
Is that...

90
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,690
Sugar is awake now!

91
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,810
Oh no!

92
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,960
It sent chills down my spine

93
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,280
when I realized Robin had been
turned into a toy, too, earlier!

94
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,200
I didn't even realize
I had forgotten about her!

95
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,930
If Sugar touches Luffy,
I'll forget about him like that!

96
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,040
Your friend disappears
and you won't even know it!

97
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't take it!

98
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,210
I have no option left now!
I'll shoot her from here!

99
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,430
Do you know the position you're in?

100
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,640
Our bond can't be broken
even if anyone tries.

101
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,490
Just remember.

102
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,600
If Luffy ever calls for my help,

103
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,980
no matter where I am in the world,
I'll be there - forget my position!

104
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,770
Dodge, Farul!

105
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,010
Farul!

106
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,370
Stay with me!

107
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,640
What a powerful jaw!
It crushed his head!

108
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,540
Don't die on me, Farul!

109
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,420
Are they invincible?!

110
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,800
Pop Baller!

111
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,680
Oh no! My Yellow Cubs...

112
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,520
Robin-san!

113
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,220
Rebecca, take the key to the Sunflower Field!

114
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,030
I'll be fine!

115
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,030
Cien Fleurs!

116
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,430
Wing!

117
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,670
Robin!

118
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,700
Luffy! Tra-guy-kun!
You guys are here!

119
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,080
She got away...

120
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,280
Well, she's just one little tramp.

121
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,590
I know she can't do anything
even if she can get to the Palace.

122
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,500
Luffy! Tra-guy-kun!
And Soldier-san, too!

123
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,950
Just go now!
To the Sunflower Field on the fourth level!

124
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,800
That's right!

125
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,350
Rebecca's waiting for you!
Just go!

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,980
Okay.

127
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,270
"Risking Their Lives!
Luffy is the Trump Card for Victory!"

128
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,520
It's the fourth level! We're here!

129
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,410
Uh-huh! Thank you all!

130
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,170
Thank you, Yellow Cubs!

131
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,650
Thank you!

132
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,490
Robin-san and Bartolomeo-san...
Are they okay?

133
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,700
I know they are!
Usoland's friends are strong!

134
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,450
Yeah! You're right!

135
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,930
Uh-huh!

136
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,340
Rebecca-sama!
We have to go save Princess Mansherry now!

137
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,230
Uh-huh!

138
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,900
Is it okay to leave you here alone?

139
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,750
I'll be fine! Lucy and the
others will come soon!

140
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,300
Go save her!

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,180
Okay!
Rebecca-sama, you take care, too!

142
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,450
Uh-huh!

143
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,620
Soldier-san is a brave man

144
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,780
He will always be by your side

145
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,270
Father-sama must be
somewhere on this battlefield, too...

146
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,940
Somebody made it here, huh?

147
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,250
It's you...

148
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,030
Gum-Gum...

149
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,410
--Luffy-senpai, let me take this!
--Crest Head!

150
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,860
Barrier!

151
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,700
Those are balls of explosives!
They'll explode before you deflect them!

152
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,290
Wow! Cool!

153
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,680
Oh no! I don't deserve such praise!

154
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,950
Bartolomeo...

155
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,030
Go!

156
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,810
Gum-Gum...

157
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,380
...Jet Whip!

158
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,440
Cool!! I just saw his Second Gear
and Jet Whip up close!

159
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,110
So impressive!

160
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,570
Hey, Straw Hat-ya, just get rid of them
and let's move along already!

161
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,530
You're taking too much time!

162
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,830
Hey, you!
Don't talk to Luffy-senpai like that!

163
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,630
I've got an idea!

164
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,960
Barrier-bility: Stairs!

165
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,070
Awesome!
You saved us a lot of trouble!

166
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,700
Please use it, Luffy-senpai!

167
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,470
Why're you looking the other way?

168
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,910
Thank you, Crest Head!

169
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,530
Th...

170
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,290
...a...

171
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,040
...n...

172
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,790
...k...

173
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,910
...you?!

174
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,810
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank...

175
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,590
Not at all!

176
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm the one who has to thank you
for being born!

177
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,820
All right!

178
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,200
We can go straight to the fourth level this way!
Let's go, Tra-guy!

179
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,220
Go!

180
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,560
Issho-san! Ow! Ow!

181
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,120
No good! We can't get closer
because of the fire!

182
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
We can't go around either because

183
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,650
the collapsed buildings are blocking our way!

184
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,640
The Flare-Flare Fruit!

185
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,570
The troublesome guy gained
a troublesome power!

186
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,820
Fire Fist!

187
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,480
Hey you...
What are you trying to do?

188
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,560
I know Navy admirals are much more powerful!

189
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,960
Stop messing around!

190
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,470
You're an odd person.

191
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,940
I thought you wanted to keep us Navy at bay.

192
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,990
How long will you keep up with the act?

193
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,540
Oh boy...

194
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:15,620
As you can see,
I need people to go easy on me...

195
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,080
I don't discriminate.

196
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,100
You scare me.

197
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,220
You're not known as No.2 of the Revolutionary Army
for nothing, I guess.

198
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,110
But I'm in the position that
requires me to do this.

199
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,740
Please understand.

200
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,810
Gravity Blade!

201
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,840
Raging Tiger!

202
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,180
Gravity Blade!

203
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,720
Raging Tiger!

204
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,610
Horizontal gravity?!

205
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,540
Yeah! This is just what I expected from him!

206
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,220
This jerk! What is he up to?!

207
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,990
It's an all-or-nothing gamble.

208
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,160
I'm determined to bet my life on it.

209
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,460
However...

210
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:51,130
If you lose your dice,
the game is over before you can even roll.

211
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,180
The Top Executives of our Family are
guarding this plateau...

212
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,470
I didn't think anyone could reach it
but there was a slight chance, so...

213
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,450
...I've been waiting but...

214
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,020
Rebecca!

215
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,730
I can't believe you made it here.

216
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,630
Soldier!

217
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,860
I'm gonna go first!

218
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,490
Oh, wait, Soldier!

219
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,160
Cabbage!

220
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,120
I'll keep them here! Just go, Straw Hat!

221
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,250
My beloved horse was harmed
on this level!

222
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,280
I can't go farther without
vengeance against those jerks!

223
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,720
Go!

224
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,610
Luffy, dodge! It's the bombs!

225
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,190
Let me take care of it!

226
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,280
Why not use your barriers?!

227
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,900
Hey, Bartolomeo!

228
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,750
What were you doing?!

229
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,050
There is a limit on the size of the barrier...
that I can produce at once...

230
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,430
And I used it up on that staircase!

231
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,480
But that's all right!

232
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
If it helps Luffy-senpai...

233
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,760
I'm happy to die!

234
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,410
I am!!

235
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,330
You son of a...

236
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,240
I'll fight with you until you're
able to use barriers so hang tough!

237
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,750
These dolls have no delicacy!

238
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,800
Cinco Mano! Spank!

239
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,790
Nico Robin!

240
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,210
I know how you feel...

241
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,880
Rooster-kun.

242
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,070
Our captain is...

243
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,520
...worth risking...

244
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,720
...even our lives!

245
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,700
Luffy is always
the trump card that leads us to victory!

246
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,500
Mil Fleurs! Gigantesco Mano!

247
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,730
--I won't let you lay a finger on Luffy!
--That's right!

248
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,640
I'm coming now!

249
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,970
Wait for me, Mingo!

250
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,020
The Top Executive, Diamante,
launches powerful attacks while

251
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,090
Rebecca struggles desperately to hold on!

252
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,680
But she is finally driven into a corner,
moments from losing her innocent life,

253
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,730
when the legendary, undefeated warrior,

254
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,310
Kyros, shows up at the Sunflower Field!

255
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,350
On the next episode of One Piece!
"A Tearful Reunion! Rebecca and Kyros!"

256
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,680
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
