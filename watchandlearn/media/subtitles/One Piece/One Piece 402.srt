2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,330
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,180
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,860
Seeking a ship coating craftsman
to help them reach Fishman Island,

51
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,060
the Straw Hat crew landed
on the Sabaody Archipelago,

52
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,110
where they met Rayleigh, a craftsman and the
former vice-captain of the Roger Pirates.

53
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:54,310
Luffy and company headed into town to
hide while Rayleigh coated the Sunny,

54
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,760
but Admiral Kizaru, an assassin
dispatched from Navy Headquarters,

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,480
has already arrived at the
Sabaody Archipelago...

56
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:09,340
Hello? This is Kizaru. Hmm? How odd...

57
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,930
Hello?

58
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,970
--Now! Take this!
--S-Stop...!

59
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,740
Hello?

60
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,240
Fierce battles broke out everywhere
between the navy and the rookies...

61
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,660
It turned big--!

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,230
What's going on?!

63
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,210
He didn't do anything himself!

64
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,600
Well, actually, if I can't find him,
then that leaves me with spare time...

65
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,220
And if I'm not busy, I obviously
can't let a wanted man go...

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Especially one like you,
with a 249 million bounty...

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,860
..."Magician" Basil Hawkins!

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Speed is weight!

69
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,570
Have you ever been kicked
at the speed of light?

70
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,470
Captain!

71
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,250
Captain!

72
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,170
Impressive. You far surpass what I imagined.

73
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,980
And yet another "Bartholomew Kuma"
appeared before Luffy and company...

74
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,100
--Get back, Luffy!
--He's one of the Warlords of the Sea!

75
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,930
A Warlord?! How come you guys know that?!

76
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,770
Don't let that attack hit
you! It's a shockwave!

77
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,450
What is this?!

78
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,580
He can do this, too?!

79
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,340
Hey! You lied about it being a shockwave!

80
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,920
Second Gear!

81
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,180
We know he's strong, so let's
go all-out at the very start!

82
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,390
Something's off here...
He seems different from last time.

83
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,640
He better hurry.

84
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,230
They're going to...

85
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,580
...get rid of all the rookies!

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,770
"Overwhelming!
The Navy's Fighting Weapons, the Pacifistas"

87
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,540
Unbelievable...

88
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,660
From his hands and his mouth...

89
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,460
Frightening!

90
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,460
Here comes another! Here comes another!

91
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,690
Here it comes!

92
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,450
Wh-What the hell are those things?!

93
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,050
They're beams, obviously!

94
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,860
Beams of light would make incredible
weapons, but that's just fantasy!

95
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,150
Wait... what are you doing?

96
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,060
Playing dead.

97
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,260
He's already seen through that!

98
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,550
Three-Sword Style...

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
...Gum-Gum...

100
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,520
...Diable...

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,110
...Mouton...

102
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,270
...Jet...

103
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,310
...600 Pound...

104
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,230
...Cannon!

105
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes! Did they get him?!

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,530
They're amazing!

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,170
This is a Warlord of the Sea.

108
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,660
I don't think it'll be that easy,
judging from their expressions...

109
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,660
He's that different?!

110
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,380
Maybe he's a twin, then?!

111
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,970
Yeah, it's a possibility!

112
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,420
Anyway, the real one would've
teleported and dodged our attacks...

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,310
More than that, he doesn't use shockwaves,

114
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,790
and doesn't got paws, either!

115
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,940
But if this is a fake,
then that's the real problem.

116
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,620
That'd mean there are
two guys who're this strong.

117
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,120
You gave me quite a thrashing.

118
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,370
Don't think I'm the same
as I was before, though!

119
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,790
Karma Exposure!

120
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,060
That must've hurt a little...

121
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,700
Mad Monk Urouge, a man who has
continually escaped death to this day,

122
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,250
has such power after growing in size...

123
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,700
So how can this be?

124
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,300
Hot!

125
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,820
That was Kizaru's laser!

126
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,200
Vegapunk! You've recreated
Kizaru's offensive abilities

127
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,490
using Bartholomew Kuma's body?!

128
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,610
I had no idea the Pacifistas
had already reached this point!

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,530
This is no ordinary situation!

130
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,530
Definitely not! Not even three
people worth over 100 million

131
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,460
can survive against a
Warlord and a navy admiral!

132
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,970
Rear Admiral Drake.
Oh, I mean former Rear Admiral.

133
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,770
Don't tell me you're here to
conduct surveillance on them?

134
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Go ahead, try fighting it.

135
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,910
I think your inside knowledge will make
your despair all the greater, though.

136
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,110
I suggest that you little
hatchlings exercise caution.

137
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm here too, you see!

138
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,240
What another incredible sight!

139
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,410
A rare ancient Zoan type!
I've never seen one before!

140
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,070
Oh? I'm surprised red blood flows inside you.

141
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,910
What a rare sight...

142
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,540
As I said, I'm here too.

143
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:59,400
All you people worth over 100 million
are monstrous and frightening...

144
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,810
Demon-Conquering Form!

145
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,530
He disappeared?!

146
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,530
M-My eyes!

147
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,550
Captain Hawkins!

148
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,440
I... can't see...

149
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,100
I don't know what power you have,
but you do have a physical form.

150
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,470
You don't seem to be a Logia type...

151
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,200
Captain!

152
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,210
This is bad!

153
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,910
He's going over his damage limit!
He's really gonna die!

154
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,860
You'll be the first to go...

155
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,660
You did well to journey all this way.

156
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,070

157

164
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,780
What's this?

165
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,610
Here we go!

166
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,700
Check it out!

167
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,980
Got 'em!

168
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,520
Though I doubt that'd be
enough to beat a navy admiral!

169
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,560
Whew, I managed to see
so much interesting stuff!

170
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,730
Well, it's time for me to scram! So long!

171
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,410
How terrible...

172
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,820
What a shock that was...

173
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,340
Yata Mirror.

174
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,870
What's that?

175
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,310
Hello?

176
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,700
Huh? Hello?

177
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,710
Oh, here it is.

178
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,990
This is Borsalino.

179
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,880
What the hell, Uncle!
You do have a Baby Transponder Snail!

180
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,830
Why didn't you contact me?!

181
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,830
Oh?

182
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,300
Oh, Sentomaru-kun!

183
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,930
Don't give me, "Oh!" What are you doing?!

184
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,060
You're on the island now, right?!

185
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,900
Oh, I wasn't able to get
ahold of you, you see...

186
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,150
Don't tell me you were talking into
the Black Transponder Snail again!

187
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,600
I told you before that the black one
on your wrist is for eavesdropping!

188
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,770
Oh, yes...

189
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,380
Whatever! Just get to work now!

190
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,700
The culprits have split up!

191
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,550
Straw Hat Luffy,
Captain Kid, Trafalgar Law...

192
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,700
Which do we start with?

193
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,620
Oh, you don't say? In that case...

194
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,010
108 Pound Cannon!

195
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,190
Concasser!

196
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,570
108 Pound...

197
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,720
You idiot! What're you doing?!

198
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,970
Zoro!

199
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,450
Hey, Zoro! You got hurt so
much you can't even move?!

200
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,890
Forget about him, Luffy!

201
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,280
We need to beat this thing first!

202
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,800
Yeah...!

203
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,000
He hasn't even had the chance
to fully heal from last time!

204
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,680
Just standing up to him
must be pretty damn painful,

205
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,190
judging by that look of his again!

206
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,970
Bastard...

207
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,920
If you ain't Bartholomew Kuma,
then who are you?!

208
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,020
You look exactly like
the Warlord of the Sea...

209
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,110
What the hell's goin' on here?!

210
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,780
Another enemy?!

211
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,700
I got the toughest defense in the world!

212
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,570
As such, my mouth is sealed just as tight!

213
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,770
Who are you?!

214
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,530
I have no reason to answer anything!

215
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,070
I'm the most tight-lipped guy in the world!

216
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,170
And my name is...

217
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,460
You're gonna tell us, then?!

218
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

219
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,820
"An Even Stronger Enemy Appears!
The Battle Axe-Carrying Sentomaru"

220
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
