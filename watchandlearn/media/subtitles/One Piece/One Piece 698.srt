Hey Let's go

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,380
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,600
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,650
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,510
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,550
they were trapped along
with the entire island.

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,740
On top of that, he put prices on
the heads of Luffy and 11 others,

84
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,250
and now they're being hunted
by all the citizens.

85
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,980
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,790
Luffy and Law are heading
to the Royal Palace!

87
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,680
However, Sugar closes in on Luffy
and Law with her evil intention...

88
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,400
Neither Trafalgar Law nor
Monkey D. Luffy know me.

89
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,240
It's easy to approach them.

90
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,880
Hey, Luffy!

91
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,090
The seas without you,
I don't ever wanna see that!

92
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,910
I see them!

93
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,000
Special Long-Range Attack! Bagworm!

94
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,190
What?

95
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,630
Sugar-sama!

96
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,800
Oh no! She passed out again!

97
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,980
If you're all right,

98
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,750
just go ahead!

99
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,860
We're here, Mingo!

100
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,300
Let me just make sure.

101
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,960
Just in case, I'm wrong.

102
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,670
You two, what did you come here for?

103
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,170
To kick your ass!

104
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,880
The same here!

105
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,310
I'm disappointed...

106
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
"Anger Erupts!
Luffy and Law's Ultimate Stratagem!"

107
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,190
What?!

108
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,180
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF
THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 3

109
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,500
I thought they were giant toys...

110
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,570
...but each of them was actually
made up of eight people.

111
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,220
They turned their own soldiers into toys?!

112
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,430
How could they do that to their own people?!

113
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,310
No way...

114
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,700
Sugar passed out again?!

115
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,230
Sugar-sama!

116
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,020
Sugar-sama, stay with us!

117
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,040
Sugar-sama!!

118
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,070
It was terrible!

119
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,770
We thought we'd live as toys
for the rest of our lives!

120
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,480
That wouldn't be!

121
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,420
We were gonna turn you back
as soon as the battle ended, of course.

122
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,250
Th-That's what I thought!

123
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,510
--Good to hear that!
--I'm relieved!

124
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,140
Of course, we didn't even remember...

125
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,890
...their existences.

126
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,810
All right!

127
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,060
My barrier is fully recharged!

128
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,570
I won't let you guys ascend any farther!

129
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,160
You think you got the better of me
just because the toys are gone?!

130
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,110
That groundless confidence of yours,

131
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,830
I'll smash it into pieces!

132
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,740
I won't let you get in Luffy's way!

133
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,220
I'm gonna take down an Executive of
the Don Quixote Family

134
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,920
and become even more popular!

135
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,300
THE TOP FLOOR OF THE ROYAL PALACE

136
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,410
Bellamy!

137
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,960
Do you care about him?

138
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,920
I thought you two had a fight
in Mock Town.

139
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,560
When did you guys become friends?

140
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,130
Hey! Hey!

141
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,350
When?! When?!

142
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,110
Hey! When? When?
When?! Hey, hey!

143
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,230
You're such a delusional dumbass!

144
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,500
Listen. The era where pirates
dream about things is over!

145
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,500
Forget about the past!

146
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,710
Let go of Bellamy!

147
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,970
That's...

148
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,630
...up to the winner to decide!

149
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,100
This fool came to get killed by me.

150
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,630
Right, Bellamy?

151
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,940
You entered the competition at the Colosseum

152
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,790
to become an Executive of my Family.

153
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,180
But you got defeated pathetically.

154
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,350
That's more than enough reason to be killed

155
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,790
but I gave you another chance.

156
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,830
Which was, if you kill Straw Hat,
I'll make you an Executive.

157
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,640
But you failed again so you shall be killed.

158
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,610
Don't you think so, Bellamy?

159
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,680
I'm gonna get on board Doflamingo's
ship to ride through

160
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,710
the "wild wave" that will
come sooner or later.

161
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,420
I'm done picking on you.

162
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,050
Doflamingo has been my pirate hero
since I was a kid.

163
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,410
I can't betray Doflamingo!

164
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,940
I look up to him!

165
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,370
This is how you take
responsibility, isn't it?

166
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,630
Bellamy.

167
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,470
You idolized me of your own will

168
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,470
and got desperate when things
didn't go as you'd wished.

169
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,470
People can't change their nature.

170
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,820
No matter how far you go,
you're just a cheap thug.

171
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,310
Bellamy!

172
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,750
What are you saying?!
Bellamy has changed!

173
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,170
It's okay now...

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,770
Just...

175
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,510
...kill me... already...

176
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,060
Hey, Straw Hat-ya!

177
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,670
Let go of Bellamy!

178
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,810
Mingo!!

179
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,190
Sorry, Bellamy!!

180
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,020
Didn't we agree on this earlier?

181
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,510
Straw Hat-ya! If you show
your anger or hatred,

182
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,260
you're giving the enemy what he wants!

183
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,330
Hold back! Stirring our emotions is...

184
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,360
...his tactic.

185
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,710
If you lose your cool, you could get killed.

186
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,260
Like I almost did in the first battle.

187
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,110
Doflamingo is
an ironhearted, ruthless man.

188
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,280
He's always looking for
a chance to get you!

189
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,150
In the face of your dying friend...

190
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,630
You kicked him! Didn't you? Yes!

191
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,870
You just kicked him!

192
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,990
You idiot!

193
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,350
What did you say?!

194
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,100
Don't listen to him!

195
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,400
How dare you say I'm ironhearted!

196
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:30,410
Law, I'm not as ironhearted as you think.
I'm pretty mad.

197
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,370
Think what you guys have done.

198
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,700
First, you began by destroying
the SAD manufacturing machine.

199
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,380
Then, you laid your hands on
Vergo and Monet

200
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,180
and kidnapped Caesar.

201
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,830
Later, here in Dressrosa,
you freed the toys throughout the country.

202
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,230
Your associates are trying to destroy the SMILE factory
even now!

203
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,230
I've had it enough already!

204
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm smiling just because
I can't get any madder!

205
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,700
And what is worse, you think you can kill me.

206
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,580
It's been disastrous since
you guys came along.

207
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:27,490
Feels like I'm reliving the despair of
13 years ago!

208
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,360
If that hadn't happened,

209
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,690
I wouldn't have shown up
in front of you like this!

210
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,990
If that hadn't happened,

211
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,140
you would've been here as the third Corazon!

212
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,840
Black Knight!

213
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,550
The clone again?!

214
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,230
Then, I'll fight...

215
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,310
...the real one!

216
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,460
Bellamy?!

217
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,740
Hey, why're you doing this, Bellamy?!

218
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,340
I said sorry for what I did!

219
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,900
Straw Hat-ya!

220
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,950
He's being manipulated!

221
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm sorry, Straw Hat...

222
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,350
Please...

223
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,400
...stop me!

224
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,320
Commodore...

225
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,870
...Hug!

226
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,240
A lite version of King Punch!

227
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,890
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 2
THE COLOSSEUM ARMY VS THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY

228
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,290
Destruction Cannon!

229
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,310
Guillotine High-Heel!

230
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,700
Your Destruction Cannon can
destroy anything, right?

231
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,570
Ah! I love it, too!

232
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,190
Destruction!

233
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,190
Ton, ton...

234
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,590
Ten-Ton Vise!!

235
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,700
You're my target!

236
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,620
What?!

237
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,350
I'll knock you out!

238
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,360
Barrier-Barrier! Barrier Crush!

239
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,260
Mil Fleurs!

240
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,500
Gigantesco Mano!

241
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,020
Stomp!

242
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,550
Blade of Beauty! Round Table!

243
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,910
Señor!

244
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,560
THE SMILE FACTORY

245
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,040
Come on!

246
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,920
Great!

247
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,060
That's pointless...

248
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,270
I thought I felt a gentle breeze.

249
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,810
No!

250
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,860
--So hard-boiled!
--So cool, Señor!

251
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,430
You're too tough!

252
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,750
You bring it on this time!

253
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,910
Give me more than that...
That won't work against me at all!

254
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,270
I thought a caterpillar was crawling
on my cheek!

255
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,480
--He's awesome!
--Fraland!

256
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,020
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF
THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 4

257
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,430
I don't know how you know him but...

258
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,100
...if you wanna stop him,
you gotta knock him out!

259
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,000
Just do so! Straw Hat!

260
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,640
I can't do that!

261
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,760
You're my friend!

262
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,920
You're gonna die soon...

263
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,840
Not a bad way to die, huh?

264
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,010
Do you remember
what I told you once, Law?

265
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,730
The weak have no choice about how they die!

266
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
That bastard!

267
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,030
We came this far
but you still don't fight us yourself?!

268
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,120
Tra-guy!

269
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,130
I'm gonna kick his ass now!

270
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,130
He's pissing me off!

271
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,420
Idiot! I told you it's our ultimate stratagem!
I also told you not to get heated!

272
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,340
I'm gonna do it now! Gum-Gum...

273
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,260
You fool!
I'll teach you a lesson later!

274
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,440
He's going to attack Law!

275
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,350
Are you going nuts, Straw Hat?!
This is fun!

276
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,820
Room!

277
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,400
Shambles!

278
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,060
...Red Hawk!

279
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,830
Doffy!

280
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,980
Radio Knife.

281
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,360
Straw Hat-ya! You're the worst!

282
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,980
You, too, are...

283
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,540
...from that generation!

284
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,130
Pulling off their tricky stratagem,
Luffy and Law go on an offensive!

285
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,960
However, when Doflamingo,
who's anger hits its peak,

286
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,900
launches horrific counterattacks
and corners the two again,

287
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,270
Luffy and Law learn
the shocking truth of the Warlord Doflamingo!

288
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,820
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,760
"A Noble Family! The True
Identity of Doflamingo!"

290
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,190
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
