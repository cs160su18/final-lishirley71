The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

there will be a chain of
burning, intense excitement!

Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,460
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,970
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,690
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,940
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,060
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

73
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,860
and have come to Dressrosa.

74
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,920
They freed the toys who had been forced to
labor as slaves

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,520
but Doflamingo trapped everybody in the country
in the Birdcage

76
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,580
and put prices on the heads
of Luffy and 11 others.

77
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,750
Now, those of you who rebel
against our family...

78
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,430
What?

79
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,270
I'm gonna fight you!

80
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,120
His voice! It's so high!

81
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,960
Run!

82
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,730
Run! It's gonna crush you up!

83
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,210
Luffy!

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,220
Luffy!!

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,650
"Gathering into a Powerful Front!
Luffy and a Group of Brutal Warriors!"

86
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,660
What?! What?!

87
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,190
M-My hand...

88
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,360
--My hand - it's slipping!
--What?!

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,310
I won't let you fall!

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,680
Usoland!

91
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,700
Th-Thank you, Leo!

92
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,010
That was close.

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,770
But what was that?
What caused the big shake?

94
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
I can't believe it...

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,350
I'm scared!

96
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,980
The town got squashed.

97
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,070
If he throws another one,
it'll be dangerous to be here!

98
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,650
Let's run!

99
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,640
To where?!
His fist can reach the edge of the town!

100
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,040
With a single blow...

101
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,160
Luffy! Law!

102
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,030
Where are you?!

103
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,450
Hey!

104
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,320
Zoro!

105
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,790
Hey!

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,740
We're up here! Up here!

107
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,910
Luffy!

108
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,650
I got hanged!

109
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,560
Let me down now!

110
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,520
Get off of me now!

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,680
Sorry, sorry!

112
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,160
What's wrong with you?!
Trying to hurt me?!

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,980
--Huh?
--Don't give me "Huh?"!

114
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,420
Boy, how reckless can you be?

115
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,250
Laughing at Pica's voice means death.

116
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,070
Look how far we've got!

117
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,220
Where are we?

118
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,620
I don't know.

119
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,280
I think we got even farther away
from the Royal Palace.

120
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,730
Damn that stone assimilation human!

121
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,280
He ended up being even bigger than Oars!

122
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,950
If only I knew how to beat him...

123
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,230
Straw Hat.

124
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,930
Cabbage!

125
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,490
You're Pirate Hunter Zoro, aren't you?

126
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,640
And Trafalgar...

127
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,640
...Law!

128
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,830
Give me back...

129
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,350
...my glory, you scoundrels
of the Worst Generation!

130
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,400
What are you doing?! He's with me now!

131
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,480
No, I'm not!

132
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,410
What?! Do you still hold
a grudge against me?!

133
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,560
No, I'm not gonna go after
you Straw Hats anymore.

134
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,280
Because one of your crew,
God Usopp, saved my life!

135
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,850
Usopp did?

136
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,780
That's right! I won't ever
forget the brave image of him

137
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,410
when he saved hundreds, sacrificing his life!

138
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,140
Although I didn't see it.

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,850
Well, I'm happy when
somebody says nice things about my friends.

140
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,670
Oh yeah!

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,370
Trafalgar.

142
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,420
This is your hat, isn't it?
I found it in front of the Colosseum.

143
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,360
Let me put it on you.

144
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,710
Come closer, now!

145
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,230
I don't trust you!

146
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,370
Well, who cares. I'm busy now anyway.

147
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,990
Do you wanna know why I'm busy?

148
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,020
No.

149
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,590
All right, I'll tell you if you insist!

150
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,700
I've decided to kill Doflamingo to
return you guys the favor!

151
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,670
What?!

152
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,180
Leave the rest to me and go hide somewhere...

153
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,360
No thanks! I'm gonna do it!

154
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,480
I have to return Rebecca the favor
for buying me lunch!

155
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,100
Your reason to fight was food?!

156
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,760
Cut it out! I know you're trying to fool me!

157
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,440
You plan on stealing more attention
by killing Doflamingo, don't you?!

158
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,320
The spotlight?!
What are you talking about?!

159
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,940
Think about it.

160
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,380
If you take down a vicious pirate like Doflamingo,
newspapers won't leave you alone!

161
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,220
A flood of people will come to hear your story
from morning 'til night!

162
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,270
"Hello, superstar!"

163
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,560
Did you call me "superstar"? Oh, please!

164
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,330
"What do you want?"

165
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,680
"Cavendish-san! What do you think of
the situation regarding pirates in recent years?"

166
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,240
"Oh? You're there, aren't you?!
Cavendish-san?!"

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,160
What's wrong? I'm right in front of you!

168
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,240
"You are?! But I can't see you
because you're so bright!"

169
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,330
Is it too shiny for you?! I'm sorry!
But I can't hide my brilliance!

170
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,870
"Wow! You really are a star!"

171
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,440
Alright.

172
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,940
Let's go.

173
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,860
Now, burn my image into your mind as
much as you want! I am a superstar!

174
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,590
Let's see!

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,820
I don't see Straw Hat's dead body!

176
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,830
Maybe, it's been completely destroyed
or it got blown away.

177
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,000
Or he got away.

178
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,840
Where did you go? Straw Hat!

179
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,640
His voice! It's so high!

180
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,540
Find him! Let me know if he's still alive!

181
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,610
I won't let him reach Doffy!

182
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,780
Luffy, you know that strange guy we just met?

183
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,120
Oh, you mean Cabbage?

184
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,220
Cabbage?
Are you kidding? Is that a name?

185
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,310
I met him at the Colosseum.

186
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,340
There were a whole bunch of
strange people besides him!

187
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,290
Oh yeah?

188
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,360
There they are!
One 200-million and two 300-millions!

189
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,570
Don't let them get away!

190
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,600
Take this!

191
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,760
Gum-Gum...

192
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,910
...Whip!

193
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,780
Two-Sword Style!

194
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,540
Rhino Cycle!

195
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,620
There they are!
One Two-star and two Three-stars!

196
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,490
We got more!

197
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,180
Hey, Luffy!
If we fight them all, it'll take forever!

198
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,560
--Let's go!
--Okay!

199
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,000
There you are, Straw Hat!

200
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
Get out of my way!

201
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't stand in my way!

202
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,240
--Get out of my way!
--That voice is...

203
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,230
Wait, Garp's grandson!

204
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,230
DON CHIN JAO - THE HAPPOSUI ARMY (A GANG)

205
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,440
SAI - THE LEADER OF THE
HAPPOSUI ARMY (A GANG)

206
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,420
We've been looking for you, you bastard!

207
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,670
BOO - THE VICE LEADER OF
THE HAPPOSUI ARMY (A GANG)

208
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,670
You can't get away from us!

209
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,190
Ugh! I thought so!

210
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,280
--Wait!
--Oh no! Run!

211
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,760
Huh? What's the matter?!

212
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,520
Why are you running?!

213
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,120
They are all persistent!

214
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,270
--Wait!
--They just won't give up!

215
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,460
Why can't you wait?!

216
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,280
Head-Arms!

217
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,470
I said wait, Garp's grandson...

218
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,240
Don't get me wrong, Garp's grandson.

219
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,760
I don't hold a grudge against
your family anymore.

220
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,360
What? Really?

221
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,010
We originally came to this country to
take down Doflamingo's business.

222
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,370
We don't care about prizes!

223
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,370
We don't work for
such a small amount of money!

224
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,760
I was saved by not just you
but one of your crew, God Usopp.

225
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,110
--Usopp saved you?
--Indeed.

226
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,270
Therefore, I have made
up my mind to return you

227
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,020
and God Usopp the favor
by taking down Doflamingo.

228
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,220
Don't do it!
I'm gonna kick Doflamingo's ass!

229
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,200
What did you just say?!

230
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,680
I said "Don't do it"!
Because I'm gonna do it!

231
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,200
What?!
Are you going to disregard my kindness?!

232
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,790
HAJRUDIN - A WARRIOR OF ELBAPH

233
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,790
There you are! Straw Hat Luffy!

234
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,910
Oh! You!

235
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,420
Let's just forget what happened in the match!

236
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,540
For my pride as a warrior of Elbaph,

237
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,450
I will kill Doflamingo and return you guys the favor!

238
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,660
--Now it's you...
--Cut it out!

239
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,050
We of the Prodence Kingdom have...

240
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:56,190
ELIZABELLO II - THE KING OF PRODENCE

241
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,180
...long been in debt to King Riku!

242
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,190
I will bring down Doflamingo!

243
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,790
DAGAMA - A MILITARY TACTICIAN

244
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,650
Th-That's what he says!

245
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,810
We don't want any prize!

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,780
No, we are the ones who will kill that jerk!

247
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:12,730
JEET AND ABDULLAH

248
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,830
The heavenly light shone down on God!

249
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,800
It's hard to forget after all!

250
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,730
Let me make a confession!

251
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Wait, wait!

252
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,510
ORLUMBUS - A COMMODORE OF A FLEET

253
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,870
If you're talking about Doflamingo,
I will take him down!

254
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,340
"DESTRUCTION CANNON" IDEO

255
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,340
Destruction is my repayment!

256
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,350
SULEIMAN

257
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,350
It's my job to execute someone!

258
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,280
BLUE GILLY - THE LONGFEET TRIBE

259
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,280
No! I will take out Doflamingo!

260
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,720
Where are all these idiots coming from?

261
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,690
Don't forget about me!

262
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,710
Here comes the annoying one.

263
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,690
Hey, do you guys really wanna...

264
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,360
You have to leave the task of
killing Doflamingo up to us!

265
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,290
I can't back out on that!

266
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,230
I need to repay my debt!

267
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,180
What the hell is going on here?!

268
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, how about this?!

269
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:09,240
We will take down Doflamingo!
And you guys will back us up!

270
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,150
No way! I will take down Doflamingo! Huh?!

271
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,800
I'll do it!

272
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,270
No good... There are too many egos.

273
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,990
Guys...

274
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,880
All of you! That's enough!

275
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,330
I said I will kick Doflamingo's ass!

276
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,330
What did you say?!

277
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,260
We said we'll return the
favor - don't you get it?!

278
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,900
Why don't you shut up or I will kill you,
you dimwitted savior!

279
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,540
That's right! Back off...

280
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,560
I will do it!

281
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,090
I will destroy him!

282
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,300
I am the executioner!

283
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,280
Duty!

284
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,680
Popularity!

285
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,880
Pride!

286
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,480
King Riku!

287
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,190
Our God!

288
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,030
A spear?

289
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,230
--There they are!
--Guys, let us help you!

290
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,470
One 200-million and two 300-millions!

291
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,910
They are the ex-toys who were locked
up underground with us, aren't they?

292
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,710
You're right. They certainly are.

293
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,980
What shameless assholes!

294
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,750
Catch them!

295
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,060
Go to hell! You ungrateful bastards!

296
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,380
--Let's go.
--Okay.

297
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,540
Moocy!

298
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,180
A bull?

299
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,920
I got an idea!

300
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,540
I see a shadow behind the smoke!

301
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,090
Oh, n-no!

302
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,410
A-A bull?

303
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,860
Go!

304
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,940
There they are! Pica-sama, I found them!
It's the Straw Hats!

305
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,890
They came back!

306
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,140
Don't let them get away!

307
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,380
They're riding a bull!
The three of them from earlier...

308
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,770
And four, five...

309
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,270
Six...

310
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,630
Seven!

311
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,490
Wait, Straw Hat!

312
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,790
Stop following me, I said!

313
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,890
Th-They are...

314
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,450
...increasing in number!

315
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,530
I will take down Doflamingo!

316
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,240
Enough! If you guys get in my way,
I won't hesitate to slice you all up to kill him myself!

317
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,310
Don't be so selfish!
We are the ones who'll do it!

318
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,200
No way! It's me!

319
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,900
No, me!

320
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,380
Luffy, what should we do about these fools?

321
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,610
Stop following us! I will
kick Doflamingo's ass!

322
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,880
No, I'll do it!

323
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,820
--How did they get so many
guys on their side suddenly?!

324
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,830
--How do I know?!

325
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,120
They were the competitors from the Colosseum!

326
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,530
P-Pica-sama?!

327
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,530
What's going on?

328
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,420
He's moving!

329
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,230
He's aiming at us!

330
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,860
I'm gonna bring him down!

331
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,630
No, I'm gonna do it! Don't get in my way!

332
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,290
That's absurd! Leave it up to me!

333
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,700
You boneheads! Stop talking shit!

334
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,080
What an unfitting voice!

335
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,220
It's impossible! That voice!

336
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:44,030
Three or three-hundred,
it doesn't matter to me!

337
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,850
Here it comes!

338
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,480
Count on me!

339
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,990
I'm gonna crush you all at once!

340
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,260
I'm right behind you!

341
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,130
Hasshoken Secret Technique!
Drill Dragon...

342
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,000
Although I'm not fully charged...

343
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,250
A lite version of...

344
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,640
...King...

345
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,780
...Punch!

346
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,350
...Nail!

347
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,020
Damn you!

348
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,880
Pica-sama's arm!

349
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,440
You did it! Grandpa!

350
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,360
That's my king!

351
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,250
We're gonna take down
Doflamingo just like this!

352
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,250
Stop following us!

353
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,020
Shut up, you idiotic savior!

354
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,550
What did you say?!

355
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,300
The group of ruffians led by Luffy is
on their way to the Royal Palace!

356
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,490
However, giant Pica relentlessly throws down

357
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,440
his fist on them and blocks their way!

358
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,310
When everyone thinks it's all over,
just before Pica's devastating attacks,

359
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,030
Luffy finally shows his
stunning ultimate technique!

360
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,290
On the next episode of One Piece!
"Steady Progress! Luffy's Army vs. Pica!"

361
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,990
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
