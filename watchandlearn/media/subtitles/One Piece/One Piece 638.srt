Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,480
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,720
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,160
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,030
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,120
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,210
When Luffy found out that
the prize for a fighting

77
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,410
event was the Flare-Flare
Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,990
The first round is a battle royal
where only one can win.

79
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,650
Burgess from the Blackbeard Pirates won
the match of Block A.

80
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,150
Now, the battle of Block B has begun.

81
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,920
Competitors led by Dagama, the tactician,
are protecting Elizabello II,

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,070
the king of Prodence Kingdom!

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,120
When is he going to throw
the devastating King Punch?!

84
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,970
Bellamy!

85
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,870
"Atrocious"! "Evil"!

86
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,810
Those are the words only fitting to this man!

87
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,750
Is he the top contender
to beat Elizabello II after all?!

88
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,600
In the meantime,
the Jiaokungdo martial artist - Blue Gilly

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,640
and the mysterious gladiator - Ricky,

90
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,860
the two strong men are fighting each other!

91
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,530
4000 Brick...

92
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,190
...Fist!

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,910
Just kidding!

94
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,320
What did he do?!
Hack is the one who collapsed!

95
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,690
What was that?

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,310
Wh-What kind of monster are you?!

97
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,110
Bartolomeo!

98
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,820
"A Deadly Blow!
The Astonishing King Punch!"

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Hack got defeated!

100
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,380
He couldn't even reach Bartolomeo!

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,560
What did Bartolomeo do to him?!

102
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,320
Damn! I was rooting for Hack!
That chicken head!

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,310
Gyats-san, you have to be fair!

104
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,620
Relax!

105
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,940
We can't see a clear winner yet!

106
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,240
B Block - 24 competitors remain.

107
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,330
It's gonna be over soon, huh?

108
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,380
He looks like something.

109
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,550
Everybody's got a wound or two now!

110
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,760
It's about time!

111
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,420
Powerful competitors are getting eliminated
one after another!

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,020
Following Hack's defeat,
the unknown gladiator,

113
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,380
Ricky, also got taken down!

114
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,540
Blue Gilly is strong!

115
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,180
--Blue Gilly-sama!
--So cool!

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,960
What do you think you can cut

117
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,590
with such a blunt sword, old man?

118
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,320
I guess I can't fight aging.

119
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,770
I can't stand all this cheering.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,870
I can't stand you, Doflamingo!

121
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,340
There aren't that many men left
thanks to Dagama's tactics!

122
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,920
Yeah.

123
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,580
Most of the competitors are gone
except for us.

124
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,810
Can't believe I'm still here.
I'm glad that I allied with them!

125
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,810
Me, too!

126
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,260
When Dagama gives us the cue,
we'll disband.

127
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,840
Then we'll fight amongst ourselves
until one of us wins.

128
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,430
Let's take down as many
enemies as possible for now!

129
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,210
I know!

130
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,940
Blue Gilly!

131
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,530
Here he comes!

132
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,300
Guys! Take care of Blue Gilly
while we're fighting together!

133
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Okay!

134
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
Dagama?!

135
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,050
You did a fine job, you stupid dogs!

136
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,040
Why?

137
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,920
Hey, you haven't given us the cue!

138
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,560
Don't tell me he... Hey, Dagama!

139
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,670
You two!

140
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,940
Sorry! I've been told to hunt you dogs!

141
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,100
Were you plotting together?

142
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,880
To get rid of us from the beginning?

143
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,220
I will pay you later!
Your job is done now!

144
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,520
Dagama!

145
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,930
Warriors who can't use their brains

146
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,260
just end up as someone's
puppets on a battlefield!

147
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
I'll be counting on you, Longfeet man!

148
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,040
Now you turned your back to me,
you're dead, too.

149
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,410
Blue Gilly.

150
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,540
We of the Prodence Kingdom

151
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,780
will win the Flare-Flare Fruit
at any cost!

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,250
What?!

153
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,420
You betrayed me, Blue Gilly!

154
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,980
Dagama the tactician got eliminated!

155
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,000
--Way to go, Longfeet guy!
--Blue Gilly-sama!

156
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,830
I can't believe people would trust a

157
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,770
dubious guy like him
in the first place.

158
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,350
Oh? On the other hand...

159
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,960
--Go, Bellamy!
--Kick his ass!

160
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,190
Our man - Bellamy is beginning to attack!

161
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,230
His target is the "most annoying pirate
who should just go away"!

162
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,780
Bartolomeo!

163
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,600
Huh? Me?

164
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,720
Just go away already!

165
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,190
What?!

166
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,020
Bellamy who went in for the attack
is down on the floor?!

167
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,740
What did Bartolomeo do?!

168
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,920
Bellamy delivered an attack
and got hurt like Hack!

169
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,210
What did he do to him?

170
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,180
What did he just do?

171
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,380
Damn it all!

172
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,790
I shouldn't be...

173
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,860
...struggling like this right here!

174
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,810
Go, Bellamy!

175
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,880
Spring...

176
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,350
...Death Knock!

177
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,640
I-I can't believe it!

178
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,600
Our man - Bellamy is worn out!

179
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,320
What kind of Devil Fruit did he eat?!

180
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,440
Bellamy! You can do it!

181
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,430
Bellamy...

182
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,650
I've no interest in the Flare-Flare Fruit

183
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,440
but I have my own reason to win this thing!

184
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,870
I'm gonna get on board Doflamingo's
ship to ride through the

185
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,040
"wild wave" that will come sooner or later.

186
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,590
I'm done picking on you.

187
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,950
Hey, Bellamy! Don't give up!

188
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,310
Now what are you gonna do, Elizabello?

189
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,470
Nothing is more helpless than a king
without his court.

190
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,360
Everybody was dying to kill you.

191
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,250
All the people who had been guarding you

192
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,260
have turned against you.

193
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,700
What's the matter?

194
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,100
You can't do anything
without Dagama, can you?

195
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,100
Dagama did a great job.

196
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,590
I'm all set now.

197
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,280
All I need to do is throw it!

198
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,430
You guys are the ones who were protected

199
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,010
while we were in that battle formation.

200
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,220
Because nothing is more dangerous
than an exposed blade.

201
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,090
Don't you think so, you punk?

202
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,680
Hey, I just thought of something.

203
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,330
What?

204
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,160
There was a report about
the king of Prodence.

205
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,810
They said he destroyed an

206
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,030
enemy country's fort
with a single punch.

207
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,850
No way! He must've used some kind of weapon.

208
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,960
No, they say it could take down
even the Four Emperors!

209
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,550
What?

210
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,120
If it's true, he's gonna throw a punch that

211
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,170
will destroy this part of the Colosseum!

212
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,110
What?!

213
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,350
No way! That can't be true!

214
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,320
I've heard the same thing!

215
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,670
No! He can't throw such a destructive punch
at a place like this!

216
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,430
There is a restlessness in the air!

217
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,820
The king who kept quiet

218
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,380
in the battle formation is
now on the move!

219
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,990
We of the Prodence Kingdom will win
the Flare-Flare Fruit!

220
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,780
Hey!

221
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,260
Hey, are you listening?
What do you wanna talk about?

222
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,850
Like I said, in order to
destroy the SMILE factory,

223
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,830
I gotta beat up someone in the Doflamingo...

224
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,960
Halt.

225
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,700
What?

226
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,790
I'm busy! I've got work to do!

227
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,370
I'm sorry but I have no time for this.

228
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,710
If you have nothing to talk about, I'm gonna go now!
Bye!

229
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,220
You...

230
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,280
You keep talking about this radical plan

231
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,660
but why do you want to do such a thing?

232
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,700
You seem like you know things
that ordinary people don't!

233
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,840
What is your true purpose?

234
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,140
My true purpose?

235
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,300
What's going on?

236
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,690
Damn!

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,790
This doesn't look good!

238
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,690
You've got to be kidding!

239
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,280
Whoa-whoa, we better go!

240
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,120
Run!

241
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,870
Maybe, he really did destroy the fort!

242
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,840
You're so persistent!
What's this?! Get it off of me!

243
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,850
No way! Don't underestimate
the power of my spring!

244
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,020
King...

245
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm gonna kill Elizabello!

246
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,960
Outta my way!

247
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,060
Shooting...

248
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,270
...Punch!

249
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,560
What's going on in the Colosseum?

250
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,230
How...

251
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,400
How powerful was that?!

252
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,950
I don't think anyone in the
ring could survive that!

253
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,900
Elizabello II wiped out all of his enemies...

254
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,170
...with a single punch!

255
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,010
What a man!

256
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,330
That was a hell of a punch!

257
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,890
I've never seen something like that before!

258
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,270
Bellamy! Blue Gilly!

259
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,470
And all other potential
winners have been eliminated!

260
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,570
The battle royal of Block B - 138
competitors - the winner is from

261
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,690
the Prodence Kingdom...

262
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,510
Hey, look! Somebody's there!

263
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,580
You see? Right over there!

264
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,900
The audience in that direction
didn't get blown away

265
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,690
because of his defense!

266
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,170
Barrier!

267
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,790
People can create barriers
by crossing their fingers.

268
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,340
It's common knowledge!
Even kids know it!

269
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,420
I'm a barrier human who ate
the Barrier-Barrier Fruit!

270
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,020
Barrier Crash!

271
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,300
"The Fighting King" - Elizabello
II got knocked out!

272
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,220
The winner of Block B is...

273
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,680
Dammit!

274
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,610
...Bartolomeo!

275
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,030
All of you, go to hell!

276
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,890
--Go away!
--Screw you!

277
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,270
What? That strange guy won.

278
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,880
I will dedicate the Flare-Flare Fruit
to that person!

279
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,210
Then, you, too?!

280
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,470
Shh! Shh!

281
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,660
You're too loud!

282
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,200
You're plotting to destroy the factory, too?!

283
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,500
Indeed! My friends and I have been
carrying out preparations for it!

284
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,940
Tell me where it is!
I'll destroy it right away!

285
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,120
You can't do that!

286
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,310
Why?!

287
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,950
Because we want to save the
workers in the factory!

288
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,570
The workers in the factory?

289
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,390
Yes!

290
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,080
Our plan could lead to
the fall of this country!

291
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,270
It's a big project!

292
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,530
If you have the nerve and are
determined to go against Doflamingo,

293
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,030
I'm going to tell you everything
about this tragic kingdom - Dressrosa!
