2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,770
So you're gonna join our crew now, right?

48
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,480
I promised one of my comrades something.

49
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,820
I must tend to that first
or I will lose face!

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,600
Yeah. You're talking
about Laboon, aren't you?

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,030
I know all about it.
Franky and Robin told me.

52
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,610
Huh? Oh, that's right.

53
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,410
Laboon! That is the name of the whale.

54
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,700
He is at a certain cape--

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,220
Listen, Brook! We met Laboon
at Twin Cape. Honest!

56
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,290
J-Just a moment, please!

57
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,670
I'm shocked! This is so sudden.

58
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,260
Is it true? Did you actually meet Laboon?

59
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,310
Yup.

60
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,350
Is that right?

61
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,700
He's doing well?

62
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,030
I have never been this happy in my life!

63
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,510
"Brook's Past! A Sad Farewell
with His Cheerful Comrade!"

64
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,810
Laboon...

65
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,590
"Rumbar Pirates
Musician & Swordsman"

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,680
Hi, everyone! I hope you're doing well.

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,870
"Brook
(50 years ago - Age: 38)"

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,740
It's morning!

69
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,580
Let's start the day with a song!

70
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,910
Eh... This week, Power
Tune will be presenting

71
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,670
the famous song, "The Black
Handkerchief of Happiness."

72
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,150
Everyone, feel free to join in!

73
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,050

83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,080
Hey, Brook. Play that one
song--ballad version.

84
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,260
Roger! That's your favorite, Captain!

85
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,970
It's a whale!

86
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,170
It's the one from yesterday...

87
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,260
You're still here? Go look for your pod!

88
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,100
Isn't it adorable?

89
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,670
Hey, how long are you gonna follow us?
I bet your mama's worried.

90
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,230
Here! Eat up, Laboon!

91
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,940
Oh, man! When did you name him?

92
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,370
We're under attack!

93
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,800
Are you two okay?

94
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,010
P-Please help us! He's severely wounded!

95
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,660
Captain, an injured man fell overboard!

96
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,230
Toss him a life preserver!
We'll save him later.

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,760
It's not like I can swim...
I guess that's all I can do.

98
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,140
You're a lifesaver, Laboon!

99
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,910
Hey, we're okay!

100
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,570
Laboon!

101
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,220
Shhh! No, no, Laboon.
Don't wake everyone up.

102
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,170
I'll sing for you when the sun rises.

103
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,140
All right! Everyone, sing that song!

104
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,930
Laboon, are you cold?

105
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,670
Treasure! We found treasure, Laboon!

106
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,390
We're gonna party today!

107
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,720
Sea monster sighting!

108
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,130
What?!

109
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
Protect Laboon!

110
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,140
Yeah!

111
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,340
We won't go easy on anyone
who picks on Laboon!

112
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,830
Yay!

113
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,940
Laboon!

114
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,650
Laboon, are you all right?

115
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,150
Thank goodness!

116
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,650
I'm so glad!

117
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,410
That's not an option, Laboon.
Please hang tight and wait here.

118
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,490
Be a good boy, okay?

119
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,170
I think like he likes you best, Brook.

120
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,090
No kidding!

121
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,050
It's because Laboon loves music!

122
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,830
Nope! The shape of your head
makes him think you're kin.

123
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,630
Huh?

124
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,090
Is that right?

125
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,180
Could you try to reason with him?

126
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,690
We tried to talk to him,

127
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,220
but he wasn't willing to listen to us.

128
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,800
You understand, don't you?

129
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,570
We aren't strong enough to
protect him from here on out.

130
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,310
He's still a child.

131
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,650
There is no way we could
take him to the Grand Line.

132
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,760
Please hear me out.

133
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,180
Now, now! The music will have to wait.

134
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,680
It's true that we're comrades,
but you're a whale and--

135
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,060
The Grand Line is dangerous! Honest!

136
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,730
Maybe you could come if you were an adult.

137
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,460
But there will be ferocious beasts unlike
anything we've seen in the West Blue!

138
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,170
Laboon, listen to--

139
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,100
Nope. He wouldn't listen to a word I said.

140
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,540
He wouldn't?

141
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,520
Maybe we should sing that song for a while.

142
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
That would have the opposite effect!

143
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,940
Captain!

144
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,710
Forget it! I know it's hard,
but avoid eye contact with him.

145
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,860
You are not allowed to sing or play your

146
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,670
instruments until Laboon leaves our ship.

147
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,530
Laboon...

148
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,650
The sails are about to rip, Captain!

149
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,600
The rudder isn't responding!

150
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,390
Keep the rudder steady! Pull up the sails!

151
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,540
We'll ride the storm!

152
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,780
The entrance to the Grand Line
awaits us on the other side!

153
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,860
Captain, there's light! Light dead ahead!

154
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,670
Look! The guiding light points
to the Grand Line's entrance.

155
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,880
Sweet!

156
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,630
Yay!

157
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,370
Captain, it's time!

158
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,540
Does anyone see Laboon?

159
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,180
No, I haven't seen hide
nor hair of him for a week.

160
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,920
I feel bad for him, but
it was for his own good.

161
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,980
With any luck, he can return to his pod.

162
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,980
Men, are you mentally ready for this?

163
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,240
Yeah! We're ready when you are!

164
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,320
Let's go to the greatest ocean in the world!

165
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,910
Yeah!

166
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,440
I am Crocus, the lighthouse keeper.

167
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,950
Congratulations on crossing Reverse Mountain.

168
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,610
Welcome to the Pirates' Graveyard.

169
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,890
Oh, ouch! Don't jinx us, man!

170
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,290
I'm the captain of the
Rumbar Pirates, Yorkie.

171
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,260
In the West Blue, I've made a bit of a
reputation for myself as "Calico" Yorkie.

172
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,220
Sorry, Crocus-san, but our ship
took a pretty bad beating...

173
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,240
You're welcome to stay as long as you like,

174
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,470
but provide my meals while you're here!

175
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,110
Dang! You want to sponge
off a bunch of pirates?

176
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,060
Okay, cool! Please celebrate with us.

177
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,320
We're going to throw a party today!

178
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,450
By the way, is the whale
that came with you a pet?

179
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,580
Geh!!

180
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,490
Laboon!

181
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,880
Laboon!

182
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:23,050
You came with us? That was--

183
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,020
Brook!

184
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,360
Laboon, thank you! This
is great! I'm so happy!

185
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,400
You're injured?! I can't believe
you braved those stormy waters!

186
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,160
That was nuts, Laboon!

187
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,540
Hey, Brook! Let's sing that song.

188
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,620
Captain, you sure love that song.

189
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,420
You bet! It's perfect for pirates!

190
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,620
Laboon, you like it too, don't you?

206
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,590
Please understand. You can't
repeat what you did last time.

207
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,210
The Grand Line is too dangerous.

208
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,590
I'm afraid that you are simply
too small to take with us!

209
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,090
Listen to me.

210
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,440
We have no idea what to
expect from here on out.

211
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,290
Now what do you think everyone would do

212
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,190
if harm should come your way?

213
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,370
We wouldn't hesitate to save you.

214
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,660
We'd try, even if that spelled
the end of the Rumbar Pirates!

215
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,690
Please understand! I'm begging you.

216
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,050
I don't want to leave you, either.

217
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,320
You don't know how hard
it was for me last time!

218
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,140
But... But...!

219
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,680
We aren't leaving him.

220
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,770
Captain!

221
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,680
Laboon! Wait for us!

222
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,450
We're going to travel straight--
just straight--across this ocean!

223
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,950
And you know what, Laboon?

224
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,430
Amazingly enough, our ship will return
to the other side of the Red Line.

225
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,240
We'll cross the wall again
and return to this cape.

226
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,550
Please wait for us!

227
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,290
You just have to hang tight
for two or three years.

228
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,300
Then you'll get to see everyone again!

229
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,760
Captain!

230
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,890
Isn't that right, Brook?

231
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,680
Yes! I swear that we will come back for you.

232
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,070
By then, you should be big and strong.

233
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,100
--Later!
--See ya, Laboon!

234
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,280
Take care!

235
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,640
Laboon, let's go on adventures
together all across the ocean!

236
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,980
We're buddies!

237
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,130
--Thank you!
--Goodbye!
--Laboon!

238
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,250
I'm so glad you understand!

239
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,560
Thank you, Laboon!

240
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:54,360
Laboon! We'll now go into the
Grand Line and travel around the world.

241
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,580
But you wait for us here.

242
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,180
"Three Years Later"

243
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:28,350
"Florian Triangle"

244
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,620
I will deliver this. I swear it!

245
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,750
It holds the song that Laboon,
the captain, and the rest of us loved!

246
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,960
I promised my crewmates
that I would take it to him.

247
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,140
It has the choral number of a lifetime

248
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,020
performed by the Rumbar Pirates,
who make crying children laugh!

249
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,630
On the next episode of One Piece!

250
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,930
"Bink's Booze! The Song that
Connects the Past with the Present!"

251
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
