00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,200
This scent... Could it be...?

3
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,290
Hey, Chopper, what's the matter?!

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,210
Hey, Chopper?!

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,130
Oops!

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,060
Hey, Chopper! Are you okay?!

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,020
Hey, are you okay?!

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,980
Are you hurt?

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,940
What on earth is going on...

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,650
Starting to run so sudden... ly...

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,360
I knew she'd be here.

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,740
--Robin!
--Robin-chan!

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,250
I won't... return to you guys.

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,920
We're parting ways here... in this town...

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,920
I carry a darkness within me
that you guys don't know about.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,550
This darkness will destroy you someday.

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,940
As a matter of fact, I'm pinning this
crime on you and planning to run away.

18
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,190
The situation will get worse.

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,530
Robin-chan! I don't get what you're saying!
What happened to you?!

20
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,280
Robin! Let's go back together!

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,200
Although I only spent a short
time with you, after today...

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,250
...I'll never see you again.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,880
Thank you for being nice to a person like me.

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,840
Goodbye.

25
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,140
Wait...

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,220
Hey... wait...

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,180
I can't...

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,390
...accept this.

29
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,310
Wait!

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,730
Stop joking!

31
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,360
Wait! Robin-chan!

32
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,530
Robin!

33
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,720
I lost sight of her.

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah.

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,220
--Chopper...
--Hm?

36
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,140
You go join Luffy and the others and tell
them everything that just happened...

37
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,270
...without leaving a single word out.

38
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,070
--What're you gonna do?
--We'll part ways here for a bit.

39
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,860
Well, don't worry. I won't do anything reckless.

40
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,790
with the sun always in our hearts

42
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

43
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,760
let's grab hold of our wishes

44
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:36,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

45
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:44,070
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

46
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:51,000
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,130
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

48
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

49
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,510
but what you cherish most will be right there

50
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,520
And if you get into a jam

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,600
I'll always be there to protect you

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,690
It's all right! Now let's move forward

53
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,280
with the sun always in our hearts

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,280
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,570
and gaze at the light beyond

56
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,500
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,750
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

58
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,750
So let's grab hold of our wishes

59
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,510
under the same flag-- together, we're one

60
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,180
One Piece

61
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:02,150
"Capture Robin!
The Determination of the Straw Hats"

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,110
--Hold it!
--Hold it right there!

63
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,870
Don't let them get away!

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,580
What's wrong with you?!

65
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,960
It was going to happen eventually!

66
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,710
With this many people, it'd be
strange if they didn't find us!

67
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,040
You can't get away from us anymore!

68
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,010
This way!

69
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,640
This way!

70
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,430
H-Huh?

71
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,520
Where'd they go?

72
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,940
Look in every nook and cranny!

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,860
What about the alleys?!

74
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,190
Couldn't they have climbed
up on some rooftop?!

75
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,230
Dammit! They shook us off?!

76
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,990
But they definitely ran in this direction!

77
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,780
Shall we check over there?!

78
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,990
Then, we'll search inside the buildings!

79
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,580
All right, then! Let's split
into two groups and search!

80
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,080
Yeah!

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,960
Is it okay now?

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,830
Not yet.

83
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,250
Where did you lose them?!

84
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,840
A bit longer.

85
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,200
Ah...

86
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,200
Please...

87
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,290
Come back some other time!
I'm evacuating now. Stop pestering me!

88
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,300
Please... I've got money.

89
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,260
As much lumber, tar, and rope
as this amount will buy...

90
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,720
Also, some nails, latches, and tinplates...

91
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,850
I'm closing the shop.

92
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,350
Ah... I'm sorry, but...

93
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,610
Tsk... Okay, then.

94
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,150
But you can't buy that much
with this little money.

95
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,280
Th-Then, to make up for the rest,
I'd like to exchange my tools.

96
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,120
Hey, hey, don't be ridiculous! Stop it!

97
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,870
I only sell. To think you're tryin' to barter...
What are you, a bumpkin?

98
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,260
Geez... You win.

99
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,020
H-Hey! Are you okay carrying that
stuff when you're injured that badly?

100
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,980
Surely you have friends, right?! Hey!

101
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,860
See, what did I tell you?

102
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,460
Hey, hold on a sec, lad!

103
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,380
I'm okay. This is nothing.

104
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,300
--Hey!
--What is it? Are you gonna...

105
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,220
No...

106
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,180
Here. Take these. You're hungry, right?

107
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,190
Thank you.

108
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,860
Sure... Be careful going back.

109
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Be careful going back!

110
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,090
These're good.

111
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,050
These're really good.

112
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,880
What a considerate pops he was.

113
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,730
The waves are getting quite high.

114
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,330
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

115
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,840
You're a ship... that flew in the sky!

116
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,050
Don't worry!

117
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,560
What's the matter, all of a sudden?

118
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,670
What's wrong, Franky?

119
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,760
Bro?

120
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,850
I'm getting ticked off!

121
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,520
Maybe it's about time to
go on another rampage!

122
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,770
Bro! Wait for us!

123
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,940
Thanks for the drink, Blueno!

124
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,570
What happened to Franky
all of a sudden, Kokoro-san?

125
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:53,090
Beats me... How should
I know... how idiots think?

126
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,060
I guess things have finally calmed down.

127
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,180
"Finally calmed down"?!

128
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,350
You had all those shipwrights chasing after you!

129
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,070
That's why we ended up
getting dragged into it, too!

130
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,570
I said it was unavoidable, didn't I?

131
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,530
At any rate, Chopper, I'm surprised
you found out where we were.

132
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,330
--Your scent.
--Oh, yeah.

133
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,990
Hm? Come to think of it, where's Sanji?

134
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,040
Well...

135
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,930
Did Robin really say that?!

136
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,850
Yeah.

137
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,280
We all... were prepared for it, right?

138
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,410
Even though it was for a
short time, we let Robin,

139
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,910
who showed up as an enemy, come on board.

140
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,120
It'd be embarrassing if we ran
away because we got scared.

141
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,750
Isn't it about time for us to settle this matter...

142
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,800
...as to whether that woman is... foe or friend?

143
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,400
The situation will get worse.

144
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,860
After today... I'll never see you again.

145
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,580
So you're sure that Robin said that, Chopper?

146
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,540
Yeah.

147
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,420
She said she wouldn't see us after today.

148
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,250
It also sounds like she's
declaring that she'll do something

149
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,880
that could worsen the situation
before the day is over.

150
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,260
Look at how big a fuss

151
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,480
the attempted assassination of
the mayor caused in this town.

152
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,560
If it's possible to make the situation worse,

153
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,860
there's only one thing she can do.

154
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,320
This time for sure... Assassinate the mayor...

155
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,530
It's natural to think that way.

156
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,750
But we know that she's pinning
her crime on us on purpose,

157
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,000
so it's possible that this could be a trap
to lure us out to the scene of the crime.

158
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,500
Trap...

159
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,000
If we're at the spot of the
assassination carried out tonight,

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,050
the crime will easily be pinned on us.

161
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,180
Hey! You already sound
like Robin is really our foe!

162
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,270
I'm talking about the possibility.

163
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,560
It's not that I've decided on either.

164
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,190
If I already decide either to believe her or not,

165
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,730
if the truth turns out to
be the opposite of that...

166
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,450
...it'll slow down my reaction.

167
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,950
If something is to happen,
it'll be tonight. Are we going?

168
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,910
We are.

169
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,010
I don't mind going... but there's a problem.

170
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,100
Sanji-kun saw Robin walking
with someone, right?

171
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,230
Iceberg-san said the same thing.
She was with someone with a mask on.

172
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,570
"Mr. Iceberg Falls Victim to Assassin"

173
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,110
But it wasn't any of us.

174
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,820
He must be the reason why
Robin suddenly changed.

175
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,280
Isn't he making Robin do bad things?!

176
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,620
That would be fortune.

177
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,000
If this guy is Robin's real friend,
then that would be misfortune.

178
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,250
But "someone with a mask on"
can't be a clue. That's the problem.

179
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,130
What's our goal?

180
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,590
We'll capture Robin.

181
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,270
Otherwise, we won't know anything.

182
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,770
True. Thinking about it is a waste of time.

183
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,900
But, come to think of it...

184
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,650
...the World Government has been trying
to capture that woman for twenty years,

185
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,860
and yet, it still hasn't happened.

186
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,080
But if we wanna know the truth,
that's the only way.

187
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,080
Okay, I'll do my best, too!

188
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,120
Well then, let's go...

189
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,130
...to Galley-La Company!

190
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,590
Dammit! The night is coming at last.

191
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,310
Paulie-san! This is it! The backstreets
will become dangerous soon.

192
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,390
Yeah. Let's go back.

193
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,560
I'm gonna head to the main office.

194
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,190
Okay!

195
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,820
Hey, guys! We're going back!

196
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,320
Straw Hat! Show yourself!

197
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,820
Where're you hiding?!

198
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,240
Straw Hat! That bastard...!

199
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,710
I thought the guy had at least a bit of mettle.

200
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,790
But he doesn't even show himself.

201
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,630
But Bro, the entire island holds
a grudge against them right now.

202
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,050
She's right. They must be
running from place to place.

203
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,680
By the way, what's the matter?
What're you guys doing?

204
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,100
We're vulnerable to strong winds from the front.

205
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,190
More importantly, Bro, the way you're
raging today is different from usual.

206
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,780
Letting stuff build up inside you isn't like you.

207
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,820
Shut up! I'm like that this week!

208
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,490
--Bro!
--Hm?

209
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,450
--Bro! Bro!
--That's Zambai and the others.

210
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,370
Bro! Did you beat up those bastards?

211
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,750
No, not yet.

212
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,590
There was some crazy
interference. They got away.

213
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,710
What?!

214
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,260
They got away from you when you were angry?!

215
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,920
What strong luck they have!

216
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:21,260
I see... Since that weak long-nosed guy
was fixing their ship all by himself,

217
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,930
I just assumed that you beat up the others.

218
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,150
Huh? You found one of them?!

219
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,230
Y... Yes, on their ship.

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,860
If you've found one of them, that makes it easy.

221
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,120
We can use him to drag them all out!

222
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,370
B-Bro is showing his bad guy face.

223
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,250
Well then, you guys! Starting now,
march throughout the town...

224
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,090
...shouting, "We've got Long-nose!

225
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,090
If you don't want him to sink in the sea,

226
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,630
come to the warehouse under the bridge!

227
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,100
Franky sends his regards!"

228
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,390
To make it true, I'm gonna
go kidnap Long-nose.

229
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,360
Okay, Bro! Leave it to us!

230
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,130
You're big, but your baggage is big, too, huh?

231
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,380
This is my special bed.

232
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,590
Aqua Laguna! Aqua Laguna!

233
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,640
Aqua Laguna is coming!

234
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,180
We're Aqua Laguna!

235
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,350
Run!

236
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,560
So what's going on with those culprits?

237
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,150
I heard that they haven't been caught after all.

238
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,360
How disturbing. Ahh, what a pain...

239
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,580
It's said that they might attack again
tonight in the confusion of the storm.

240
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,330
Aqua Laguna is here!

241
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,830
But it'll be crazy tonight.

242
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,040
I heard that all the craftsmen
will be guarding the main office.

243
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,550
Whoa! That's pretty serious!

244
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,170
How many are there in the Straw Hat Pirates?

245
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,010
Some people said 50. Others said 100.

246
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,850
The captain's got a 100 million
bounty on his head, after all.

247
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,100
Some said that 3,000 of his men
would advance from the sea!

248
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,230
That sounds totally dangerous!

249
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,620
Galley-La Company! Form a line,
and don't leave any openings!

250
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,240
Yeah!

251
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,870
Don't allow even a single rat inside!

252
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,540
Yeah!

253
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,140
Bring it on!

254
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,060
Shut up, coo coo! Be quiet, Tilestone!

255
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,020
I was told that they weren't on the sea train.

256
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,030
Then they're still somewhere
on this island, huh?

257
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,950
But they're fools if they really
appear with all these guards around.

258
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,910
I heard that an idiot plunged in here
in the middle of the day today.

259
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,500
Don't think using your common sense.

260
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,170
Well...

261
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,630
They don't have to go this far.

262
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,550
They're doing it voluntarily.

263
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,800
They're treating me like a king.

264
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,010
By the way, why did you put up Nico
Robin's wanted poster in your room?

265
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,100
Are you curious?

266
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,020
A little.

267
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,400
It's better if you don't know.

268
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,530
She is... a devil.

269
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,310
Tons of people are guarding the place.

270
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,310
It's a little far.

271
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,480
You can just stretch your arm
and go flying there, right?

272
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
But after the commotion starts, okay?

273
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:48,200
Yeah. If we cause a commotion before
they do, they'll just take advantage of it.

274
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,030
Listen up!

275
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,160
Don't miss even the slightest movement!

276
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,410
Yeah!

277
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

278
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

279
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

280
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

281
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

282
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

283
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

284
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

285
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

286
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

287
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

288
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

289
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

290
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

291
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

292
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

293
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

294
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,750
What was that explosion?!

295
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,420
So they've finally started taking action.

296
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,180
The craftsmen are being
attacked by weird people!

297
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,300
Robin is definitely in that commotion.

298
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,930
Listen. Think that we'll never be able to
see Robin again if we miss this chance!

299
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,390
I know. We'll definitely
capture her. Just wait, Robin!

300
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

301
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,520
"Cannon Fire Is the Signal!
CP9 Goes into Action"

302
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,990
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
