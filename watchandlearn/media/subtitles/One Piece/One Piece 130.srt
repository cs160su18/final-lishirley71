00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,040
I...

20
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,090
I will remain here...

21
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,600
...but if we ever meet again some day...

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,350
...will you call me your friend again?!

23
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,540
"Scent Of Danger!
The Seventh Member is Nico Robin!"

24
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,850
Yes... We sank one ship...

25
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,540
...just one ship belonging to some
"Bon Clay," a Baroque Works agent.

26
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,950
The other ship was...

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,130
Hey, get a move on.

28
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,050
So you let them get away...

29
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,420
To think that I fell for such a cheap trick...

30
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,450
They're good at running away.

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,850
Miss Hina! Watch out!

32
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,140
Seriously, it makes me angry. I'm going mad!

33
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,890
Angry at your shiftlessness?

34
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,230
No, that's not it.

35
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,160
Whoa! It gives me the tingles!
The power of Cage Cage Fruit!

36
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,860
"Everything that touches
my body will be locked up."

37
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,570
Say it! Say the killer line! Please say it!

38
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,790
What the hell is this?! An iron lock?!

39
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,630
I'm angry at you, Smoker-kun.

40
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,630
That rings too many bells...

41
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,990
Because... you seem to be quite
happy about Straw Hat getting away.

42
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,550
Huh...?

43
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,260
Me? Why would I be?

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,660
Who knows...?

45
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,720
And she said in a formal way,

46
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,060
"I have something important to talk
with you about, Daddy-- no, Father..."

47
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,910
As the King of this country, I thought...

48
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,620
"It's also hard to give up
on being called Daddy."

49
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,400
Hey, what're you saying?!

50
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,690
I cannot accept your death...

51
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,480
I cannot even shed tears...

52
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,630
I wonder why... Pell...

53
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,210
Fire! Fire!

54
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,650
What is it, Toto-san? You've been
laughing ever since the speech.

55
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,760
Geez... Were you hit by
a sandstorm, old man?

56
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,060
It's a secret. I won't tell you guys what it is.

57
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,220
Huh? What's that about...?

58
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,280
Take care, Luffy-kun! Come back
some time to drink Yuba's water.

59
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,130
Huh?

60
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,700
Now, what're you guys doing?
Dig the well! Dig!

61
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,230
Okay, okay...

62
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,930
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

63
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:27,340
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

64
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,400
before someone else could beat me to it

65
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:47,390
Every day is now covered with dust

66
00:06:47,390 --> 00:07:03,100
All I can do is yield
everything to the time one day

67
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,470
If the world is going to change

68
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,440
Say... At any rate, who was
the princess talking to?

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,270
Who knows and who cares?!

70
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:20,910
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

71
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,820
What Vivi-sama said makes us happy.

72
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,430
We have to respond to it!

73
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,320
Yeah, that's right.

74
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Though we're nobodies.

75
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,900
We don't wanna hear it from you!

76
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:31,630
so that my memories won't fade

77
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,220
As expected, Alubarna
seems to be in bad shape.

78
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,240
Then let us go there.

79
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,600
But we also have to restore Yuba quickly,

80
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,960
as it's an important crossroad in the west.

81
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,150
We also have to repair all the
canals along the Sandora River.

82
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,720
Hm? What about the casino?

83
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,920
It'll be closed. Let's go, everyone!

84
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Yeah!

85
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,470
So, why're we giving him special treatment?

86
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,810
I don't know... Vivi-sama
told us to. What can we do?

87
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,500
On top of that, I heard that he wants
to join the Supersonic Duck Squadron.

88
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,270
He's a camel...

89
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,880
Yeah, he's a camel, isn't he...?

90
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,220
Well then... Thank you... for everything.

91
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,810
Seriously, you're such a hasty one.

92
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,470
Normally, with those injuries, I wouldn't
even allow you to move around.

93
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,520
Yeah. See you, then.

94
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,520
You have to take a long rest
once you get home! You got that?

95
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,850
Yeah, I get it.

96
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,300
Ahh... Hey, wait.

97
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,100
You forgot this. Here.

98
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,990
Ah... Thanks.

99
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,120
In any case, stay put and rest. Okay?

100
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,160
Let the others handle your work.

101
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,490
Oh, and, eat nutritious meals that are
easy on the stomach. Don't skip meals...

102
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,810
Uhm... I'll be fine, so...

103
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,760
Whoa! They're fast!

104
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,590
Rather, our ship is slowing down!

105
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,050
Water's flooding in from the holes.
We can't make it all the way out like this.

106
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,020
Hey, Chopper! Do you still have
more panels? We'll be in trouble soon...

107
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,100
Chopper!

108
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,410
Three ships!

109
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,800
We have no choice but to fight, huh?

110
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,280
Alright! Let's go!

111
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,080
What's this?!

112
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,250
Oh, that?

113
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Usopp said to keep them since we might
be able to use them for something.

114
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
--They're in our way!
--We don't need them!

115
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,080
Then should we ditch them?

116
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
Everyone, take your positions! Once we
pull up, we'll make an all-out attack!

117
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,750
Okay! Are we ready?!

118
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,490
Huh?

119
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,090
Now is the chance. Let's go full
speed ahead and shake them off!

120
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,180
Now, Karoo!

121
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,560
Let's go back... to Alubarna!

122
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,120
Although my adventure is over,

123
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,490
a new challenge, restoring Alabasta,
is waiting for me this time.

124
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,570
Right now Alabasta is like a small,
beat-up ship wandering on the sea...

125
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,380
But no matter how big a wave we face,
we'll never be discouraged...

126
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,680
We'll push forward, without losing our path...

127
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,350
...facing straight ahead... vigorously...!

128
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,660
That's right... just like
that wondrous, small ship...

129
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,210
We'll definitely be able to see them
again some day, right, Karoo?!

130
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,690
Smoker-san...

131
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,450
Hey, young lady. Are your legs okay now?

132
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,630
P... Please stop talking like that.

133
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,420
Thank you...

134
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,850
I saw their new bounties...

135
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,570
For them, these numbers are no surprise.

136
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,880
Do you know what his
swordsman buddy did?

137
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,310
You mean Roronoa?

138
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,010
He slew 100 bounty
hunters in Whisky Peak.

139
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,100
In addition, he cut down
Daz Bonez in Alubarna.

140
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,570
Daz...?! That assassin?!

141
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,730
He used to be a bounty hunter and
was also called that in the West Blue,

142
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,460
but he went under the name
of Mr. 1 in Baroque Works.

143
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,330
Well, considering Crocodile had
so many famous guys under him,

144
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,440
we should be impressed...

145
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,770
...but they lost...

146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,670
We'll have a rematch with
the Straw Hats some other time.

147
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,100
Yes!

148
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,970
Looks like the Navy
has stopped following us.

149
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,010
--Hmm...
--Hmm...
--Hmm...

150
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,990
--We did shake them off, right?!
--Hmm...

151
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,360
--Hmm...
--Hmm...

152
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,800
Hmm...

153
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,620
You know... What's with
those indifferent replies...?

154
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
I miss her!

155
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,910
Don't be whiny!

156
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,310
If you wanted her to stay with us that badly,

157
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,490
you should've taken her by force!

158
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,360
Ahh! You're such a savage!

159
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,440
You're the worst!

160
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,540
Moss head.

161
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,600
Three-Sword Style...

162
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,660
Hey, wait, Luffy.
"Three-Sword Style" isn't an insult.

163
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,000
Four-Sword Style.

164
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
The number isn't exactly the problem...

165
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,640
Listen. You know natto, right?

166
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,180
Even if you call natto rotten, it wouldn't...

167
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,490
Looks like we finally
made it off of the island!

168
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,420
Yeah.

169
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,520
Good job.

170
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,480
Here to avenge your
organization?! I'll take you on!

171
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,630
Why are you here?!

172
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,820
Enemy attack...! Enemy attack...!

173
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,030
Who's she?

174
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,360
Who cares?! She's that beautiful lady!

175
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,480
Didn't I tell you before not to point
such dangerous objects at me?

176
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,440
How long have you been on this ship?!

177
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,710
All this time...

178
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,840
These're your clothes, right?
I'm borrowing them.

179
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,640
What're you trying to do, Baroque Works?!

180
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,850
Monkey D. Luffy...

181
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,680
You haven't forgotten what
you did to me, have you?

182
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,590
Luffy! What'd you do to that
beautiful lady, you bastard?!

183
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,610
--Get off the ship immediately.
--I'm asking you what you did to her!

184
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,740
Hey, you! Don't lie!
I didn't do anything to you!

185
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,550
Yes, you did. What you did
to me was unbearable.

186
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,870
Take responsibility.

187
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,190
--Who's that and what's going on?
--What's this "unbearable"
thing you did, Luffy?!

188
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,080
--Leave the ship... or we'll
call the Navy. I'm serious.
--You'd better take responsibility or...!

189
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,880
You don't make sense!
What do you want me to do?!

190
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,340
Let me... join your crew.

191
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
What?!

192
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,640
Use that immediately. It can neutralize
the poison from Crocodile's hook.

193
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,680
Even if he's buried in this rubble,
he might survive since he's a rubber man.

194
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,530
You said that time that history
is the only thing written here...

195
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,200
Why did you lie?

196
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,760
So you knew...? How mean...

197
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,050
This country's history isn't written in there.

198
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,630
Everything about the weapon you
wanted must've been written there.

199
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,970
Of course, its location, too...

200
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,420
If you had told Crocodile about it,

201
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,660
the country would've become his
at that point. Isn't that right?

202
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,150
I'm not interested in such things.

203
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,150
Whether the country and people
live or die, I don't really care.

204
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,610
I wasn't going to give the weapon
to Crocodile from the start.

205
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,580
I don't get it... Then why did you come here?

206
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,660
What one expects and what
one hopes are different things.

207
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,540
What I was seeking was the Rio Poneglyph.

208
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,790
The only "stone that tells the
real history" among the Poneglyphs

209
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,470
that are scattered throughout the world.

210
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,340
That's the Rio Poneglyph...

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,310
What do you mean by the "real history"?

212
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,600
I give up... I've searched for it
for 20 years and I'm out of clues...

213
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,300
This place was my last hope... and a failure...

214
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,300
Dying here like this would
be a fitting end for me...

215
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,510
Living like this has exhausted me...

216
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,140
All I want is to learn the history...

217
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,780
...but there're too many enemies...
to achieve my dream...

218
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,590
Let me ask you a question...

219
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,950
By any chance... can the
untold history be uncovered?

220
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,810
Are you saying that the
Poneglyphs hold that record?

221
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,820
Then why do we...

222
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,170
Okay, let's go up.

223
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,070
Wait a second! I no longer
have a reason to live!

224
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,780
Leave me here!

225
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,750
Why do I have to listen to you?

226
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,720
What?

227
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,220
You made me live then when I
wanted to die. That's your crime.

228
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,180
There's no place for me to go or go back to.

229
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,730
So let me stay on this ship.

230
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,250
Oh, I see... Then I guess
we have no choice... Okay.

231
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,770
Luffy!

232
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,190
Don't worry. She isn't a bad person.

233
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,360
Mellorine! Mellor--!

234
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,630
Pay attention!

235
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,670
Answer my questions honestly!

236
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,370
I'll ask you one more time.
What's your name?!

237
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,360
Ah... I'm Usopp. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, nice to meet you.

238
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,810
My name is Nico Robin.

239
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,800
Okay, then, Nico Robin.
What's your occupation?

240
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,970
An archaeologist.

241
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,980
An archaeologist?!

242
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,230
I come from a long line of archaeologists.

243
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,140
Hmm... I see... That kind of family, huh?

244
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,420
What the hell...?

245
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,990
And?

246
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,520
I became an archaeologist,
and then a wanted criminal.

247
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,990
That was when I was eight.

248
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,500
Since then, I've spent the past
20 years hiding from the world.

249
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,840
Since you were eight...?
By yourself all this time?

250
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,510
But then, there was no way for a child
to be able to survive alone on the sea.

251
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,430
So, in the end, in order to protect
myself and in order to achieve my goal,

252
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,360
I've chosen to follow various rogues...
So that's how it was.

253
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,400
So does that mean that Crocodile
was just another rogue to you?

254
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,890
Yeah, I guess... in order to get
closer to the Rio Poneglyph...

255
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,300
Rio...?

256
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,260
Thanks to that, I've become good
at doing things behind the scenes.

257
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,540
I'm sure I'll be able to help you guys, too.

258
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,410
Oh...? You're full of confidence.

259
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,130
What're you good at?

260
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,380
Assassination.

261
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Luffy! This investigation has
concluded that she's too dangerous!

262
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,510
Are you guys listening?!

263
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,930
Seriously...!

264
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,760
Being dealt with so easily... How pathetic!

265
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,100
She was the vice president of a
crime syndicate until just recently.

266
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,820
How are we gonna let such a woman join us?

267
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,260
Even if you could deceive idiots,
you can't deceive me!

268
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,740
If you pull any weird stunts, I'll kick you out!

269
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,540
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

270
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,400
I just remembered...

271
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,580
I brought some of
Crocodile's jewelry with me...

272
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,200
Wow! I love you, sister!

273
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

274
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,460
Nami's been suckered.

275
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,910
That's an evil trick.

276
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,300
She's completely following
that woman's lead.

277
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,280
Oh, love... Floating love...

278
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,100
I'm driftwood that just lays its
burnt-to-a-crisp body in that stream...

279
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,940
Treasure...

280
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,670
I'm driftwood that has been struck
by the thunderbolt that is your beauty

281
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,800
and caught in a raging torrent...

282
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,360
Snack for you.

283
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,620
Oh, thank you.

284
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,810
And his reaction is no surprise.

285
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,340
Yeah... We just have to consider that
he was a lost cause from the start...

286
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,780
In any case... now that it's come to this,
the two of us are the last holdouts.

287
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,640
Indeed, they're so simple-minded,
or should I say lax.

288
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,510
Hey, Usopp!

289
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,090
Hm?!

290
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,890
Chopper.

291
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,580
Should I call you "Robin-chan"?
Or should it be "Robin-san"...?

292
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,320
Which should it be?

293
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,400
Oh? Where're you going?

294
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,620
Oh... she's great...

295
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,360
She's got an adult charm,
which is different from Nami-san's...

296
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,940
This ship is nice...
Is it always lively like this?

297
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,510
Yeah... It is.

298
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,930
I see...

299
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,680
What is that woman up to...?

300
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,970
By the way, Navigator...
Is it smooth sailing right now?

301
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,010
Wind, weather... Both no problem!
It's going very smoothly, Sis!

302
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,400
You definitely got jewelry
from her, didn't you?!

303
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,620
Sanji! Isn't our snack ready?

304
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,900
Just hold on a sec!

305
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,340
I'm hungry!

306
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,830
Me too! Me too! Me too!

307
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,420
My grave...

308
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:27,450
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

309
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:33,410
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

310
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:39,620
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

311
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,090
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

312
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,300
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

313
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,770
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

314
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

315
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,270
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

316
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,530
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

317
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,600
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

318
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,540
A never-ending journey to be together

319
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,130
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

320
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,560
We can see an island!

321
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,010
Alright! Let's explore it!

322
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,730
First, we'll go look for food! We'll decide
who's gonna watch the ship with this.

323
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,390
Oh, it'll be Chopper. Okay then,
please look after the ship.

324
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,300
Everyone! Be careful!

325
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,310
I'm all by myself today. I wonder
how Doctorine is doing now...

326
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

327
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
"The First Patient!
The Untold Story of the Rumble Ball"

328
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
