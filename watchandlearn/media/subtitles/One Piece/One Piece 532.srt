Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,020
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

76
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,150
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training.

77
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,030
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

78
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,910
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level.

79
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:52,750
However, there they found the New Fish-Man
Pirates disturbing the peace and order.

80
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,510
What's wrong with you?

81
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,180
Who are you, sir?!

82
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,360
What?! It was a big
person... I mean, Mermaid!

83
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,450
Somebody! Father-sama! Brother-sama!

84
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,290
Whoa, whoa! I didn't do
anything to you, did I?!

85
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,590
Oh, damn! What's with you?!

86
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:49,640
"A Coward and a Crybaby!
The Princess in the Hard Shell Tower!"

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,690
Hey!

88
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,400
Keep lighting up!

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,070
How many times do I have to tell you?

90
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,030
A CREW MEMBER OF THE FLYING PIRATES
WADATSUMI, THE GREAT MONK

91
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,030
It's not time for playing!

92
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,160
A snack!

93
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,540
Wadatsumi!

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,960
Didn't you get a reply yet?
A reply from Princess Shirahoshi?

95
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,260
No, not yet, Captain Decken.

96
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,220
How long have I been waiting for it?

97
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,390
For 10 years or so. And it hasn't come yet.

98
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,650
It's all because of that hateful Neptune!

99
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,360
He wants to plunge Princess
Shirahoshi into a political marriage!

100
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
I suspect!

101
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,080
In fact, the Princess has been locked
up in the steel tower for 10 years!

102
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,250
Oh, how painful this is!

103
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,790
Because we love each other!

104
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,880
I suspect!

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,430
THE CAPTAIN OF THE FLYING PIRATES
VANDER DECKEN IX

106
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,720
Princess Shirahoshi! I love you!

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,850
I love you! I love you!

108
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,020
I love you!

109
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,060
No matter how much I roam this vast seafloor,

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,320
I can't find someone who is as
big and beautiful as you are!

111
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,450
It's fine if we end up together.

112
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,540
But I can't allow you to
live with somebody else!

113
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,870
I'd rather see you dead than
with someone else, Shirahoshi!

114
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,800
Your life is either dead or marriage!

115
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,090
Let me present you with an ax with a
rose painted on it just as always!

116
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:57,220
Accept it, Shirahoshi!
As proof of our marriage!

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,100
Captain? It's way off the target.

118
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,650
Don't be silly! I don't miss!

119
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,860
I suspect.

120
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,780
It's coming back!

121
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
It's heading towards the Ryugu Palace!

122
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,710
THE ROYAL PALACE OF THE RYUGU KINGDOM
THE RYUGU PALACE

123
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,210
Hey, hey, whoa! What's going on?

124
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,090
I'm just a pirate who came
here looking for food!

125
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,590
Listen to me!

126
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,510
Hey!

127
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,600
She's loud! What should I do?

128
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Princess Shirahoshi-sama's crying!

129
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,900
--It's from the Hard Shell Tower!
--What are the tower guards doing?!

130
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,730
What?! Why is nobody with her?!

131
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm sorry! The guard shifts were changing!

132
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,360
In any case, get to the tower now!

133
00:07:52,360 --> 00:08:00,080
A human is... here in the
room... trying to kill me!

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,710
Huh? No! Hey! That's not true!

135
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,590
I was hungry and I didn't
know that the food was yours!

136
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,780
What's that ax?! Where did it come from?!

137
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,790
THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE RYUGU PALACE

138
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,790
Oh, boy!

139
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,000
When can we have a banquet?
How long do we have to wait?

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,550
My stomach is growling...

141
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,170
But I don't have a stomach to growl!

142
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,140
--Hey!
--Yes?

143
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,890
It doesn't look like we're
having a banquet any time soon!

144
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,100
Does this mean that we've
landed ourselves in trouble?

145
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
What should we do?!

146
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm sorry that you came all the way
here but we've just received a call!

147
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,490
You Straw Hat people, you are suspects
in 2 ongoing investigations.

148
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,120
S-Suspects?! What do you mean?!

149
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,160
First, for multiple counts
of Mermaid kidnapping!

150
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,210
We didn't do such...

151
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,920
Second, you people are suspected
of being a potential risk...

152
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,670
...to the Fish-Man Island due to
Madam Sharley's prevision!

153
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,600
Huh? Prevision? You don't know
if that'll happen for real!

154
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,720
--Shut up!
--What's wrong with them?!

155
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,100
Is this the right thing to do?

156
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,480
Therefore, we're here to
take you people into custody!

157
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,690
Catch them at any cost!
We have to protect the Fish-Man Island!

158
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,030
Yeah!

159
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,860
Go!

160
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,570
Princess Shirahoshi-sama!

161
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,200
Somebody's coming!

162
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,210
I'm sorry to do this!

163
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,830
--Are you alright?
--Did you get hurt?

164
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,420
N-No!

165
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,260
You were crying louder
than usual - we were worried!

166
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,220
What are you...?!

167
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,800
Who opened this door?!

168
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,850
Was it an intruder?

169
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,850
I-I'm sorry to make you worry!

170
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,810
I think I had a bad dream...

171
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,560
Hey...!

172
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,020
--No, I heard somebody for sure!
--No, that's... Um... Well...

173
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,900
My stomach made a noise!

174
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,990
A-Are you sure?

175
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,400
Who is it?!

176
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,530
Megalo! Welcome home!

177
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,830
Oh yes! There is something
that I have to tell you.

178
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,050
It's about Straw Hat Luffy,
the pirate who saved Megalo.

179
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,390
He is suspected in the kidnapping
of some missing Mermaid girls.

180
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,470
And due to Madam Sharley's prediction,

181
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,980
all of the Straw Hats are considered
as an uncertain but potential risk

182
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,060
so we've decided to lock
them in the palace prison.

183
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,570
We took the swordsman who
came to the palace first

184
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,360
into custody while he was
sleeping due to intoxication.

185
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:29,040
The 3 members who just arrived are
probably in custody by now, too.

186
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,750
But their captain--Straw Hat, who was with
them, might have noticed our intentions

187
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,840
and ran away.

188
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,130
He is probably hiding somewhere
in the palace so please be careful.

189
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,180
We'll catch the rest of them on the island

190
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,060
and defend the country at any cost.

191
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,150
--I just heard something.
--Did you? Isn't it just your imagination?

192
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,780
--No, I'm sure I...
--No, it's just your imagination!

193
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,740
Okay. Anyway,

194
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,870
I feel bad that we have to arrest the
people who saved Megalo's life!

195
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,160
Princess-sama,
you're acting strangely. Are you hiding...

196
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,460
Minister of the Right, we have to go.

197
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, it's been 5 minutes already.
We're gonna go now.

198
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,430
Lock the doors tightly!

199
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,810
Thank you very much!

200
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,860
I was being very rude to you
before. Please forgive me!

201
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,620
I didn't know that you were the
one who saved Megalo's life.

202
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,580
May I call you Luffy-sama?

203
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,160
Uh-huh.

204
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,090
Luffy-sama, you are a pirate does
that mean you are a bad person?

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,010
I don't know. You decide.

206
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,760
Okay.

207
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,140
Oh, they said that our soldiers
took your friends into custody...

208
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,480
Yeah but that's fine. You guys can't
keep them under control anyway.

209
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,770
Is that so?

210
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,860
Don't worry about it.
Now tell me, what was that ax?

211
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,700
Who threw it? From where?

212
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,580
I know who did it...

213
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,660
His name is Vander Decken-sama.

214
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,290
He holds a grudge against
me for refusing to marry him.

215
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:48,180
That gentleman has a Devil's
power called Mark-Mark.

216
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,600
He can strike me anytime or
anywhere with a thrown weapon

217
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,100
since he designated me as his mark.

218
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:13,080
That's why it's too dangerous for
me to leave this Hard Shell Tower...

219
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm hungry!

220
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,930
Yum-yum! Can I eat this?

221
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,980
Go ahead.

222
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,520
Yummy!

223
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:50,200
He wants to marry you but
he's trying to kill you?

224
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,820
It doesn't make sense, does it?

225
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,780
It's been 10 years already.

226
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,330
For 10 years?! You must be bored!

227
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:06,000
On top of that, my father made a rule that
soldiers can't stay here more than 5 minutes.

228
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,960
Hmmm.

229
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,720
That's why Megalo is the
only one that I can talk to.

230
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,010
He's my dear friend.

231
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,810
That's why they wanted
to have a banquet for us.

232
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,770
It must be canceled now.

233
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:29,360
I wonder why they want to put
Megalo's liberators in prison.

234
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:37,490
I heard that Madam Sharley-sama's
previsions are unbelievably accurate.

235
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,330
That explains why everyone's afraid, but...

236
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:51,010
Anyway, you humans eat a lot
even though you're small!

237
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,140
That hairy old man said... that we
were gonna have a banquet, but...

238
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,270
he kept getting scolded...

239
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,060
so I couldn't wait any longer...
and I followed the smell.

240
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,110
By the way, did they call you Princess?

241
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,530
Yes.

242
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,400
Are you the Mermaid Princess?

243
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,200
Yes. I am King Neptune's daughter.

244
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,820
My name is Shirahoshi.

245
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,290
--Shirasu (Baby sardine)?
--Shirahoshi.

246
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,790
Hmmm. That's hard to pronounce.

247
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, I wanna eat that too!

248
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,710
I don't think you're such a bad person.

249
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,630
Do you seek adventures since you're a pirate?

250
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,640
Uh-huh.

251
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,310
Oh yeah! Have you ever seen the sun?

252
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,140
There are stars in the
night sky, aren't there?

253
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,980
And there are different kinds
of flowers and hairy animals!

254
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,030
Have you ever been to a green
place called a "forest"?

255
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,200
Wait, wait! That's too many
questions! Wait a moment!

256
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,700
Okay!

257
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,160
Oh, that's a big cheek pouch!

258
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,290
Push!

259
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,960
Stop it! What are you doing?!

260
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,800
P-P-Please...

261
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,890
Don't yell at me like that!

262
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,560
Luffy-sama is a scary
man just as I thought...

263
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,110
Whoa, whoa! I didn't do
anything to make you cry! Stop!

264
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,150
I have never been yelled
at by anyone before...

265
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,700
You may be big but you're
a coward and a crybaby!

266
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,790
I don't like you!

267
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,700
What?!

268
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,840
No one ever said such a
horrible thing to me...

269
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,840
How awful you are! Please leave now!

270
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,890
I can't take it anymore!

271
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,020
I'm full! Thank you for the food!

272
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,810
So you've been here for 10 years, huh?
It could make you sick!

273
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,860
Luffy-sama, please leave now!

274
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,570
Hey, isn't there anywhere you wanna go?

275
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,700
Huh?

276
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,240
Of course, there are a lot
of places that I want to go...

277
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,710
That's what I thought.
Then let's get out of here!

278
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,670
What?

279
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,290
Let's go for a walk!

280
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,340
No... No, I'm not supposed to do that!

281
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,960
Why? Let's go!

282
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,760
--You're gonna be okay!
--Huh?

283
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,930
If something's thrown at
you again, I'll deflect it!

284
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,190
Boy! How can he sleep under
these circumstances?

285
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,900
He was drinking like crazy so...

286
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,400
--Hurry up!
--Yes, sir!

287
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,280
A lot of activity in the palace.
What's going on?

288
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,960
Usopp-chin! Nami-chin! Brook-chin!

289
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,260
Catch them!

290
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,970
They're just 3 humans!

291
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,590
What're you gonna do?!

292
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,140
Guys! If you resist more,
you're really gonna become criminals!

293
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,810
But there is no reason for
us to obey them, Camie-san.

294
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,690
I was looking forward to a
banquet at the Ryugu Palace.

295
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,650
They'll just arrest us if we don't resist!

296
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,910
They made an unthinkable
accusation against us first!

297
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,280
We will fight them forever
if that's what they want!

298
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,370
--They're so strong even without the captain!
--Can't believe it!

299
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,920
I don't know what we're
gonna do in the future.

300
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,220
But you can't arrest us now
for things we haven't done!

301
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,300
The nose guy wasn't ever
that remarkable, was he?!

302
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,470
Brook-chin and Nami-chin became
stronger than 2 years ago as well!

303
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,770
See? That's the prologue to the
future that has been predicted.

304
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:18,900
Yeah, right! If you guys didn't start it,
we wouldn't have to fight back in the first place!

305
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,780
He's right.

306
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,950
But this is nothing compared to giant
insects' all-out attack on the Bowin Islands!

307
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,250
Witness the power of my
new weapon - Black Kabuto!

308
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,130
Bring it on!

309
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,880
Neptune-sama, we need your help!

310
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,930
I wonder if it's fair to arrest
somebody based on a prediction.

311
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,480
I need some time to think-jamon!

312
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,560
Thus,

313
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,820
you need to be in custody for now!

314
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,610
He's formidable!

315
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,780
Take this!

316
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,790
Zoro!

317
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,000
I thought you'd been captured!

318
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,420
I heard the sound of this
festival so I let myself out!

319
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,840
Captain Decken, we're here!

320
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,430
Wait there, Wadatsumi!

321
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,010
THE FISH-MAN DISTRICT "NOAH"

322
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,010
Uh-huh, okay!

323
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,470
This way, sir.

324
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,520
Thank you for waiting!

325
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,230
Vander Decken-sama is here!

326
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,400
Please!

327
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:49,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We ran into a volcanic eruption.

328
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,500
So you're the notorious Hordy?

329
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I suspect?

330
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,580
You're notorious, too.

331
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,920
Nutty Vander Decken.

332
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,140
--Nice to meet you.
--Oh, a handshake?

333
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,890
It's no good. Just a minute.

334
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,480
I'm all set!

335
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,900
Never mind!

336
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,150
Nice to meet you too, Hordy Jones!

337
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,330
We're unbeatable on the seafloor now.

338
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,790
The worst of the worst coming together!

339
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,630
Decken! Decken! Hordy! Hordy!

340
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,210
Decken! Decken! Hordy! Hordy!

341
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,260
Decken! Decken! Hordy! Hordy!

342
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Decken! Decken!

343
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,430
Neptune is a nuisance for both of us.

344
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,520
We have the same goal.

345
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,730
Beat Neptune's army who take no
pride in being Fish-Men or Mermaids...

346
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,070
...And kill Neptune, the God of the Sea!

347
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,200
And...

348
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,740
...We will destroy...

349
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,660
...The Ryugu Kingdom completely!

350
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,340
The Straw Hats are facing the
God of the Sea, Neptune's army.

351
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,410
Neptune's soldiers attempt to break

352
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,760
the bubbles protecting Zoro's group
to turn the tables of the battle.

353
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,740
Meanwhile, unidentified
pirates continue to attack

354
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,640
the Hard Shell Tower where
Luffy and Shirahoshi are.

355
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,350
The tension inside the Ryugu
Palace continues to rise!

356
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

357
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,020
"It's an Emergency!
The Ryugu Place Is Occupied!"

358
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
