2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,240
Protect Iceberg-san!

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,210
Yeah!

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,090
You're acting like I'm a stranger.
Please leave it to me.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,760
Well... You have my gratitude.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,720
There're tons of people there.

7
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,350
If we carelessly plunge in,
we'll be in big trouble.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,850
Look who's talking!

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,770
This is where we find out what we're made of.

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,930
Yeah...!

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,070
An explosion!

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,490
Things have gotten kinda crazy!

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,450
Hm? Where's Luffy?

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,290
Whaaat?!

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,330
Give it to us...

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,460
...and... we'd like you to die.

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,750
This is no longer something as
simple as an assassination, is it?

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,970
We're a group that carries out justice.

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,890
We are Cipher Pol No. 9,
an undercover intelligence agency.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,560
I see. So thanks to Luffy,
this is our chance to infiltrate, huh?

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,690
Are you guys ready?!

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,780
What part of this is light?!

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm stuck and can't move!

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,000
I have to hurry...

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,840
Just wait... Robin!

26
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,940
Dammit! Where'd they go?!

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,280
One person, and one animal with
two people. That's all we've confirmed.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,160
Shall we go guard the bedroom?

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,490
But our foremen are there.

30
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,120
There's no such thing as too
many guards. Let's go back them up.

31
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,070
What the hell is going on?!

32
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,490
Someone! Third floor!

33
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,700
Come to the front of the
president's room and the bedroom!

34
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,910
The guards were annihilated!
Someone! Come upstairs!

35
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,040
What are you saying?!

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,540
--Tilestone-san!
--Kaku and Lucci should be there!

37
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,790
But they're...

38
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,210
What?!

39
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,930
Kaku! Lucci!

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Good grief, there's no
end to this. No word yet?

41
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,110
You bastard!

42
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,530
How dare you...?!

43
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,990
What a noisy man.

44
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,950
Iceberg-san had better be okay!

45
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,620
Check it yourself.

46
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,830
Iron Body.

47
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,470
His giant hammer was...!

48
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,100
N... No way...!

49
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,810
You son of a...

50
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,640
Let go, you bastard!

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,270
Is that Herculean strength of yours your pride?

52
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,730
I can't move my arm!
There's no way my power can be beat...

53
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,080
It's all right! Now let's move forward

54
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,550
with the sun always in our hearts

55
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,920
As power passes through our clasped hands

56
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,590
let's grab hold of our wishes

57
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:01,530
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

58
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:08,910
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

59
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,830
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

60
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,960
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,380
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

62
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,300
but what you cherish most will be right there

63
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,350
And if you get into a jam

64
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,390
I'll always be there to protect you

65
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,520
It's all right! Now let's move forward

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,110
with the sun always in our hearts

67
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,110
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

68
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,370
and gaze at the light beyond

69
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,330
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

70
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,580
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

71
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,540
So let's grab hold of our wishes

72
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,340
under the same flag-- together, we're one

73
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,010
One Piece

74
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:26,940
"CP9 Takes Off Their Masks!
Their Shocking True Faces"

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,420
His giant hammer was...!

76
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,210
N... No way...!

77
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,920
You son of a...

78
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,880
Let go, you bastard!

79
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,390
Is that Herculean strength of yours your pride?

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,850
I can't move my arm!
There's no way my power can be beat...

81
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,910
Three of the foremen have been...!

82
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,460
Get some reinforcements from downstairs!

83
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,040
Shave!

84
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,470
--We found them!
--It's Roronoa Zoro!

85
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,720
They showed up at last!

86
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,680
Don't let them get away!

87
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,720
I saw that woman this afternoon, too!

88
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,980
After them!

89
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,230
Hey! Why isn't Luffy here?!

90
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,810
How should I know?! I wanna ask that question!

91
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,980
What do we do?!

92
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,820
Now that it's come to this, it's like
we've been caught in the act anyway.

93
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,660
If we go on the offensive,
there's a way to get in.

94
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,620
What?! Hey, Zoro! What're you gonna do?!

95
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,460
Running around the building
won't get us anywhere.

96
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,080
We'll openly plunge in from
the front and look for Robin.

97
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,670
What?!

98
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,170
But they're shipwrights!
They're not our enemy, you know!

99
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,420
Don't worry. I'll use the back of my swords!

100
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,060
Out of our way!

101
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,520
But you're inflicting fatal wounds on them!

102
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,210
Well... I'm shocked.

103
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,630
To be honest, I never thought
I'd see you here... Nico Robin.

104
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,590
Have we met before?

105
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,430
No.

106
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,760
We met for the first time last night.

107
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,560
But I've wanted to see you all this time.

108
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,360
I even put your wanted poster up
in my room to ensure I never forgot.

109
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,610
Shall I give you my autograph or something?

110
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,360
That would be... nice!

111
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,410
So you wanted to kill me?

112
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,750
That's right.

113
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,370
Before you destroy the world!

114
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,590
Why do you go searching for the Poneglyphs?!

115
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,090
Since ancient times,

116
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,260
the Government has declared
globally that it's a serious crime

117
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,680
to seek and decipher the Poneglyphs.

118
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,510
I'm sure you know that much.

119
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,980
You too know of the
existence of the Poneglyphs.

120
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Just knowing about it wouldn't be a crime.

121
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,940
But the only one in the whole world
who can decipher those texts...

122
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,400
...is you.

123
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,370
That's exactly why the Government
put a bounty on your head,

124
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,290
even though you were only eight years old.

125
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,830
It's because you're the only one in the world

126
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,460
who can restore the ancient weapon!

127
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,710
I see... So you even know about the weapon...

128
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,220
All things considered...

129
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,640
...I never thought CP9 was an
organization that really existed.

130
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,140
If it does, it means that you've
already left the Straw Hat Pirates

131
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,230
and have been helping the Government.

132
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,400
It's bizarre for a woman who's been
pursued for 20 years to act like that,

133
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,780
but, well, that's not my concern.

134
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,860
If the weapon gets restored through
deciphering the Poneglyphs,

135
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,410
whether its owner is righteous or evil,
the result will be the same.

136
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,330
The weapon can never bring
forth "peace" to this world.

137
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,830
The world will go under for sure.

138
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,220
We mustn't call forth a relic of the past!

139
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,180
You're right. I do agree with you.

140
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,480
But it's none of your business.
Whatever I do to research history,

141
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,230
you, a stranger, have no
right to say anything to me.

142
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,070
Well... not quite...

143
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,570
...since you and I are in
the same boat, in a sense.

144
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,030
I...

145
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,250
I have the blueprints of
the ancient weapon Pluton.

146
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,370
The blueprints of the weapon?!

147
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,170
Pluton is the name of a battleship
built on this island a long time ago.

148
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,050
The shipbuilding engineer who created
this overwhelmingly powerful weapon

149
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,510
had the blueprints passed
down for generations.

150
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,140
He felt that if by some chance
Pluton started running out of control,

151
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,730
there would need to be a force to counter it.

152
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,230
In order to get them...

153
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,900
...the Government has finally
resorted to using force.

154
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,530
To think that you're helping
them without knowing that...

155
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,370
I'm too shocked to speak.

156
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,080
The man named Tom,
who entrusted the blueprints with me,

157
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,910
had been concerned about a girl

158
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,290
who alone was able to escape from
the Ohara incident 20 years ago.

159
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,300
He said that although she was small,

160
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,010
she was dangerous, since she had the
same ideology as the Ohara devils.

161
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,720
I inherited the creator's will, so I have
the responsibility of stopping you!

162
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,180
Now that the Government has come to
know of the existence of the blueprints,

163
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,100
essentially, it'd be better if I burned them.

164
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,650
But I can't do that, because you're alive,

165
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,110
and so there's still a possibility
that the weapon can be restored!

166
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,960
Is that all you want to say before you die?

167
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,960
With all due respect, even if you
killed me and stopped its restoration,

168
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,510
if the blueprints get stolen from you,
wouldn't it be the same thing?

169
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,980
Well...

170
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,980
...let me tell you one more thing.

171
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,940
You're the ones who got taken in by a plan.

172
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,010
Oh, that's it!

173
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,940
I was finally able to get out! That was terrible.

174
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,990
Okay, I'll swoop in this time for sure.

175
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,660
I'll go capture Robin. Gum-Gum...

176
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,740
...Rocket!

177
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,140
You're no match for our martial arts skills.

178
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,020
Now, hand it over already...

179
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,980
...or else it'll get dirty with your blood.

180
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,940
Dammit...

181
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,910
I thought... I could defeat you.

182
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,630
To tell you the truth...

183
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,630
...Iceberg-san told me to run right away.

184
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,220
He told me to drop it quickly and run...

185
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,980
...since...

186
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,400
...it's a complete fake.

187
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,650
What?

188
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,650
A fake, you said?

189
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,690
How foolish...

190
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,660
I don't know who you are, but this
means your plan failed, doesn't it?

191
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,870
How pathetic. Sorry, pal.

192
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,380
I don't even know what you're looking for.

193
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,590
How cocky... You think that you outwitted CP9?

194
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
In any case, even though you're only a decoy,

195
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,760
we can't keep you alive now
that you've become involved.

196
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,740
I got stuck! Dammit! I got stuck again!

197
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,450
Why does this always happen?!

198
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,700
Straw Hat...!

199
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,120
Huh?

200
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,200
Ah! The rope guy!

201
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,830
What happened to you? Are you okay?

202
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,290
You're covered in blood.
You sure are full of surprises!

203
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,170
That'd be you! This is the third floor!

204
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,510
Straw Hat Luffy...

205
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,390
So you took the trouble to come
to take the crime upon yourself?

206
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,430
Ahh! Masks! Are they masks?!

207
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,640
Then you people must be the ones
who're making Robin do stuff!

208
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,440
Give Robin back to us, you damn bastards!

209
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Dammit! Hey! Say something!

210
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,400
Tempest Kick.

211
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,450
Whoa!

212
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,000
His kicks cut the wall!

213
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,420
Straw Hat!

214
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,230
What the hell are these?

215
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,690
We've got an emergency situation.

216
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,730
We don't have time for you.

217
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,730
I can't move!

218
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,030
Hey, restrain that guy, too.
This is no time for fighting.

219
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,570
Right...

220
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,210
Click.

221
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,710
It's me. A problem occurred in our plan.

222
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,090
Everyone, come to the bedroom right away.

223
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,800
Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

224
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,720
Got that? Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

225
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,980
I wouldn't have minded playing
with you a little longer, but...

226
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,530
...something came up. So, excuse me.

227
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,820
What?! Are you trying to run?!

228
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,280
No.

229
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,120
Since something came up,
I gave him a finishing blow.

230
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,660
Ahhh! Lulu-san is...!

231
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,250
--No way...!
--By just one hit?!
--Hold it!

232
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,300
He flew again!

233
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,130
Are you... okay?

234
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
This is... nothing!

235
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,140
I see. Straw Hat, why did you come here?

236
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,100
Everyone thinks that you guys are the culprits.

237
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,020
I'm sorry... It was all because
of our wrong assumption.

238
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,110
Don't worry about it.
We're used to being pursued.

239
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,740
More importantly, a member of our
crew was taken by masked men.

240
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,830
So I came to take her back.

241
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,040
You're talking about Nico Robin, right?

242
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,170
You're strong when you fight, right?

243
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah, I am!

244
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,680
Can you beat them?

245
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,300
Yes, I can!

246
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,100
Then, fight with me! I wanna beat them, too!

247
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,930
--You do...
--Of course I do!

248
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:35,730
Why... Why does Iceberg-san have to be
killed by some totally strange idiots?!

249
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,860
Give me a break!
Who the hell are those people?!

250
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,910
The hell with the undercover
intelligence agency, bastards!

251
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,290
He was... my teacher.

252
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,250
He helped me to become
an established shipwright!

253
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,080
Why would someone like him be...

254
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,290
But you're too injured to...

255
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,460
I said I want to beat the
crap out of those idiots!

256
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,800
Who cares what happens to my body later on?!

257
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,060
I'm gonna fight to the
very last bone in my body!

258
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,930
Dammit! Take these off!

259
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,560
Okay! Take them off! Dammit!

260
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,050
Go home!

261
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,010
I've got nothing I could give you people!

262
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,880
If you don't, that puts us in quite a bind.

263
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,350
What should I tell you first...

264
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,570
...when you're about to die?

265
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,030
You disappointed me.

266
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,200
Lucci!

267
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,910
It's your own fault.

268
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,500
You should've given it to the
Government when they asked nicely.

269
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,960
Kaku!

270
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:27,260
If possible, I wanted to make this town
part of my memory without hurting you.

271
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,100
Kalifa...

272
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,100
So you also inherited your
master's obstinacy, huh?

273
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,060
Blueno, from the bar...

274
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,320
You guys... work for... the Government?

275
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,610
That's right. Going undercover
was a pretty easy mission for us.

276
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,330
In any case, your prudence
leaves me at a loss for words.

277
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,500
Now, Iceberg-san...

278
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,460
Where're the blueprints of
the ancient weapon Pluton?

279
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,010
Please tell us, before many people get hurt.

280
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

281
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

282
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

283
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

284
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

285
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

286
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

287
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

288
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

289
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

290
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

291
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

292
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

293
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

294
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

295
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

296
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

297
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,750
Don't tell me-- you guys are CP9?

298
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,920
Now, tell us where the blueprints are.

299
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,180
Nonsense. If the ancient weapon is restored,

300
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,260
the world will only fight over its power.

301
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,720
It seems that you don't trust
the power of the Government.

302
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,890
I just know how humans are, that's all, lad.

303
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

304
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,520
"Secret Bond! Iceberg and Franky"

305
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,990
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
