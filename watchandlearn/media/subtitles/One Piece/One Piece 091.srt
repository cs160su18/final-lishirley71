00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,490
Have a safe trip...

22
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,460
my stupid son...

23
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,780
"Goodbye Drum Island!
I'm Going Out to Sea!"

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,360
Whoa!

25
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,390
It's beautiful...

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,230
Yeah...

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,880
Cherry blossoms, huh?

28
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,970
Hey... is Chopper okay?

29
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,070
Let's leave him alone for now.

30
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,090
He's experiencing what it's like
to set out on a journey as a man.

31
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,420
Yeah, he is about to leave the
island he's spent his entire life in.

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,550
Yeah...

33
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,480
I'm leaving, Doctor... Doctorine...

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,510
My adventure... is finally starting.

35
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,140
This is a joyous day!

36
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,810
The moon is out and the
cherry blossoms have bloomed.

37
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,510
Chopper! Hey, Chopper!
You son of a gun!

38
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,780
How long are you gonna
be in a daze like that?

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,350
Drink!

40
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,280
What?

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,650
Come here and sing!

42
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,550
What?

43
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,890
Here, stick these
chopsticks up your nose!

44
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,630
What?

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,260
Really, what a grand nighttime
view of cherry blossoms...

46
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,600
How could we not have a
party at a time like this?!

47
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,290
Are you surprised?

48
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,940
You made friends with
some really crazy guys, huh?

49
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,680
Friends...

50
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,110
That's right. They're over the top,
but since you're one of us now,

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,750
you'll have to get used to it.

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,450
Karoo! What were you doing
frozen in the river?

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,650
He probably slipped or something.
He's a clumsy one!

54
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,550
Quiet, Mr. Bushido!

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,020
Yeah... yeah...

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,990
He says that the guy named Zoro was
swimming in the river and disappeared.

57
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,730
He thought Zoro was in trouble so he
jumped into the river and got frozen.

58
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,800
So it was your fault!

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,370
Ow...

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,680
Tony-kun, you can understand
what Karoo is saying?

61
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,150
Yes. I'm an animal by nature,
so I can talk with animals.

62
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,380
You can talk with animals?

63
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,210
That's incredible, Chopper!

64
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,680
To be able to do that along
with your medical skills!

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,450
Dummy! Praising me like that wouldn't
make me feel happy! You jerk!

66
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,580
He sure looks happy.

67
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,540
By the way, Nami, what do
you mean by "medical skills"?

68
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,990
Chopper is a doctor... a first-class one

69
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,260
with all the medical skills
hammered into him by Dr. Kureha.

70
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,870
What?!

71
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,310
Chopper! You're a doctor?!

72
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,840
Incredible!

73
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,550
No way!

74
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,870
Good Lord! What did you think Chopper
was when you asked him to join us?!

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,010
A seven-form transforming
interesting reindeer.

76
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,050
Emergency food.

77
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,840
What?!

78
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:09,220
Ah...! Darn it! I forgot to bring my
medical tools since I left in a hurry!

79
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,920
Can't be... Then what is this?

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,300
What?

81
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,620
My bag!

82
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,330
It was in the sleigh.

83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,530
How come...?

84
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,870
How come? Didn't you prepare
for the trip by yourself?

85
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,650
Ah...

86
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,670
After all... she knew
everything you were thinking...

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,340
What a wonderful person she is...

88
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,950
Ah! I got snot on the chopsticks!

89
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,070
Yeah...

90
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,010
Hey, Chopper, you try it too!

91
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,460
Geez... When you're reminiscing...
Right, Chopper?

92
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,790
Chopper?

93
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,760
Don't!

94
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,830
Okay... guys!

95
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,190
Attention!

96
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,770
You bastard!

97
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, I'd like to introduce

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,060
our new friend to you!

99
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,910
Sanji! Go!

100
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,910
Tony Tony Chopper!

101
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,930
He'll be our ship's doctor.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,930
I...

103
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,440
To celebrate his coming on board...

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,330
Hey! Listen to me, you jerks!

105
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,060
I...

106
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,420
I've never had this much fun before.

107
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
Yeah!

108
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,810
Let's toast to our new friend!

109
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,680
Yeah!

110
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,960
Cheers!

111
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,400
I wonder if they've left the island by now.

112
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,170
A reindeer with a first-rate heart
and first-rate skills as a doctor...

113
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,720
If the cherry blossoms that Hiriluk put
his life into really did lead to a miracle,

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,890
it'd have to be just that clumsy
reindeer going out to sea.

115
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,700
That kid... acting like he's all grown up...

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,660
He'll be a fine ship's doctor.

117
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,680
So, what're you gonna do from here on?

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,480
I was... working as the Captain
of the Security Guard under Wapol.

119
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,810
I will have to atone for that sin.

120
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,050
I was thinking about leaving this land

121
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,730
and entrusting this new
country to the citizens...

122
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,150
Are you... going to do that then?

123
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,310
No... I've come to realize that
leaving isn't the only way of atoning.

124
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,220
This country is breaking
the shackles of monarchy,

125
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,900
and a new country made by the
citizens' hands is about to be born.

126
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,720
There may be something I can do for
the birth of this country by staying.

127
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,940
I feel that that is indeed
a way for me to atone.

128
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,880
Humph, you youngster...

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,930
You do have a heart
to care for the country.

130
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,440
A heart to care for the country, huh...?

131
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,950
I once learned it from
a girl who was only ten.

132
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,230
"The Holy Land of Marie Jois"

133
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,230
Ahh... World Summit?

134
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,400
Such a tiresome, worthless event.

135
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,390
It is, indeed.

136
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,990
I wonder if the Drum Kingdom
will be okay like this...

137
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,470
The rift between the king
and citizens keeps growing...

138
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,820
Ah...

139
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,890
It's the king of the Alabasta Kingdom...

140
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,380
It's Nefertari Cobra-sama!

141
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,650
So that's the king of Alabasta,
famed for his benevolence and wisdom.

142
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,180
Revolutionist Dragon...
This man's ideologies are dangerous.

143
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,210
It's very clear that he'll become a
big enemy to us, the World Government,

144
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,490
in 5-6 years and stand in our way.

145
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,510
Ahh... How ridiculous.

146
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,250
That has nothing to do with my country.

147
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,480
I govern my country so that my people
won't be led astray by a revolutionist.

148
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,320
If you guys wanna capture him,
go ahead and do it on your own.

149
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,420
Wapol!

150
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,130
You're too selfish!

151
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,890
What do you think the World Summit is?!

152
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,490
Act more responsibly!

153
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,220
Damn Nefertari Cobra!

154
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,640
Humph! What an unpleasant
conference that was.

155
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,470
Hm? That's...

156
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,980
That's the daughter of
that detestable Cobra!

157
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,820
Oops! My hand slipped.

158
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,640
Wapol-sama!

159
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,520
Vivi-sama!

160
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,370
Oh, excuse me. If I'm not mistaken,
you're the princess of Lord Alabasta.

161
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,330
What a poor child, to be the
daughter of that hopeless king.

162
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,090
You bastard! What're you doing?!

163
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,130
Stop, Igaram! I'm fine!

164
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,750
I'm sorry, too, for bumping into you.

165
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,530
What a child!

166
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,340
In the World Summit where kings gather,

167
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,740
even a minor argument can trigger a war.

168
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,600
She tolerates this situation knowing that?

169
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,960
Already at this young age...

170
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,740
Humph! What an annoying brat.
Let's go, Dalton.

171
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,190
Sorry.

172
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,120
It hurts!

173
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,400
You were magnificent, Vivi-sama.

174
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,340
The princess' heart to care for the country...

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,300
Her nobility hasn't changed one bit.

176
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,330
How magnificent she turned out to be...

177
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,520
Dalton-kun...

178
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,990
The heart to care for the
country still remains in us.

179
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,350
Let us do something...
to help this new country...

180
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,930
Hiriluk...

181
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,160
This country will surely be reborn...

182
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,300
just like your son, Chopper...

183
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,000
Dalton-san! This is serious!

184
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,410
I just remembered something serious!

185
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,210
What is it?

186
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,730
Look at this.

187
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,750
It's him! The Straw Hat
pirate who beat Wapol!

188
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,270
There's no doubt about it!

189
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,090
A 30 million-berry bounty is
on his head... They are...?

190
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,800
Oh? They're quite the rogues, aren't they...

191
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,160
Where did you find this?

192
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,770
Well... I completely forgot
to report it to you, but...

193
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,820
about a week ago, a man who
appeared to be a traveler

194
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,610
suddenly appeared in Robelle Town.

195
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,010
It was an unusual day where no snow fell.

196
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,080
We don't know where he landed.

197
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,090
Anyway, this guy said that
he was after Blackbeard,

198
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,230
the pirate that attacked this country.

199
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,950
But once he realized that
Blackbeard was long gone, he said,

200
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,500
Then let me ask you one more question.

201
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,800
Has a pirate wearing
a straw hat come here?

202
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,460
When we said we didn't know,
he showed the wanted poster and said,

203
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,570
If this guy comes here...

204
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,180
If he does...?

205
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,470
tell him that I'll wait for him
in Alabasta for just 10 days.

206
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,150
Okay?

207
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,290
Hey! Wait! What's your name?

208
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,110
Oh yeah... I forgot...

209
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,430
My name is Ace.

210
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,310
If you tell him that when he comes,
he'll know who I am.

211
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,710
Hey, please catch him!
He just ate and skipped on the bill!

212
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,990
Ahh! Well then,
tell him, okay? Thanks!

213
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,550
He'll wait for 10 days in Alabasta... huh...?

214
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,820
Hm? Dr. Kureha, what's the matter?

215
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,120
You look out of it.

216
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,990
Do you know Gol D. Roger?

217
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,730
D? Are you talking about Gold Roger?

218
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,990
Is that what he's called these days?

219
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,430
It looks like...

220
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,250
my reindeer went with
an extraordinary guy...

221
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,870
So... the will of D... was still alive...

222
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,790
Amazing!

223
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,560
The sea is huge!

224
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,420
Of course! And the ones who go on
adventures on that huge sea are pirates.

225
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,750
I see! Pirates are
incredible after all. Hm?

226
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,940
Huh?

227
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,250
Whoa! What's that?!

228
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,180
It's a seagull.

229
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,760
There isn't a seagull that big.

230
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,870
Hey! Seagull!

231
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,790
Ahhh! It's coming!

232
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,140
See? I was right. It is a seagull.

233
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,060
Now's not the time to discuss that!
It's coming because you called it!

234
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,100
Amazing! It's a great adventure!

235
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,340
Hey, where's Luffy?

236
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,740
Hm?

237
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,080
Yoo-hoo!

238
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,340
Hey! Don't become bird food!

239
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,350
Ahh! It's terrible! A bird ate Luffy!

240
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,950
This is no time for playing around!
Luffy's in trouble!

241
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,620
Did he say he wanted our help?

242
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,260
No, he didn't.

243
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,660
Then there's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

244
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,670
But...

245
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,370
Gum-Gum...!

246
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,430
Propeller!

247
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,310
Amazing...

248
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,810
Ahhh!

249
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,100
Hey, Sanji! I've got some meat! Huh?

250
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,740
What? Are you guys sleeping?

251
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,480
It's your fault!

252
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,610
How are you gonna fix this situation?
I had a good hand!

253
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,390
Really? Sorry.

254
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,150
Whoa! That's huge!

255
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,690
Now we can have some decent meals.

256
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,850
Is this edible?

257
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,870
Hm? What's the matter, Chopper?

258
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,050
Yeah...

259
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,240
Well... Pirates are...
Pirates are incredible after all!

260
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,290
Yeah? Incredible, huh?

261
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,800
Hey, you guys!

262
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,170
Hm?

263
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,970
This ship is arriving at Alabasta soon.
We don't have time to play around!

264
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,970
Move it!

265
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,890
All right...

266
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,250
So, what's Alabasta?

267
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,250
It's the country that Vivi's father governs.

268
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,390
A rogue named Crocodile is trying
to take over Alabasta right now.

269
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,610
I hear that Crocodile is one of
the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

270
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,310
Seven Warlords of the Sea?

271
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,760
They're the pirates authorized
by the World Government.

272
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,000
Pirates are authorized by the Government?

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,570
Yeah. They're overwhelmingly strong.

274
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,410
And, they crush other pirates one by one.

275
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,190
So the Government authorizes
them to crush pirates.

276
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,540
Crocodile, huh...? I can't wait to see him.

277
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,990
Crocodile is a hero in Alabasta because
he crushes the pirates that attack towns.

278
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,280
But that's only his public face.

279
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,060
Behind the scenes, he is pulling strings
to cause a civil war in Alabasta...

280
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,000
in order to take over Alabasta...

281
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,760
No one has noticed it.

282
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,700
The citizens... My father... No one...

283
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,120
All right then! In any case, all we have
to do is beat up that Crocodile, right?

284
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:19,050
Yes. If we can first stop the
civil war and expel Baroque Works...

285
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,450
Baroque Works...?

286
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,190
Ahh... Yeah, you don't know
about them either, do you?

287
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,920
To be honest, I can't
quite understand, either.

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,130
Baroque Works has a complicated system.

289
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,810
The system itself is simple.

290
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,130
First, at the top, there's a boss, Crocodile...

291
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,440
in other words, Mr. 0.

292
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,310
There're 12 agents and one animal who
receive orders from the boss directly.

293
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,810
Each of the 12 agents operates
separately as a pair with a female agent.

294
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,270
Mr. 1 and Miss Double Finger.

295
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,750
Mr. 2 doesn't have a partner, though.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,690
Mr. 3 is the candle man we
met in Little Garden, right?

297
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,790
Yes. He was paired up
with Miss Golden Week.

298
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,840
Oh, that girl...

299
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,630
Mr. 4 is paired up
with Miss Merry Christmas.

300
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,730
I don't know much about
these two, either.

301
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,070
And that snot guy!

302
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,970
Mr. 5, right?

303
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,700
Snot?

304
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,440
Yeah. His snot is a bomb.

305
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,690
Mr. 5's entire body is a weapon.

306
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,580
Miss Valentine has the powers
of the Kilo Kilo Fruit.

307
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,160
It's that woman who can change
her weight freely, right?

308
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,090
From Mr. 1 through Mr. 5,
they're called officer agents.

309
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,620
They all have the powers of a devil fruit.

310
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,180
And they work only on
really important missions.

311
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,360
For Mr. 6 through Mr. 13, their job
is fund raising for the company

312
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,220
by leading the employees at
the entrance of the Grand Line.

313
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,700
Come to think of it, there was
a strange monkey and chicken.

314
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,970
They're Mr. 13 and Miss Friday.

315
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,880
They're a punishment squad.

316
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,600
Their main job is to punish
those who fail missions.

317
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,810
Other than these people,

318
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,850
there're 200 subordinates called
"Billions" under the officer agents,

319
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,540
and 1800 subordinates called
"Millions" under the frontier agents.

320
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,310
This is the secret crime
syndicate, Baroque Works.

321
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,830
That means... 1800 plus 200, so...

322
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,360
There're 2000 subordinates?!

323
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,330
2000!

324
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,410
All right! I understand it very well now!

325
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,300
In any case, all we have to do
is beat up that Crocodile, right?

326
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,260
I'm sure you don't get it at all!

327
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,220
If Baroque Works' last big job
is to take over Alabasta...

328
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,550
the rest of those "officer agents" will all

329
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,630
gather in Alabasta.

330
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,530
Yes...

331
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,490
I see... Then, in any case,
we'll beat that Crocodile guy...

332
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,560
That's enough.
You keep your mouth shut!

333
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,320
Oh, yeah?

334
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,660
Un, deux, ora! Un, deux, krah!

335
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,170
I-I'm sorry, Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama!

336
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,700
Gimme a break!
Who do you think I am?

337
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm Bon Clay-sama,
a Baroque Works' officer agent,

338
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,550
who's so fearful that even a
crying child will become quiet.

339
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,480
Hey, you! You navigator, over there!

340
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,320
Y-Yes sir!

341
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,720
Just tell me! What's 0-chan's order?!

342
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,430
Kill Mr. 3 on the direct route
between Alabasta and Little Garden.

343
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,480
So you do know what it is.

344
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,670
Direct route means going
in a straight line, right?

345
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,740
That's why we traveled straight from
Alabasta to this Little Garden, right?

346
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,410
But then, what's going on?!

347
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,420
We got to Little Garden
without meeting Mr. 3!

348
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,870
Doesn't it mean that you
guys missed Mr. 3's ship?!

349
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,290
No... that can't be right...

350
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,490
Then are you saying that
it was because I'm stupid?

351
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,910
No... Mr. 2...

352
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,630
Shut up!

353
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:01,400
"Bon Clay"

354
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,270
Anyway, we can't be failing in the
"beating puny Mr. 3 mission"

355
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,380
at an important time like this!

356
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,870
We can't afford to fail.

357
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,850
If we did, Mr. 1 and his
partner will come to kill me.

358
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,990
Do you get that?!

359
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,100
If you don't wanna be my prey,
then look for Mr. 3!

360
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,020
Super full speed! We're heading
to Alabasta on the Swanda!

361
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,990
Now listen! Don't overlook
even a single small ship!

362
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,530
Yes sir!

363
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,000
Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama!

364
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,860
What? Pirates are attacking
towns in the Kingdom?

365
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,570
Don't they know this
country has Crocodile?

366
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,730
Who knows... Sir Crocodile...

367
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,880
Maybe a country where riots are going
on is an easy target for pirates...

368
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,400
Are you going?

369
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,360
Sure. I have to do a good job
for my public position, too.

370
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,650
How kind of you...

371
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,190
Of course.

372
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,200
The Seven Warlords of the Sea
are pirates who crush other pirates.

373
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,650
We're heroes to people.

374
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:24,430
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

375
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

376
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:47,110
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

377
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:57,590
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

378
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

379
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,340
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

380
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

381
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,950
Hey, make something, you damn cook!

382
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,820
I can't because a certain idiot
ate all the food.

383
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,120
What a useless cook...

384
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
Huh?! Looking for trouble, you bastard?!

385
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,060
Shut up, you two!

386
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,460
It's your fault!

387
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,190
Look! We can now see the island!

388
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,360
All right! We'll land then!
And eat! Oh, and Alabasta!

389
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,830
It's a side note?!

390
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,170
On the next episode of One Piece!

391
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,240
"Alabasta's Hero and
a Ballerina on the Ship."

392
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,540
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
