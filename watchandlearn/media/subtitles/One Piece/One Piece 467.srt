2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,150
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,740
Luffy has rushed to Marineford,

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,320
scene of a battle between the
Whitebeard Pirates and the Navy...

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,530
...to rescue his brother, Ace!

63
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,950
Attention, all ships and soldiers!

64
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,250
When you are all set, we
move the schedule forward...

65
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,490
...and execute Ace immediately. That's all.

66
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,340
--Luffy-kun...
--Let's move!

67
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,130
Let's go!

68
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,850
H-Hey!

69
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,680
No! That's not the side!

70
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:40,500
Ace!!

71
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,510
H-Hey, don't tell me that's...!

72
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,220
Crocodile!

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,350
That's not all! Who is in that lineup?!

74
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,220
All forces are here on both sides!
There are a lot of big names!

75
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,800
The world's got to be ready for it!

76
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,060
Ace, we're coming to rescue you!

77
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,740
We're here for you!

78
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,900
Garp! It's your family again!

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,820
Luffy!

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,370
The grandson of the hero--Garp and
the son of the revolutionary--Dragon.

81
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,670
I'll take care of him for good!

82
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,760
Where's Croco boy?

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,930
Oh? I think he chickened out and...

84
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,640
There he is!

85
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,270
He went ahead of me!

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Long time no see, Whitebeard.

87
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,560
You never learn.

88
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,250
Now that we are here, our
agreement has been fulfilled.

89
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,830
Why do you want to protect Whitebeard?!

90
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,630
As I thought--this old man is Whitebeard.

91
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,170
Then leave him alone! Ace likes this old man!

92
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,590
Ace's brother is quite a fighter.

93
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,310
You came here to rescue your brother?

94
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,260
Yeah.

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,810
Do you know who you're messing with?!

96
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,040
A squirt like you will be dead meat!

97
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,820
Shut up! That's not up to you to decide!

98
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,280
I know what you're up to!

99
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,580
You wanna
become the King of the Pirates, right?!

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,040
But I'm the one who'll become the King!

101
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,600
How saucy you are!

102
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,520
I won't forgive you if you
cause me trouble, spoiled brat!

103
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,060
I'm gonna do as I like!

104
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,290
I'm gonna rescue Ace!

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,920
"Even If It Means Death! Luffy
vs. the Navy; The Battle Starts!"

106
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,170
He's the... rookie--Straw Hat!

107
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,840
How does he know Whitebeard?

108
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,920
I don't get it!

109
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,760
He should hide after
breaking out of the great prison!

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,330
Why bother coming to this living hell?!

111
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,730
--Because he is Luffy-san.
--Huh?

112
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,940
That's the way he is!

113
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,820
Pops! Luffy!

114
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,200
So he is Straw Hat.

115
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,160
--Old man.
--Hmmm?

116
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,160
I heard while on a Navy ship that...

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,660
He's such a bonehead!

118
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,790
I wish he'd just get his
ass kicked already! Stupid!

119
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,460
How brave he is! Only his son could do it.

120
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,430
So they're gonna execute Ace immediately?

121
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,680
Are you sure?

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,020
They said they would  after getting
"all set" for something...

123
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,440
...but they were using codes
so I couldn't understand.

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,190
I know that you wanna rescue Ace, too,
so I wanted to share that with you!

125
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,070
I see. That was important information.

126
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,700
Thank you.

127
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
No problem.

128
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:40,160
How can he talk on equal
terms with Whitebeard?!

129
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,560
Okay! Ace, I'm coming now!

130
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,290
Why is he so confident?

131
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,380
Gum-Gum...

132
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,890
...Bazooka!

133
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,890
Get outta my way!

134
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,980
So he is Ace's brother.

135
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,900
Keep up with the boy! Let's go, 3rd division!

136
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
We should go, too!

137
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,690
Wh-Wh-What?!

138
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,650
Really?!

139
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,830
14th division, let's charge ahead!

140
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,290
Yes, Commander Jill!

141
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,210
Luffy...

142
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,260
They're so encouraged by just one daredevil?

143
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,630
But our strategy is airtight.

144
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,760
Don't hesitate! Do as I said!

145
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,950
Damn Sengoku!

146
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,870
I bet he thinks that he doesn't need

147
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,230
to stick
to the schedule for the execution of a mere pirate.

148
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,690
The key is--after they're "all set" for what?

149
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,570
Pops! I heard that they're
moving Ace's execution forward!

150
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,290
I heard. How're Squard and the others doing?

151
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,210
They're tied up with the vice admirals at
the bay head. I'm gonna fly there and help...

152
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,120
No, wait.

153
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,170
I bet it must be a part of his plan that
we'd get some leaked information and advance.

154
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,690
Sengoku wouldn't let his enemy
know his strategy so easily.

155
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,850
He's not that foolish.

156
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,560
Keep going!

157
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,360
A kick at the speed of light?!

158
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,950
Don't push your luck. I won't
let you invade that easily.

159
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,620
It's Admiral Kizaru!

160
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,580
You're the guy from Sabaody!

161
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,090
Yes, I was gonna ruin you there because
the Celestial Dragons wanted it.

162
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,300
Straw Hat Luffy.

163
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,590
S-Straw Hat is dead!

164
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,260
Death...

165
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,390
...Wink!

166
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,150
No! I wanna go home!

167
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,820
--What, Captain Buggy?!
--I can't believe what you just said!

168
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,790
You mean you wanna destroy Kizaru
quickly so you can rush home?

169
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,210
Only a legendary pirate could
face Admiral Kizaru without fear!

170
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,590
You guys are too positive!

171
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,880
Straw boy, are you okay?

172
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,340
That was close! Thanks, Ivan-chan!

173
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,430
My only mission is to save you!

174
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,520
Kizaru, again!

175
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,190
Huh? No, it's not! That's...

176
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,020
Kuma!

177
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,520
He's the bear-like guy who blew us all away!

178
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,610
Rolling Spa!

179
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,620
Bartholomew Kuma!

180
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,320
How despicable you are!

181
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,580
I know that you have a
role as a Warlord but...

182
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,250
...we've known each other so long.
How can you just fire a laser at me?!

183
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,010
Hey, how could you...

184
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,220
A hole!

185
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,470
Ivan-chan!

186
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,350
Don't worry about me!

187
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,640
Leave this to me and just go ahead!

188
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,900
Okay!

189
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,230
Let's do this!

190
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,050
It's so unlucky of you to run into us!

191
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,680
Straw Hat, you're gonna die here!

192
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,390
Huh? Who are you?

193
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm Fullbody!

194
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,100
You gotta pay for what happened at
the on-the-sea restaurant--Baratie!

195
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,610
Oh, Sanji beat you there.

196
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,820
You should remember this chakram.

197
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,370
You're the hypnotist from Usopp's
village. Why're you here?

198
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,720
I honed my skill in the Navy.

199
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,620
With two chakrams, it's twice as effective.

200
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,290
When I say "one, two, Django,"
you're gonna get tired.

201
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,750
One, two...

202
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,880
...Django!

203
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,760
What are you two doing?

204
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,360
Hina disappointed.

205
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,540
I know you from Alabasta, don't I?

206
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,650
I have no time to play with you people now!

207
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,680
I won't let you get away! Kimono Sleeve Cage!

208
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,080
I will bind anyone who passes through me!

209
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,380
--That's her signature phrase!
--Miss Hina is so captivating!

210
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,840
I'm sick of being in bars! Second Gear!

211
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,430
Th-That was fast! I couldn't see him!

212
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,100
Hina failed!

213
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,350
We failed, too!

214
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,020
We're bound by Miss Hina--body and soul!

215
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,030
THE BAY HEAD OF MARINEFORD

216
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,370
Don't fight the vice admirals
alone! They'll defeat you!

217
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,760
Captain Squard! It's getting
frantic inside the bay!

218
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
I know!

219
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,750
I gotta hurry up and get to Ace.

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,010
The wall that Oars broke.

221
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,760
If I sneak in from here,
maybe I can outsmart them.

222
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,890
You are...!

223
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,870
Stop!

224
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,630
Gum-Gum...

225
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,280
...Whip!

226
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
They're all strong!

227
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,080
Straw Hat! He's high-spirited as usual!

228
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,790
Oh yeah! I'll cut his shadow off
and implant it in Oars again!

229
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,720
Come on, zombie soldiers!

230
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Alright, zombie soldiers!
Go ahead and capture Straw Hat!

231
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,070
Moria! I don't wanna deal with him now!

232
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,980
Take your bullets back!

233
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,590
They're multiplying!

234
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:22,220
Yes, because this is a battlefield and and
all the corpses provide fresh zombies!

235
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,100
--Capture Straw Hat!
--He's the main suspect of the escape!

236
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,520
Keep going!

237
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,900
He's got to fight all these officers!

238
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,280
I wonder how long he can hang on!

239
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,370
Luffy!

240
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,110
Stay away, Luffy!

241
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,780
I know that you know it!

242
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,370
We're both pirates!

243
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,410
We both sailed on the sea as we liked!

244
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,670
I have my own adventures!

245
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,150
I have my own friends!

246
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,670
Ace!

247
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,260
I want you to...

248
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,130
...keep your hands off of them!

249
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,800
A wimp like you wants to save me?!

250
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,830
Outta my way!

251
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,140
You think that I'll allow you to do that?!

252
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,310
It's so humiliating!

253
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,270
Go back, Luffy! Why did you come here?!

254
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,730
I beg you, Luffy! I don't
want you to share my fate!

255
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,640
This is all my fault!

256
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,290
I'm...

257
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,210
...your brother!

258
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,880
Did you know?

259
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,960
We can become brothers
if we exchange this cup of sake!

260
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,370
From now on, we're brothers!

261
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,700
--Did he just say "I'm your brother?"
--He's also a son of Roger?

262
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,580
When Ace was born, both of his
parents died. That's impossible!

263
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,660
I don't give a damn about...

264
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,330
...the rules of pirates!

265
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,100
You hardhead!

266
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,260
Go, zombie soldiers!

267
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,230
S-Seawater?

268
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,410
Jimbei!

269
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,940
If I remember correctly, Moria, your
zombie soldiers can't take salt.

270
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,700
--Luffy-kun, let me handle them!
--Great!

271
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,160
--"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei!
--The former Warlord.

272
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,120
What are you doing?! Don't let this
rookie take control of the war!

273
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,540
Move out of the way!

274
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,990
I'm gonna crush him up!

275
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,140
He's also a loose cannon!

276
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,480
He grew up together with
Ace as his step-brother

277
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,600
and he's a biological son
of the revolutionary Dragon!

278
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,820
The revolutionary Dragon?!

279
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,020
The worst criminal in history?!

280
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,860
--Sounds very familiar!
--His daddy's got such a big name!

281
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,090
--He revealed it!
--Luffy-san...!

282
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,580
Luffy...

283
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,620
I couldn't care less even
if you were the devil's son!

284
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,710
I didn't know that!

285
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,040
That explains everything!

286
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,680
You bastard! Gum-Gum Pistol!

287
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,560
I finally understand  what
happened at Loguetown!

288
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,860
That's why Dragon saved Luffy.

289
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,570
Did you hear that?

290
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,280
They mean that Dragon?!

291
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,700
Head Office! I'm calling from
Sabaody! We've got big news!

292
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,910
Spread this all over the world!

293
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,080
We can't allow him to live!

294
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,880
Kill him at any cost!

295
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,050
Who cares? There's no need to hide it anyway.

296
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,680
That label won't hurt him because
Luffy is already a notorious outlaw.

297
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,430
You brothers are both fools.

298
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,440
Third Gear!

299
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,530
Gum-Gum...

300
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,820
...Giant...

301
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,950
...Rifle!

302
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,670
Ace!

303
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,720
You can say whatever you want!

304
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,850
I'm gonna save you even if it means death!

305
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,390
--That brat!
--We all feel the same way!

306
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,350
--We're Ace's family, too!
--We're gonna save him at any cost!

307
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,820
Marco, we can't let that kid die.

308
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,110
Alright.

309
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,140
Luffy!

310
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,660
Luffy and the Whitebeard Pirates
continue to run forward.

311
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,140
As he watches his friends face off
against foes with awesome powers,

312
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,300
Ace comes to a decision.

313
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,930
Meanwhile, the Navy enacts a new plan.

314
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

315
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,680
"Hard Battles, One After Another! Devil
Fruit Eaters vs. Devil Fruit Eaters!"

316
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,180
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
