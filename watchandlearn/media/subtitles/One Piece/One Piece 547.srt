Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,140
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,150
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,420
On their way to the New World,

74
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,920
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

75
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,300
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

76
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,600
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,060
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

78
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:45,160
"Back to the Present!
Hordy Makes a Move!"

79
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,450
Jimbei!

80
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,910
Damn! Who shot our queen?!

81
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,750
Look for the shooter!

82
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,540
Leave no stone unturned!

83
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,590
Brother Tai! Queen Otohime! I... I...

84
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,060
What should I do with this anger?!

85
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,900
Shit! Dammit!

86
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,900
There he is! We found the shooter!

87
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,440
Go! Get to the rooftop now!

88
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,410
Is he the shooter?!

89
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,410
He had a gun in his hand. There is no doubt.

90
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,830
What?

91
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,750
Where is he?!

92
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,250
Jimbei-san! We just killed him.

93
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,300
Who was it?

94
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,960
Well...

95
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,970
It's a...

96
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,310
...human!

97
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,520
Hide the body!

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,650
What? Boss Jimbei!

99
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,360
It will ruin the Queen's efforts!

100
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,870
She won't be able to rest in peace like this!

101
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,580
But it is what it is.

102
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,920
No, because he was a pirate!

103
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,460
It doesn't matter if he was a pirate or not.

104
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,840
No, Hordy! Don't do it!

105
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,430
Listen, everyone!

106
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,230
It was a human...

107
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,900
...who killed our queen!

108
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,950
Queen Otohime was killed by a human!!

109
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,960
She didn't deserve it!

110
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,380
A human...

111
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,760
...killed the Queen who wanted
nothing but peaceful coexistence

112
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,770
and broke our hearts just when we were
inspired by her words and about to...

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,310
...extend our friendship!

114
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,400
He took our beloved one's life!

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,900
Even by taking your life,
Otohime-sama can never come back, human!

116
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,330
Is there no justice in this world?!

117
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,500
It's so sad! Unbelievably sad!

118
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,430
Is the King still in the Hard Shell Tower?

119
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Minister of the Left!

120
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,440
Can you hear that? He's lost all control.

121
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,820
King-sama!

122
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,570
Lock the door!

123
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,160
Don't open it while I have
this urge to kill someone!

124
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,850
King-sama, it's me.

125
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,900
Minister of the Left.

126
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,150
The shooter had a gun in his hand so
one of our soldiers shot him dead.

127
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,780
It was a human.

128
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,370
I would have killed him
even if he were unarmed.

129
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,880
But Otohime would not allow that.

130
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,670
I don't know when this
cycle of revenge started.

131
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,590
But if I kill somebody, I would
only perpetuate that cycle.

132
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,260
Witnessing my actions would
make children's eyes cold

133
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,060
and they would harbor
hatred and become bitter,

134
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,850
the cycle of revenge spiraling on.

135
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,780
I could relate to what Otohime was saying...

136
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,110
...as long as it was somebody else's problem!

137
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,030
But...

138
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,210
...why shouldn't I kill the man
who shot my wife to death?!

139
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,170
I can't understand that-jamon...

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,340
As a soldier, I have taken many
lives in reprisal for my friends.

141
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,600
I killed many humans who besieged us!

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,060
That is why I thought I have no place
helping Otohime in what she was doing

143
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,520
so I just stood by and watched.

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,940
Why should an innocent one like
her die and a man like me still live?!

145
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,450
I can't take over her quest
because my hands are sullied

146
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,580
by what I have done in the past-jamon.

147
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,880
B-But we all change and we all
are full of contradictions.

148
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,050
We Fish-Men, and humans too. And there are
things that only soldiers can protect.

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,680
A FEW DAYS LATER

150
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,770
King-sama!

151
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Thank you all.

152
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,360
It's my own wife's funeral
- I have to attend it-jamon.

153
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,790
Father-sama! Father-sama!

154
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,120
Shirahoshi...

155
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,760
Father...

156
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,510
My sons.

157
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm glad to see you.

158
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,810
I'm sorry to make you feel so left alone.

159
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,940
TO SHIRAHOSHI

160
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,940
Um... Father-sama, look at this.

161
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,110
What is it?

162
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,950
These letters keep flying in wherever I go.

163
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,120
There are already 5 of them, Father-sama!

164
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,660
It's...

165
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:33,000
I'M IN LUV WITH YOU. I SUSPECT.
MARRY ME. VANDER DECKEN

166
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,250
...a love letter!
But Shirahoshi is only 6 years old.

167
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,000
Who is Vander Decken?

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,040
That is the name of a pirate family.

169
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,970
My children won't attend the funeral!

170
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,090
What?

171
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,180
There could be an accomplice
still lurking around.

172
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,220
And catch this pirate named Decken now!

173
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,480
Yes, sir!

174
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,100
Everyone!

175
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,980
Look at the monitor!

176
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,020
--Prince Fukaboshi!
--Prince-sama!

177
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,570
Fukaboshi...

178
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,990
Citizens of the Fish-Man Island.

179
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,830
There is something I
want to tell you all today.

180
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,840
So please give me your attention.

181
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,390
In her last moment, my mother said happily,

182
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,970
"We are almost there at that
place under the real sun."

183
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,850
We have decided to take over

184
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,150
our mother's dream and dedicate
our lives to seeing it through.

185
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,940
Princes...

186
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:29,530
You probably are not going to be
ready for the World Summit in 2 years.

187
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,410
But there will be another one in
6 years and another in 10 years.

188
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,210
I'm sure this tragedy made you
change your view of humans.

189
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,920
So I will get rid of all the
signatures that were left unburned.

190
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,260
Let's start from the beginning!

191
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,560
And when your emotional
wounds heal someday,

192
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,490
let's dream about the sun together again!

193
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,520
And for the decade that followed,
not just Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi

194
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,900
but also the King and the Princess spoke
to the nation through the monitor

195
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,950
all while signatures kept mounting up again.

196
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,790
So that was how we have been fighting against
discrimination for the last 16 years

197
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,750
and the beginning of the Fish-Man Pirates.

198
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,590
Arlong, who did horrible
things to your hometown,

199
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,890
was like a brother to me.

200
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,690
If he engaged in violence, we were willing to
go anywhere in order to stop him ourselves

201
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,980
but he always paid off the
Navy soldiers around him...

202
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,990
...to keep his actions secret from the Navy.

203
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,990
As a result, I made you
and many others suffer.

204
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,960
I feel responsible!

205
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,260
Oh yeah?

206
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,680
Then why don't you cut your own belly?!

207
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,600
Sanji...

208
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,350
Pay her with your life!

209
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,190
I still won't forgive you but it
could relieve Nami-san of her pain!

210
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,940
Stop, Sanji-kun!

211
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,690
But Nami-san, what they
have done to you was...

212
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,950
That's a different story!
This man didn't mean to hurt us.

213
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,530
Nami-san...

214
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,370
I will take any punishment!
If it makes you happy...

215
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:24,920
Stop!

216
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,590
Stop. The only one I hate is Arlong.

217
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Anyway, I'm glad that you are not the
mastermind of the Arlong Pirates.

218
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,440
Because you're Luffy's friend, aren't you?

219
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,020
It's true that I've gone through
hell because of the Arlong Pirates

220
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,900
but I met my friends in
that horrible turmoil.

221
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,370
One thing led to another
and I am who I am today.

222
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,660
I'm not gonna hate you
because you're a Fish-Man.

223
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,080
So don't pity me because of my life!

224
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,760
It's not so bad because I'm
enjoying it in the present!

225
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,930
So it doesn't matter who did this...

226
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,270
Don't get angry on my behalf.

227
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,110
Don't tell the people
on the island anything!

228
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,820
Neither the tragedy we endured
nor of our anger towards humans!

229
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,780
Don't worry, Jimbei.

230
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,490
You two grew up together and
he's like a brother to you.

231
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,500
No wonder you couldn't just kill
him even though you were justified.

232
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,220
I don't deserve such words of kindness!

233
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,720
Thank you!

234
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,560
Nami!

235
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,740
Boss Jimbei-sama...

236
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:23,160
Oh! I know how hard it is to be a big brother!
You're the man, Jimbei!

237
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,540
I like Tiger and Otoshime
and everybody very much!

238
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,670
Shut up, Franky!

239
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,550
He must've been feeling so much pain...

240
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,390
What?

241
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,480
Luffy?

242
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,770
What?!

243
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,280
Hey, wake up!

244
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,370
That was a good nap.

245
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,740
I can't believe it! I thought it was
unusual for you to listen so quietly.

246
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,000
Huh? Jimbei, are you crying?!

247
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,710
What are you saying? I am not crying!

248
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,550
Why is that?

249
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,010
Cut it out! I said I am not crying!

250
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,310
Hmmm... Oh, well!

251
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
And Jimbei, what did happen to the
thief that Coward's mother caught?

252
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,060
You must've been sleeping most of
the time! That was the very beginning!

253
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,530
--Was it?
--It was!

254
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,200
Hey, so your name is Shirahoshi?

255
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,330
N-Nami-chin, she's the Princess!
You can't say "Hey"...

256
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,200
Yes. Oh, excuse me.

257
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,710
I was crying remembering my mother.

258
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,710
She was quite a woman, wasn't she?

259
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,590
Yes!

260
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,130
So you are Nami-chin-sama.

261
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,300
No, Mermaid Princess-sama!

262
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,510
Nami-chin is like her nickname.
Her real name has no "chin."

263
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:14,600
It feels like I have known you since I was a
kid although we just met for the first time...

264
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,940
I feel comfortable with you.

265
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,940
Yeah? Maybe that's because we've
been through similar things.

266
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,490
Now, excuse me.

267
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,710
I took too much time. I need to know
who is still at the Ryugu Palace now.

268
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,800
Hordy and his crew invaded the palace
and captured the King and his soldiers.

269
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,630
And you don't know what
happened to four of your crew.

270
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,550
That's all the information we have so far.

271
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,510
Jimbei-san.

272
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,680
If things are going as Hordy planned,

273
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,270
the whole country might be
in a terrible state by now.

274
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,400
Do you know what his plan is?!

275
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,110
I suspected he was up to something
in the Fish-Man District

276
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,700
after retiring from the army,

277
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,870
but he never revealed it to me.

278
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, I know.

279
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,460
Hordy hates humans more
than Arlong-san did.

280
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:26,680
He has been living on the resentment and
anger of the Fish-Men, and nothing else.

281
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:32,350
And there is something about him
clearly different from Arlong-san.

282
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:38,860
Arlong-san would look down on humans
but he would never hurt other Fish-Men.

283
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,900
But Hordy will attack those Fish-Men
who are sympathetic to humans...

284
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,740
...without mercy!

285
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,460
This year is the World Summit which
takes place every four years.

286
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,370
Since they gathered enough signatures,

287
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,750
King Neptune will express his
intention to the world finally,

288
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,510
to relocate the Fish-Man Island.

289
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,600
Don't tell me he is planning to block it!

290
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,520
No, he wants more than that.

291
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,280
Wh-What is that?!

292
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,410
That's a big Transponder Snail!

293
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,530
It's a Video Transponder Snail!

294
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,120
Why is it here?

295
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,460
Look! It's activated!

296
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,800
Oh, it's projecting something on the bubble!

297
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,510
That's...

298
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,890
He's the...

299
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,220
Nami-san, do you know him?

300
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,020
Hordy!

301
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,400
What?! That's him?!

302
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,100
Hatchin!

303
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,820
Uh, everybody on the Fish-Man Island.

304
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,530
Can you hear me?

305
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm the captain of the New Fish-Man
Pirates from the Fish-Man District,

306
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,500
Hordy Jones!

307
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,290
Hordy broadcasts his ambition
across all of Fish-Man Island.

308
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,800
His shocking intention is
to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom

309
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,760
and establish himself as the new king.

310
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,260
The citizens of Fish-Man Island
had been deeply unsettled already,

311
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:41,100
but Hordy's announcement has
further filled them with dread!

312
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,770
"The Kingdom in Shock!
An Order to Execute Neptune Issued!"

314
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
