00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,540
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,410
"Huge Duel!
The Giants Dorry And Broggy"

22
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,320
So...

23
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,360
What's the answer?

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,830
Wh-What was that?
C-Could you repeat that?

25
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,530
I asked you if you have any alcohol.

26
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,030
We've got a little...

27
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,040
So you've got some?

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,640
I-It's not for drinking.
It's for cooking and disinfection.

29
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,110
But if you like, we'll give it all to you.

30
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,320
Dino...

31
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,890
Dinosaur?

32
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,910
I'm Broggy, the Elbaf's strongest warrior!

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,880
Now I've got meat, too.
I'll treat you, my guests.

34
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,020
H-Hey...

35
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,690
P-Pretend we're dead...
No matter what happens...

36
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,600
D-Doesn't pretending to be
dead only work on bears?

37
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,880
Whoa! What a great view!

38
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,650
I wanna have lunch here.

39
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,990
This isn't the time for idle chatter!

40
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,660
Ahhh... Oh? So there really are volcanoes.

41
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,730
And there's a mountain
with huge holes as well...

42
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,670
It's dangerous! Come down already!

43
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,670
Huh?

44
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,340
Even if it's well-behaved,
it's still a dinosaur!

45
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,600
This guy's no trouble!

46
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,640
More importantly,
there're huge holes over there!

47
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,340
That's one weird landscape!

48
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,010
Forget about the landscape!
Just come down!

49
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,920
Say, I have a favor to ask.
Will you take me over there?

50
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,860
Hey, stop being so mean
and take me there.

51
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,200
Over that way! That way!

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,670
Not this way... Here! This way!

53
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,670
Who'd do something like that?!

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,770
Oh... sorry. But, uhm...

55
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,010
Amazing!!

56
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,020
Luffy-san! Like I said, it's dangerous!
Come down already!

57
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,960
And those dinosaurs are taller,
so it looks like I'll have a better view.

58
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,890
That's not the point!

59
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,230
As I thought, I can see the holes better.

60
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,240
Hmph!

61
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,740
Oops!

62
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,110
Hmph!

63
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,640
Watch out!

64
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,790
Vivi! Wanna come over here?! It's fun!

65
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,690
The view from here is especially good!

66
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,310
Ah!

67
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,110
He's been eaten!

68
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,580
Where am I?

69
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,630
Whoa...

70
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,640
I was watching. What a lively human,
grappling with longnecks in this jungle.

71
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,970
You're the first guest in a long time.

72
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,980
You're huge! Are you a human?

73
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,310
You're asking me if I'm a human?

74
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,020
I'm Dorry, the Elbaf's strongest warrior!

75
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,320
G... Giant!

76
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,630
I've heard of them, but this is my
first time actually seeing one...

77
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,930
I'm Luffy. I'm a pirate.

78
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,940
A pirate?! Good for you!

79
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,670
Karoo! Wake up!

80
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,940
We're getting out of here while we can!

81
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Oh yeah, the ones over there are
Vivi and Karoo. Nice to meet you!

82
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,950
Luffy-san had to open his big mouth...!

83
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,790
I'll invite you guys to my home!

84
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,180
It looks yummy.

85
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,320
How long do we have
to pretend to be dead?

86
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,390
After all, this strategy doesn't
seem to work against a giant.

87
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,830
Hmm... I guess it was my imagination.

88
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,740
Why'd you make a noise?

89
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,010
I couldn't help it since there're
tons of skulls lying around!

90
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,010
I know, but...

91
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,010
I wonder if we'll be
eaten like that soon...

92
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,020
Don't give up!

93
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
But...

94
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,520
We don't have to wait here
like this just to be eaten.

95
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,690
It's yummy! It's yummy!
Dinosaur meat!

96
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,030
Grill it with red flame
and take a big bite!

97
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,370
It's yummy! It's yummy!
Dinosaur meat!

98
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,410
--That way!
--It's yummy! It's yummy!
Dinosaur meat!

99
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,040
--It's yummy! It's yummy!
Dinosaur meat!

100
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,080
Dinosaur meat...

101
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,000
I-in any case...
we were able to escape...

102
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,240
At least we got far away
from the giant's stomach!

103
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,790
But it might've only gotten us closer
to a saber-toothed tiger's stomach...

104
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,420
No! No! No! No!

105
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,060
In this jungle, no matter what we do,
our fate will always be the same!

106
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,670
It's just a matter
of whose stomach we end up in...

107
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,670
We did everything we could.
Let's accept our fate...

108
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,670
Oh, you guys're awake?

109
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,410
The meat is done. Have some!
It's in return for the alcohol.

110
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,800
Now, eat! Dinosaur meat tastes good.

111
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,030
I-I have no appetite.

112
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,140
Don't hold back!

113
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,540
I don't want to eat.

114
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,650
Dinosaur meat tastes good,
I'm tellin' ya...

115
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,650
Is he trying to get us to
eat the dinosaur meat first...

116
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,480
...in order to fatten us up a little...

117
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
...and then eat us?

118
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,990
Yeah, he's acting like a giant, all right.

119
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,490
When we're still so young...

120
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,660
Maybe we taste best when we're young...

121
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,160
What a waste...

122
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,730
It's good, I'm tellin' ya...

123
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,940
If we somehow keep fasting until
the Log is stored and don't get fat,

124
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,670
we may be able to survive...

125
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,010
But how long will it take
for the Log to be stored?

126
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,540
If I don't eat for three days,

127
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,680
I'm sure I'll get tempted
by this smell of meat and eat it...

128
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,250
Broggy-san! Can I ask you a question?

129
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,360
Hmm? What's the matter, young lady?

130
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,090
H-How long will it take for the
Log of this island to be stored?

131
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,360
One year.

132
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,730
What?!

133
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh, no... There's no way
we can fast for a year...

134
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,310
I... definitely can't help eating...

135
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,080
Well, make yourselves at home!

136
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,320
This is yummy, giant old guy!

137
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,330
Your pirate lunch thing tastes good, too,
although it's a little too small for me.

138
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,230
Of course it's good!

139
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,000
That's a special lunch
the chef on my pirate ship made.

140
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,670
If you say it's bad, I'll beat you up!

141
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,240
Beat me up, you said?

142
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,350
What a funny squirt you are!

143
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,850
Th-They're becoming awfully friendly...

144
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,690
By the way, why are you
living here alone, old guy?

145
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,360
Isn't there a village or something?

146
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,290
Hmm? There is a village.
It's a warriors' village called Elbaf.

147
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,630
It's somewhere in the Grand Line.

148
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,630
Hm?

149
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,200
But there're rules in the village.

150
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,970
Rules?

151
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,640
For example, if we start a fight in the
village and both sides can't back off,

152
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,640
we are judged by Elbaf's god.

153
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,980
Elbaf's god always gives divine
protection to the righteous one

154
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,310
and lets the righteous one survive.

155
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,320
I see... Elbaf's god, huh?

156
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,390
I caused a disturbance, and
this island is currently the site

157
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,320
for a duel between a
certain man and myself.

158
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,690
The righteous one will
win the duel and survive.

159
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,500
But we haven't been able to
settle this for about 100 years.

160
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,670
You guys've been fighting for 100 years?!

161
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:07,310
It's nothing surprising, since our life span
is at least three times as long as yours.

162
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,350
Even if it's three times,

163
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,680
your interest in fighting would
wane in 100 years, wouldn't it?

164
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,250
Is there any point in continuing to fight?

165
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,250
It's a duel to the death, right?!

166
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,300
Well, I shouldn't be outdone
by Zoro with this one.

167
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,700
It's decided that I'm the winner of the
competition to obtain kilos of meat.

168
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,610
I'm the winner of the competition
to obtain tons of meat!

169
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,980
Zoro!

170
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,520
Sanji!

171
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,660
I win!

172
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,660
You lose!

173
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,670
Look! My prey is bigger!

174
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,340
What?! This competition is about how
many tons of meat we can get, right?!

175
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,010
Mine is obviously huskier than yours!

176
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,950
Ha! It's all a matter of if
we can use it for cooking.

177
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,510
Your prey looks full of bones.

178
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,280
It has no more than 5 grams
of meat for cooking!

179
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,290
There's no way we can eat
meat full of sinews like that!

180
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,620
Tsk! There's no use in
competing with such small prey.

181
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,630
I'll go capture a big
one that'll silence you.

182
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,800
Okay then. I'll go capture a super big
one that you can't even touch this time.

183
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Okay. The next eruption is the
signal to end the competition.

184
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,980
Bring back your prey
to the Going Merry by then.

185
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,650
Yeah, I'll take you up on that!

186
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,980
Whoa!!

187
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,320
That's a huge volcano eruption!

188
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Well, time to go...

189
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,490
Hmm?

190
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,340
What's that?

191
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,670
An eruption...

192
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,280
Hmm?

193
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,950
His face suddenly got tense...

194
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,290
Sorry... I have to head out for a bit.

195
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,860
What? Head out?

196
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,290
Yeah. That was a signal for the duel
that I've been in for 100 years.

197
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,630
A duel?

198
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,570
With whom?
Where and for what reason?

199
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,630
Reason? I don't remember.

200
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,640
It became our routine
before we realized it.

201
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,310
The eruption of the central mountain
is the signal for the duel.

202
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,550
What?! To have such hatred that you'd
try killing each other for 100 years is...

203
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,320
What on earth caused this fight?!

204
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,660
Stop it.

205
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
It's not like that.

206
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,440
Right. It's because of our pride.

207
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,010
I forgot...

208
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,550
...the reason a long time ago!

209
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,770
What? Wh-What's wrong?

210
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,580
Oh, boy... What a huge duel!

211
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,690
Hey, big lizard. You're in our way.

212
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,600
Let me take care of it.

213
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,140
10,000 Kilogram Press!

214
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,350
Oh hello, Mr. 5.

215
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:48,020
Ha! What an extravagant power you have,
building an improvised house in a jungle.

216
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,360
Let me tell you something, though.
This mission is still ours.

217
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,700
I don't want you to meddle in it.

218
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,370
We'll never goof up like that again.

219
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,370
--Goof up?
--Hmm?

220
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:04,570
That's not it. You two are weak,
Mr. 5, Miss Valentine.

221
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,210
Well, don't look so stern. Look at this.

222
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:22,660
I'd like to thank you for giving me
an opportunity to come to this island.

223
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Dorry the Blue Ogre and Broggy the
Red Ogre of the Giant Warrior Pirates.

224
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,900
I've heard of them in an old tale.

225
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,570
This is a wanted poster
from 100 years ago!

226
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,840
Yeah, but those guys
now live on this island.

227
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,680
Their bounty then was
100 million Berries per head.

228
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,350
200 million Berries
for the two of them.

229
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,350
200 million-Berry bounty heads?
But they're giants.

230
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:55,690
Superb criminals execute their
crimes by using their superb brains.

231
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,360
All you have to do
is follow my instructions.

232
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,030
If we give it a little thought,
we can cut through any mountain.

233
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

234
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

235
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

236
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

237
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,170
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

238
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

239
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

240
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

241
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

242
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

243
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

244
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

245
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,980
Hey, you! Capture a big one this time.

246
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,990
Ha! You'd better not bring back
a small lizard this time, either!

247
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,320
Shut up, you two!

248
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,660
A man-to-man duel has just started!

249
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,720
O-Okay...

250
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,990
What?! The alcohol exploded!

251
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,330
That's the barrel we gave them!
What's going on?

252
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

253
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,070
"Luffy Gets Angry!
A Dirty Trick Violates The Sacred Duel!"

254
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
