00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,580
Luffy and the gang have arrived in Enies Lobby.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,800
If we can't recover Nico Robin
and Franky on this straight path

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,050
"Iron Fence" "Main Gate"

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,510
from the main gate to the Gates of Justice,

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,510
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,010
"Gates of Justice" "Tower of Law"

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,010
we will have lost.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,180
Why?! No matter where Robin is taken to,

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,390
we can just keep going after
them until we get her back!

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,100
I explained this before we
left Water Seven, didn't I?!

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,520
The only destinations beyond those gates

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,980
are Navy Headquarters and the deep-sea prison.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,570
So we have to settle this matter
before that at any cost.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,690
She's right.

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,160
That being said, even if we all rush in,

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,540
if we encounter CP9, you guys are
the only ones who can defeat them.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,710
After the train ride together, I now
know well how strong you guys are.

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,090
So, you guys stay and wait
on the sea for five minutes

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,300
and charge in to the main island in
Rocketman through the main gate.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,430
We'll go in first and break open the
main gate and the main island front gate

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,800
so that the train can pass through.

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,770
After that, we'd like you to keep on
moving no matter how many of us fall.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,360
We're only a little over 60 people,

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,690
but our enemy's forces are
probably well above 2,000 to 3,000.

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:39,160
We'd like you guys to go after only CP9,
avoiding unnecessary battles.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,580
Okay, got it.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,750
Okay, guys! We're now
at the front of the island!

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,670
Take a good look at the sky behind Enies Lobby.

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,500
Those are the Gates of Justice.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,970
Whoooa! That's huge!

32
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,350
Now, there's no time to lose!

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,690
Well then, as we planned,
we're gonna go in first!

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,520
Leave the backup to us!

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,820
Hey, you two! Aren't you
supposed to be with us?!

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,280
All fired up to get back Robin, Luffy has...

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,610
Hm? Where's Luffy?

38
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,160
What? He was right here up until now.

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,370
Hmph!

40
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,840
Is that Straw Hat?

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,380
What?!

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,760
Oof!

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,220
What?!

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,050
Why the hell is he doing things on his own?!

45
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,680
That man doesn't have a
clue about the plan at all!

46
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,980
That was a waste.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,150
He said he got it, didn't he?

48
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,980
He's not the type who can wait five minutes.

49
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,360
We should've known.

50
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,990
...infiltrated Enies Lobby by himself.

51
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,410
Gum-Gum...!

52
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,790
Meanwhile, Spandam,
the chief who leads CP9, was...

53
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,910
Well...

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,670
Today is a joyous day when all
eight members of CP9, including me,

55
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,460
are to gather together in one place
for the first time in five years.

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,050
And yet, what's up with this article?!

57
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,300
The orders to assassinate
the heads of the local branches

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,520
of the revolutionary army only
required you to kill three of them,

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,060
but twenty-three of them are dead!

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,190
If you have an excuse, I'd really like to hear it!

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,400
Yoyoi!

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,190
...waiting for Lucci and the
others in the Tower of Law,

63
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,860
the back room of Enies Lobby,
with other members of CP9.

64
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,240
...my fault!

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,580
"CP9 [Six Powers Master]
Jabra"

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,040
Stop it, Kumadori!

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,580
A man shouldn't apologize so easily!

68
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,040
I'll explain what happened
to Chief, so just sit tight!

69
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,040
"CP9 [Six Powers Master]
Fukurou"

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,670
Iron Body.

71
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,010
How regrettable...! I can't die.

72
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,470
Just die already, you jerk!

73
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,470
You guys, that's enough...

74
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,850
Ouch! I spilt my coffee! Dammit!

75
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,310
Also, they said that Nero was useless.

76
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,820
Oh, well...

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,410
Whoa! What the heck is this place?!

78
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,410
What a huge hole! It looks
like the island is floating.

79
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,660
I see a town there, too. I wonder
if Robin is around there...

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,300
There's someone up there!

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,460
It's an intruder! Shoot him down!

82
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,800
Oops, they found me.

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
He went inside the gate!

84
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,140
Luffy passed through the
main gate in one shot and...

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,350
This is the main gate! This is the main gate!

86
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,730
This is a report to Chief and
the main island front gate!

87
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,320
What is it? What's going on?

88
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,030
An intruder went over the main gate

89
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,160
and is currently dashing towards
the main island front gate!

90
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,700
Oh... It's just an intruder.
Calm down and take care of him.

91
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Yes, but...

92
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,670
This is the main island front gate.
We confirmed the intruder.

93
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,130
...was approaching the main island
front gate by charging straight ahead.

94
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,800
Hey, hey. Stop.

95
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
Do you know what this place is?

96
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,890
Deal with him carefully. If my eyes
didn't deceive me, that man is...

97
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,640
...Straw Hat Luffy!

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,520
What?! What did you just say?!

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,230
I think that's Straw Hat...

100
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,240
A pirate with a 100 million-Berry
bounty on his head!

101
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,870
Robin...

102
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,350
Where is Robin?!

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,170
A-Another report from the main gate!

104
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,680
What is it this time?!

105
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,430
A suspicious group on a monster carriage

106
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,140
has just passed over the front iron fence!

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Please send reinforcements!

108
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,070
Please send...

109
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,910
What happened?!

110
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,290
Gatekeeper!

111
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,500
Come in!

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,920
What is going on?!

113
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,380
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

114
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,730
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

115
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:46,820
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

116
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,700
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

117
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:58,410
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

118
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,370
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

119
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,630
we will be able to make it through

120
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,880
Always!

121
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,600
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,560
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

123
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,610
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

124
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,190
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

125
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,450
We can't stop here

126
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,490
Around the world

127
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,700
Start me up!

128
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,460
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

129
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,590
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

130
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,550
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

131
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,350
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

132
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,350
Brand New World

133
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,900
Start me up!

134
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:20,990
"Luffy Cuts Through!
Big Showdown on the Judicial Island!!"

135
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,230
What's the matter, Nico Robin?

136
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,270
Don't stop.

137
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,870
"Courthouse" "Tower of Law"

138
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,210
"Main Gate"

139
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,640
Are you guys ready?

140
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,480
Are you hurt?

141
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,310
I'm fine, because...

142
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,230
...I'm Sogeking!

143
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,660
In four minutes... the sea train
Rocketman will charge in!

144
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,500
"Main Island Front Gate"
"Main Gate"

145
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,180
Excuse me, but... please let me pass.

146
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,360
Even if you ask nicely...

147
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
...no means... no!

148
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,570
Okay. Then...

149
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,540
...be prepared, okay?!

150
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,200
How dare you, pirate?!

151
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Gum-Gum...

152
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,330
...Ally Robot!

153
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,470
Whoa! That's dirty!

154
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,260
We can't attack him like that!

155
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,230
Such an obvious trick! Don't flinch!

156
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,270
Ally Robot... Punch!

157
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,530
Ahh! Sorry!

158
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,780
Ally Robot... Kick!

159
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,450
Ahhh! I'm so sorry, sir!

160
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,250
That's enough! Your back is wide open!

161
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,180
You bastard!

162
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,520
Bring him down! It's just one unarmed man!

163
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,760
What's with his agility?!

164
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,220
I'm in a hurry.

165
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,300
More people are coming later, so... See ya!

166
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,680
What?

167
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,100
Hey... stop!

168
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,030
He went inside! Hurry inside!

169
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,940
He entered the main island!

170
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,490
Let Chief know!

171
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,660
This is main island front gate,
reporting to Chief!

172
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,540
S-Straw Hat Luffy has entered the main island!

173
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,960
What?! You let him enter the main island?!

174
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,920
What the hell is going on?!

175
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,670
What are Oimo and Kashii doing?!

176
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,960
Did those two get taken out, too?!

177
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,720
No, sir! Since it's currently
in the middle of the night...

178
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,390
...they're probably sleeping.

179
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,640
This is no time for sleeping!
Get them out of bed!

180
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,310
All the guards sleeping on the main island, too!

181
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,180
Y-Yes, sir!

182
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,690
It's just an intruder.

183
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,110
You don't have to make
such a ruckus, right, Chief?

184
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,570
You've got us.

185
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,370
Don't be ridiculous! This is the judicial island,

186
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,620
which acts as a sacred symbol of the
entrance to the World Government.

187
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,290
Any idiot should know what
it means to invade this place!

188
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:26,170
And yet, he entered even the main
island just to get a crew member back.

189
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,550
It's shameful! How dare they mock us?!

190
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,930
Damn those Straw Hats and their subordinates!

191
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:53,160
Gatekeeper! Explain what's
going on at the main gate!

192
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,490
Hey, gatekeeper!

193
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,250
How many enemies are we looking at?!

194
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,420
What's their current location?!

195
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,920
Come in, main gate!

196
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,750
Hey, what's the matter?!

197
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,380
Come in, gatekeeper!

198
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,810
Rope Action! Figure-of-Eight Knot!

199
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,640
Bazooka Bat!

200
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,940
I don't wanna waste bullets on this!

201
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,900
Go inside through the side
doors and open the gate!

202
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,870
Don't let them open it!

203
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,240
Get out of our way!

204
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,040
Mozu! Go to the left!

205
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,790
Got it!

206
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,960
I won't let you!

207
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,040
Whoa! Bed-head is coming out of my nose!

208
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,420
You should pay attention!

209
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,420
Hurry up!

210
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,300
Thanks!

211
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,230
Keel Breaker!

212
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,820
Aren't they unlocked yet, Mozu, Kiwi?!

213
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,620
Ship demolition is the Franky Family's job.
Picking locks like this is...

214
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,290
This side is unlocked!

215
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,040
This side, too!

216
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,290
Okay, then! Open the gate,
Herculean Destroyers!

217
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,770
Don't let them open it! Defend it at all costs!

218
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,650
Move! You're in our way!

219
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,040
Rush in!

220
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,460
We broke through the first gate, the main gate!

221
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,590
Whoa! What the hell is this hole?!

222
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,800
We don't have time! Ignore that! Move forward!

223
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,230
Just keep moving and run towards
the main island front gate!

224
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,350
It's a waterfall!

225
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,070
We did it!

226
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,320
Hey, guys! This way!

227
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,490
Give me a hand right away!

228
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,120
Kashii-san! Oimo-san! Get up right away!

229
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,250
Th-The main gate has been forced
open by suspicious people!

230
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,090
Hm?

231
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,800
Hey, he said the main gate
was forced open, Oimo.

232
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,230
Yeah, that's not good, Kashii.

233
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,900
I hate having to get up.

234
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,940
But it's work. Let's go.

235
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,820
Oof!

236
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,000
What?!

237
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:46,270
"Kashii
'Main Island Front Gate'
Gatekeeper, Enies Lobby"

238
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,100
I didn't get enough sleep.

239
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,140
I'm gonna get rid of them
quickly and go back to bed.

240
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,270
Me, too.

241
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,980
G-G-Giants!

242
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,070
I don't know what you guys
came all the way here for,

243
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,070
but I suggest you go home before we crush you.

244
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,190
Right, Oimo?

245
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,910
Yeah, Kashii. I think so, too.

246
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,030
We're gonna squash you to your bones.

247
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,080
Giant gatekeepers?! This isn't fair!

248
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,330
They're huge! Our Herculean
Destroyers look small.

249
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,300
Now, go back!

250
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm not gonna let you go through this gate!

251
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,380
Me neither!

252
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,890
They're coming!

253
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,930
No matter who we're up against,
don't flinch, Franky Family!

254
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,850
This is for Bro!

255
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,890
Yeah!

256
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,650
Hey, you get it, right?

257
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,280
Yeah.

258
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,240
All right!

259
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,330
If we don't go, who will?!

260
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,210
The Herculean powers we
gained working in ship demolitions

261
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,750
are a match for those Giants!

262
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,250
Destroyers!

263
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,990
O-Our Herculean Destroyers are...!

264
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,900
In an instant...!

265
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,870
We're born warriors!

266
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,790
The blood in our veins is different

267
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,460
from that of small humans who
happen to be a bit bigger than others.

268
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm not gonna let even a single person pass!

269
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,840
Me, neither!

270
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,510
D... D-D-Don't get cold feet! Don't give up!

271
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,690
That's right! Big Bro Franky is
on the other side of that gate!

272
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,570
Show them a fight worthy
of Bro's name, Franky Family!

273
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,620
"Main Gate"

274
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,660
Two more minutes...

275
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,710
Ribbit!

276
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,050
"Main Island Front Gate"
"Main Gate"

277
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,970
"Courthouse"
"Main Island Front Gate"

278
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,480
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.

279
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,650
How many friends did you bring?

280
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,400
There are 10,000 soldiers in Enies Lobby!

281
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,820
Yeah, I'm by myself.

282
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Get out of my way!

283
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,180
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

284
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

285
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,220
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

286
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,230
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

287
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,520
We'll become No. 1

288
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

289
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,570
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

290
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,740
an era created by risking everything

291
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,860
We always try our best, let's go!

292
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,870
If we want to achieve glory,

293
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,280
now is the time--don't be afraid

294
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

295
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,170
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

296
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,130
We can take off with unknown powers

297
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,380
We don't fear, and we don't waver

298
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,180
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

299
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

300
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

301
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,350
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

302
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,360
Charge ahead

303
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,270
Let's start running towards tomorrow

304
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,240
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

305
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,620
We're not gonna let even
an ant pass through this gate!

306
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,330
If you don't give up and go back,
we're gonna stomp on you!

307
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,460
Dammit! We can't afford to be delayed here!

308
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,220
Don't flinch! Open the path for Rocketman!

309
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,050
On the next episode of One Piece!

310
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,260
"Battle Against Giants! Open the Second Gate!"

311
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,680
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
