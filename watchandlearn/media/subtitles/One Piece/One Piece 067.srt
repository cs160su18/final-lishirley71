Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,860
"Deliver Princess Vivi!
The Luffy Pirates Set Sail"

22
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,440
Damn, they're annoying!

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,250
What's their problem?!

24
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,500
This can't be! What strength!

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,100
Unbelievable!

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,880
Alright, then. Let's settle this!

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,080
Yeah!

28
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,490
Knock that off!

29
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,930
What the heck are you guys doing?!

30
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,820
It's just a good thing you
managed to keep the girl safe!

31
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,930
You almost let a billion
Berries get away from us!

32
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,440
Understand?!

33
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,440
What are you talking about?

34
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,190
Why did you save me?

35
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,110
Right! We need to talk about that!

36
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,870
It's like this...
Won't you make a contract with me?

37
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,350
Contract?

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,530
Quit fighting!

39
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,660
Oh! You shoulda just said so, Zoro!

40
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,130
I just figured you cut them all down

41
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,830
'cause they didn't
make any food you liked!

42
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,960
Don't compare me to you!

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,430
C'mon! Don't sweat it!

44
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,520
Shut up, you two!

45
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,340
So there you have it!

46
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,090
As compensation,
I'd like one billion Berries.

47
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,050
You saw how strong these guys are.

48
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,290
It's a pretty good offer, if you ask me.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,220
I can't!

50
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,720
I do appreciate your
saving me. Thank you.

51
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Why can't you?! You're a princess!

52
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,610
One billion shouldn't be much...

53
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,230
Do you know of the kingdom
known as Alabasta?

54
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,000
No.

55
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,520
It's a peaceful kingdom known
as a great civilization and nation.

56
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,030
Well, it used to be.

57
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,140
Used to be? What about now?

58
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,060
It's in the middle of a civil war.

59
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,010
For years now, signs of a
revolution have begun to appear.

60
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,550
The people revolted, and the
kingdom fell into total chaos...

61
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,480
Then, one day, I heard the
name of an organization...

62
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,980
...Baroque Works!

63
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,230
I learned that the populace was
being manipulated by this group.

64
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,630
But there was a tight lid on
any other information than that,

65
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,670
and there was nothing I could do.

66
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
That's when I asked Igaram,

67
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,180
who always meddled in my business
since childhood, for help.

68
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,630
The old tube hair guy?

69
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,810
Tube? Oh, yes.

70
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,580
I asked him if there was a way
I could infiltrate Baroque Works.

71
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,590
Because that would let us see
who was pulling the strings,

72
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,070
and what their goal was.

73
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,270
You're a pretty high-spirited princess.

74
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,830
So? Did you figure out
this goal of theirs?

75
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,360
"The founding of an ideal nation."

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,820
That's what Igaram-san said, anyway.

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,270
Oh, does that mean...

78
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,100
Yes.

79
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,610
The boss says it's to
create an ideal nation,

80
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,180
but it's an enormous lie!

81
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,780
The true goal is to
take over Alabasta Kingdom!

82
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,710
I have to hurry back, tell everyone
the truth, and stop the fighting!

83
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,120
If I don't do something...
If I don't do something...

84
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,840
I see.

85
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,350
So that's the deal.
Now everything finally connects.

86
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,460
There'd be no money
during a civil war, huh?

87
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,150
Hey.

88
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,200
Who is pulling the strings?

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,150
T-The boss' identity?!

90
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,210
You shouldn't ask that!

91
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,070
You know who it is, right?

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
Don't ask me! Anything but that!

93
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,310
Your lives will be put in danger, too!

94
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,920
I think I'll pass on that!

95
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,650
After all, these are guys trying
to take over an entire country!

96
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,120
They're obviously
insanely dangerous people!

97
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,560
Yes! They are!

98
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,040
As strong as you people may be,
you'd never stand a chance

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,140
against one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea,

100
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,600
Crocodile!

101
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,470
Who, now?

102
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,350
You just said it.

103
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,580
What was that bird and sea otter?!

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,990
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

105
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,990
Are they going to tell someone?!

106
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,350
Hey! A Warlord!

107
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,460
Not too shabby!

108
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,950
I-I'm very sorry!
It just slipped out!

109
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,390
Like that really fixes things now!

110
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,420
Why did you have to
drag us down with you?!

111
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,030
Being hunted by a Warlord the
moment we enter the Grand Line

112
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,380
is too much to handle!

113
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,740
We're lucky we can see him so soon!

114
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,740
I wonder what he's like!

115
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,100
Shut up, you two!

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,640
It's been a short acquaintance,
but I thank you for everything!

117
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,740
Where are you going?

118
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,020
They don't know what we look
like yet! I'm running away!

119
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,520
Wow! That's so good!

120
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,890
I guess this means there's
nowhere to run now, huh?!

121
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,090
I'm sorry!

122
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,460
She's funny!

123
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,660
Where was she planning
to run to, anyway?

124
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,600
Guess that means all three of us
are on Baroque Works's hit list now.

125
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,820
That's exciting for some reason!

126
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,510
I-I do have 500,000
Berries in savings...

127
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,200
Fear not!

128
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,110
It's...

129
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,180
Ma-ma-ma...

130
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,210
It's all right! I have a plan!

131
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,780
Igaram! What are those clothes?!

132
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,600
You look hilarious in those, old guy!

133
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,970
It's idiot after idiot...

134
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,180
Vivi-sama. Please listen to me carefully.

135
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,970
Once Baroque Works's intelligence
network learns of something,

136
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,370
pursuers may come after
you almost immediately.

137
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,100
On top of that, if you
know the boss' secrets...

138
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,230
You know what happens.

139
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,820
A thousand or so people
will come after you.

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,130
Therefore, I will pretend
to be you, like so,

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,420
and sail straight to Alabasta
with three dummies on board.

142
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,590
These are us?

143
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,780
A decoy, huh?

144
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,790
While the pursuers are busy with me,

145
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,970
all of you will head to
Alabasta via the normal route.

146
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,350
Hold it!

147
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,920
Who said we were gonna
take the princess there?!

148
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,480
We still haven't come
to an agreement, you know!

149
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,740
Take the princess there? What now?

150
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,440
You haven't heard?

151
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,170
Pops here wants us to take her home.

152
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,100
Oh, that's what this is about? Sure!

153
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,820
Crocodile is gonna
come after us, you know!

154
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,990
Is Crocodile really that strong?

155
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,450
He's one of the
Seven Warlords of the Seas.

156
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,430
He's a legally recognized pirate,
and thus has no bounty on his head.

157
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,940
However, the bounty he did have
long ago was 80 million Berries.

158
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,850
80 million?! That's four times
Arlong's bounty! Say no!

159
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,320
Will you do it?

160
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,890
Yeah! It sounds like fun!

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,310
I am ever grateful!

162
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,990
Ma-ma-ma... Now, then.
I, Vivi, will leave from here.

163
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,910
That's a perfect imitation, old guy!

164
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,300
Imitation of who?!

165
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,190
Now then, Princess.
Please give me the Eternal Pose.

166
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,870
Eternal Pose?

167
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,030
You've never heard of it?

168
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,370
I suppose you could say it's a
permanent version of a Log Pose.

169
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,300
Whereas a Log Pose always
leads ships to the next island,

170
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,760
an Eternal Pose will never forget
the magnetic energy of the island

171
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,850
that is stored in it.

172
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,310
Meaning it will forever
point to that island alone.

173
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,890
And this one is set to Alabasta.

174
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,970
You're going to use this to go to Alabasta?

175
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,860
Vivi-sama. Please take the indirect
island-hopping route to Alabasta.

176
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,030
I've not taken the path myself,

177
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,820
but it should only be two or three
islands if you follow the Log.

178
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,940
Please take good care of the princess.

179
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,560
Yeah!

180
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,550
Igaram...

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,720
I expect it will be a harsh journey.

182
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,550
Be careful on your way.

183
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,340
Iga--!

184
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,200
You, too!

185
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,210
Let us meet safely at our motherland.

186
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,840
You must save the kingdom
by your own hand!

187
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,230
There he goes.

188
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,830
He was a funny old guy, to the very end!

189
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,260
He really is reliable.

190
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,660
No!

191
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,530
That's impossible!
They're already after us?!

192
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,560
He was a great person!

193
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,450
Nami! What's the Log say?!

194
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,790
We're okay! It's stored up!

195
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,140
Bring her with us!
We're setting sail!

196
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,590
Vivi! Vivi!

197
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,050
Hurry! If they find us,
it'll all be for nothing!

198
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,600
Don't worry! We will get you there!

199
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,630
I know they don't look like it...

200
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,760
Luffy! Go wake those two up!

201
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,730
...but they saved the East Blue!

202
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm going to the ship!

203
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,230
Just the four of them!

204
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,230
Alright! Leave it to me!

205
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,660
Baroque Works?! Crocodile?! Ha!

206
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,430
The Seven Warlords are nothing at all!

207
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,820
Let's go!

208
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,180
What the--?! Oww! What the--?!

209
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,390
What the hell're you doing, Luffy?! Hey!

210
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,090
My nose is coming off!

211
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,230
Let go, dammit! What's goin' on?!

212
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,150
Hurry, Vivi!

213
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,160
R-Right!

214
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,310
Karoo is missing!

215
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,140
A decoy. How foolish...

216
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,080
Hey! I brought 'em!

217
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,890
Get on! We're ready to leave anytime!

218
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,490
Huh? These guys are still sleeping!

219
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,480
There's no time to look for him!

220
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,580
But I can't just leave him here!

221
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,360
Still!

222
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,630
Hey! What's the problem?!

223
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,430
She says her duck is missing!

224
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,870
He won't come when we whistle for him!

225
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,820
This him?

226
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,640
You're there?!

227
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,900
He was here even before me.

228
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,300
There's a tributary just up the river!

229
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,170
We can use it to get
out to sea a little faster!

230
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,710
Alright! Let's go!

231
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,790
Hey.

232
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,510
Mr. Bushido...

233
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,270
Just how many people are
gonna be chasing us down?

234
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,120
I don't know.

235
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,990
There are about 2,000
people in Baroque Works,

236
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,750
and I've heard there are several
town-like bases like this one nearby.

237
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,360
They really might send 1,000 people?!

238
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,000
H-Huh?!

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,830
Hey! The ship's leaving!

240
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,470
Finally awake, I see.

241
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,670
Wait! Let's stay just one more night!

242
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,470
Yeah!

243
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,670
This town is great!
And the girls are cute!

244
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,080
There's no telling when
we'll have this much fun again!

245
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,030
Let's take it easy! We are pirates!

246
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,830
Plus, it's not even morning yet!

247
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,280
They have some nerve.
They don't even know anything...

248
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,680
Hey! Explain to them!

249
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,990
Yep! I just did!

250
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,100
That was fast...

251
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,820
Yeah, I left out the complicated parts.

252
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,390
We should be able to
leave the island soon...

253
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,730
Cool! There's fog now!

254
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,370
It's almost morning...

255
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,770
It's good we managed to
escape the people chasing us!

256
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,100
That's for sure!

257
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,040
We need to be careful not to
crash the ship into the rocks.

258
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,730
Just leave it to me!

259
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,770
Wait. Was that you, Luffy?

260
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,570
Nope.

261
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,660
This is a nice ship.

262
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,900
Who're you?!

263
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,320
Y-You're...!

264
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,890
I ran into Mr. 8 a short while ago,

265
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,590
Miss Wednesday.

266
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,180
You killed Igaram!

267
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,810
Who cares about that?!

268
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,440
What're you doing on this ship?!
Who are you?!

269
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,010
What are you doing here...

270
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,660
...Miss All Sunday?!

271
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,480
Miss All Sunday?!
What number is she partner to?!

272
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,320
She's the partner of Mr. 0... the boss!

273
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
The bo-- Crocodile?!

274
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,660
Is she bad?

275
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,220
She was the only one
who knew the boss's identity.

276
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,530
We found out who he is by following her!

277
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,940
More accurately...
I allowed you to follow me.

278
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,500
Oh! Then she's good!

279
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,310
I know that!

280
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,630
You're also the one who told him
we discovered his identity, right?!

281
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,760
Correct.

282
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,590
So she really is bad!

283
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,420
Pipe down, you!

284
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,240
What exactly is it you're trying to do?!

285
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,530
Good question.

286
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,820
You were all so intent and serious
that I found myself helping out.

287
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,430
The idea of a princess trying
her hardest to save her kingdom

288
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,940
while making herself
an enemy of Baroque Works...

289
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,530
It was just so ridiculous, you see...

290
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,650
Don't you mock me!

291
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,650
Hey! Sanji! You do realize
what you're doing?!

292
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,430
No, not really.

293
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,590
I just sense that my beloved
Miss Wednesday is in danger...

294
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,720
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
point such dangerous objects at me.

295
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,040
You don't mean...!

296
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,270
A Devil--

297
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,760
A Devil Fruit?!

298
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,130
Which one?! What's her power?!

299
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,130
Oww...

300
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,460
Upon closer look,
you're actually a beautiful lady!

301
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,620
Now, now. Don't be so hasty.
I haven't been given any orders.

302
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,770
I have no reason to fight.

303
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,000
So you're the straw hat captain
I've heard so much about...

304
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,690
...Monkey D. Luffy.

305
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,420
Hey, you! Gimme my hat back!
Are you tryin' to start a fight?!

306
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,660
I deem you an enemy! Leave this instant!

307
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,740
How unlucky you are...

308
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,430
You people who picked up a princess
Baroque Works is out to kill...

309
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,510
And a princess being protected
by a mere handful of pirates...

310
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,070
But what's even unluckier is the
course your Log Pose indicates.

311
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,510
The name of the next island is...

312
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,960
...Little Garden.

313
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,220
We don't even need to do anything;

314
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,090
you'll be wiped out long before
you can even reach Alabasta.

315
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,620
Will not! Gimme my hat back!

316
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,500
You wish! You big dummy!

317
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,010
What are you, a kid?

318
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,100
Do you not think letting yourself
get wiped out is a bit foolish?

319
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,870
An Eternal Pose?

320
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,850
You can skip past Little Garden with that.

321
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,290
It points to an island just before Alabasta:

322
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,820
Nothing At All Island.

323
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,750
None of our employees know that course,
so no one will chase you.

324
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,160
What? She's a good person?

325
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,700
Why are you giving this to us?!

326
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,360
It's a trap, isn't it?

327
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,130
Is it, now?

328
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,020
What do I do? I don't want to
accept this from someone like her.

329
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,440
But now that they've let me onboard,

330
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
taking the safest route might be best...

331
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,360
Who cares about that?!

332
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,950
Are you an idiot?!

333
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,420
She just went out of her way
to show us a nicer course!

334
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,220
What if she's actually a good person?!

335
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,690
You're not the one who
decides this ship's course!

336
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,870
I see. That's too bad.

337
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,770
Urgh!

338
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,820
She blew up the old tube
hair guy, so I hate her!

339
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,100
I don't hate high-spirited people.

340
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,750
If you survive...

341
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,750
...let's meet again.

342
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,710
No!

343
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,280
Let's go, Bunchi!

344
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,150
W-What is that?!

345
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,590
Don't tell me it's a Sea King!

346
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,670
No...

347
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,330
A turtle!

348
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,890
What a huge turtle!

349
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,010
I can't tell what that
woman is thinking one bit!

350
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,110
Then there's no point
in thinking about it.

351
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,650
We already got someone
like that on this ship, anyway.

352
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,860
Hey! Explain what's going on!
None of this makes sense!

353
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,150
Oh, Miss Wednesday!
Don't tell me you've joined the crew?!

354
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,820
Hey! Explain already--!

355
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,040
Whoa! There's an ostrich onboard!

356
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,480
C'mon, what's going on?!

357
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,890
Is it for food?

358
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,710
Explain what's going on!

359
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,360
I see.

360
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,940
It's too bad I missed out on it,

361
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,070
but there's still opportunity
for me to shine, too.

362
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,970
Don't worry!

363
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,050
Now that this sleeping prince has awoken,
your safety is guaranteed!

364
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,660
Whoa! Good thing I slept through it!

365
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,760
Nami-san. Jealous any?

366
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,250
Nope!

367
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,610
Is it really all right
for me to be on this ship?

368
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,450
I'll only trouble you all...

369
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,600
What're you talking about?!
We know who you are now!

370
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,620
If you didn't want to trouble us,
you should've done so from the start!

371
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,180
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,970
Right, Luffy?

373
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,200
Yeah! I'm hungry!

374
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,630
Maybe it doesn't matter at all?

375
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,810
For now, looks like our
next destination is set.

376
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,780
Little Garden, huh?

377
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,380
H-Hey, now! Will we be alright there?!

378
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,050
Who knows? Let's go, men!

379
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,590
Yeah!

380
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,000
It'll be quite the sight...

381
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,730
Little Garden...

382
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

383
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

384
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

385
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

386
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,170
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

387
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

388
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

389
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

390
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

391
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

392
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

393
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

394
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,350
Next is Little Garden!
What do you think it's like?!

395
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,420
But we need to hurry to Alabasta!

396
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,700
Oh, that reminds me of him!

397
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,320
"Him"?

398
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,790
A friend of mine named Coby!

399
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,330
The guy at that axe-hand navy freak's place?

400
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,790
Axe-hand?! You mean Morgan?

401
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,850
Think he's still at that guy's place?

402
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,530
On the next episode of One Piece!

403
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,730
"Try Hard, Coby!
Coby-Meppo's Struggles in the Navy"

404
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
