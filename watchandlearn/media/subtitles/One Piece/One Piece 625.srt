Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,550
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,460
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,440
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,610

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,390
we go!

68
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

74
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,570
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,490
The Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

78
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,660
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,750
and were drawn into a climactic
battle on Punk Hazard

80
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,300
which ended with Caesar's capture.

81
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,810
Then, they left the island
along with their pirate ally -

82
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,870
the Warlord - Law. However...

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,040
Law is different but Straw Hat
is just an ordinary pirate.

84
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,440
Where did they go, you bastards?!

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,480
Come to think of it,

86
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,100
you were talking on the
Transponder Snail earlier.

87
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,920
Who were you talking to?

88
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,450
That was Doflamingo.

89
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,400
His underground alias is Joker.

90
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,860
And Joker's most important
business partner now is...

91
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,860
...one of the Four Emperor -
Kaido, the King of the Beasts.

92
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,870
Our target.

93
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,940
There is no way to find
out who knows what.

94
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,050
That's why, Law, Straw
Hat, and you soldiers,

95
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,730
I'm gonna kill you all!

96
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,920
No!

97
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,120
Whoa-whoa.

98
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,200
Excuse me, young man.

99
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,670
Could you step aside?

100
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,770
He is my...

101
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,500
...friend.

102
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,090
"Intense!
Aokiji vs. Doflamingo!"

103
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,270
Is that the former admiral - Aokiji?!

104
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,780
I thought he disappeared
after Akainu beat him!

105
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,470
Young Master!

106
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,910
Young Master-sama!

107
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,250
Th-Thank god-dasuyan!

108
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,310
He didn't get frozen to the bone!

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,300
Young Master-sama!

110
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,550
Smo-yan!

111
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm not interested in fighting you.

112
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,640
But if I can't silence that guy,

113
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,260
I have to change my plan.

114
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,010
Can I ask you something?

115
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,660
What is your...

116
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,600
...current status, Kuzan?!

117
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,810
Your reputation is sullied.

118
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,430
Hey, treat him already!

119
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,280
Y-Yes, sir!

120
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,310
There is a difference between
the look of an ordinary vagabond

121
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,730
and that of a determined man.

122
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,560
I never thought that the World
Government was almighty.

123
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,190
There are things I can do
without belonging to the Navy.

124
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,400
There are things I can see now
because I'm not part of the Navy.

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,970
I was dead for a moment.

126
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,650
Maybe I was fated to come here.

127
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,940
What brought you here?

128
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,280
I came here to see you.

129
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,710
How did you know that I'd be here?

130
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,620
Don't tell me

131
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,900
you have something to do with
the underground community now.

132
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,330
Th-The former admiral has
something to do with...

133
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,890
If you're done with the
treatment, go away!

134
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,950
I'm still me, Smoker.

135
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,610
Then I have no qualms.

136
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,070
Anyway, you guys should
keep an eye on Doflamingo.

137
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,990
He's a Warlord and the
king of Dressrosa.

138
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,080
He's an unusual pirate in many ways,

139
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,280
but not like the Snake Princess of the Kuja.

140
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,000
Tell Sakazuki and get the
admirals into action.

141
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,290
In the worst-case scenario,
things could go very wrong, very quickly,

142
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,790
and it would become the most
serious matter Sakazuki faced

143
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,330
since taking over Navy HQ.

144
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,220
I warned you.

145
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,200
Hey, guys!

146
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,530
You have to keep it...

147
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,840
I mean, you know.

148
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,260
What was it?

149
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,720
I forgot. Who cares.

150
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,030
Yes, we'll keep it
secret that we saw you!

151
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,100
Doflamingo.

152
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,080
Joker.

153
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,140
His underground alias is Joker.

154
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,720
And Joker's most important
business partner now is...

155
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,920
...one of the Four Emperor -
Kaido, the King of the Beasts.

156
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,320
Our target.

157
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,930
What?! K-Kaido?!

158
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,480
Kaido?!

159
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,120
What's the matter?

160
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,530
Never mind. Go on.

161
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,510
Why is there a dragon here?!
Where did Momonosuke go?!

162
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,780
That's him.

163
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,060
Th-This dragon is Momonosuke?

164
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,320
Uh-huh.

165
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,640
What?! What happened to you?!

166
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
Kaido of the Four Emperors.

167
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,170
In order to take him down,
we have to weaken his forces.

168
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,820
Kaido is buying a large amount
of fruit from Joker now.

169
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,710
It's a Zoan-type, man-made
Devil Fruit - SMILE.

170
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,200
M-Man-made?!

171
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,510
If such a thing exists,

172
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,120
the number of Devil Fruit
eaters will keep multiplying!

173
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,040
That's right.

174
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,620
Don't say it so casually!

175
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,270
Since it's man-made, however,

176
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,880
it seems like there are some risks involved.

177
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,710
But, in fact, Kaido has
more than 500 Devil Fruit

178
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,630
eaters in his pirate group.

179
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,450
Who doesn't wanna do this?! I don't!

180
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,050
--I don't!
--I don't!

181
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,040
Shut up.

182
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,040
But Devil Fruit eaters
won't multiply anymore.

183
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,190
Really? Him?

184
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,060
Were you making a substance
for the man-made Devil Fruit?

185
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,010
How cool! SAD!

186
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,530
I can't believe it.

187
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,690
Don't praise him!

188
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,110
Is it that hard to make the SAD thing?

189
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,700
He just put Vegapunk's discovery
of "lineage factor" into practice.

190
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,620
So Vegapunk is the smart one.

191
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,960
He's just a piece of shit.

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,310
Shut up, you bastards!
Can you fools even make it?!

193
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,100
Don't ever call us "fools"!

194
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,470
Joker is finished.

195
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,290
We're gonna go onto the next move.

196
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,390
There is a factory manufacturing SMILEs
somewhere on Dressrosa.

197
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,950
We should just find it and destroy it?

198
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,280
That's right.

199
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,470
Then, Kaido's forces won't strengthen.

200
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,100
However, he's a professional
businessman.

201
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,190
I'm sure he'll retaliate.

202
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,760
Dressrosa, huh?

203
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,350
Is that where you wanna go, Kin?

204
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,900
Indeed!

205
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,200
They're keeping one of
my comrades prisoner.

206
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,900
Oh, something is falling.

207
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,580
What are those clouds?

208
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,390
It's gonna start raining.

209
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,940
It's not rain, it's hail (arare).

210
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,720
Oh (ara).

211
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,010
This is...

212
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,610
Nami!

213
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,400
What's wrong?
Is there something to those clouds?

214
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,260
Franky, prepare for Coup de Burst!

215
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,540
Okay, I got it!

216
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,510
Somebody, take the helm!

217
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll take it!

218
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,010
We gotta furl the sails!

219
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,850
I wonder what those clouds are.

220
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,130
Hard aport! Coup de
Burst toward 9 o'clock!

221
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,840
Head for an area with no clouds!

222
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,900
Alright!

223
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,960
No, don't! No, no, don't!

224
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,430
Coup de Burst!

225
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,250
That was close!

226
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,580
W-We're flying!

227
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,860
We got away!

228
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,400
That was close!

229
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,130
Thanks, Nami-san!

230
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,130
Are you guys trying to kill me?!

231
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,700
Oh, that was fun!

232
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,750
Momo, did you like it?
Don't you think this ship is cool?!

233
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,040
I-It is cool!

234
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,750
Nothing is impossible
for the Thousand Sunny that I built!

235
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,850
It's super, isn't it?!

236
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,650
It is super!

237
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,660
Momo-chan, do you wanna
look around the ship?

238
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,920
I'll give you a tour.

239
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,190
Really?! Alright, you may!

240
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,700
When did you turn back to yourself?

241
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:07,960
Let's go!

242
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,080
All right!

243
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,150
It's already late! No one has come!

244
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,420
Yes, sir! I didn't see anybody!

245
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,430
Uh-huh. Good job!

246
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,390
Thank you, sir!

247
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,140
Hey, do you think they
can still find us?

248
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,970
How many people are looking for us?!
Tens of thousands?

249
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,440
I can't stop worrying
since I heard you blackmailed Doflamingo!

250
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,710
Me, neither, you fool!

251
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,150
Kin gave us armor and some helmets.
Just let it go!

252
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,320
Resign from the Warlords
or fight one of the Emperors.

253
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,960
Nobody can choose between those options.
He'll just come to kill us.

254
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,990
I'm scared!

255
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,030
You bastard! Fight me squarely!

256
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,500
Stop!

257
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,970
I said it's a long story!

258
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,570
--Cut it out!
--Stop!

259
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,110
Come on! It's dangerous
to fight on the ship!

260
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,280
Oh, are you playing samurai?!
Fight, fight!

261
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,680
You should be ashamed of yourself!
The whole country was left heartbroken!

262
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,580
The grave of the Wano Kingdom's hero,
left plundered by a thief!

263
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,420
That was you!

264
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,690
I said I didn't do it!

265
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,960
You must have! You have
legendary swordsman

266
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,160
Ryuma's great sword Shusui on your belt!

267
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,500
Come on, come on! Fight, fight!
Just cut him already!

268
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,770
Who wants to eat a midnight snack?

269
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,600
Oh! What is it?!

270
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,470
Pizza.

271
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,800
Pida?

272
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,710
I don't know what that is
but if he cooked it, it should be good.

273
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,310
Momonosuke went to bed already?

274
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,980
He's taking a bath with Robin.

275
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,410
What?!

276
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,490
You haven't taken a bath
for days, have you?

277
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,750
Nope.

278
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,630
Did you get all warmed up?

279
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,490
Uh-huh. Not bad.

280
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,910
You came at just the right time!

281
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,310
Kin'emon-san, he needs a kimono.

282
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,080
What are you doing, you dirty brat!

283
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,220
It's not fair!

284
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,660
You're taking full advantage
of being a child!

285
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,890
Just cut off your top-knot!

286
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,020
Hey! Why did you gang up on a child?!

287
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,660
No, it's not what you think, Nami-san!

288
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,210
Men are all...

289
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,750
I was scared, beautiful princess!

290
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,080
Beautiful princess?!
Don't be so honest!

291
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,850
You're such a lovely boy!

292
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,560
You sleep in our room, Momo-chan!

293
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,860
What?!

294
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,390
They'll let him in the girls'
room - the secret garden?!

295
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,130
What?!

296
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,500
You're the worst, you brat!

297
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,590
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

298
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,660
Ring, ring, ring...

299
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,930
Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

300
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,740
Oh really? You found them?
