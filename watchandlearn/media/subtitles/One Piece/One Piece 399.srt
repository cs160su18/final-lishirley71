2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,080
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,550
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,790
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,410
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,630
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,970
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,480
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,650
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,780
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,490
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,290
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,630
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,380
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,110
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,720
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,610
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,690
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,410
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,300
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,450
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,560
Sabaody Archipelago!

51
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,830
Realizing that their ship needs to be
coated in order to reach Fish-Man Island,

52
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,540
the Straw Hat crew and Hachi's group
stopped by the Sabaody Archipelago.

53
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,410
It's time for the unveiling!
Take a good look!

54
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,470
However, Camie, a mermaid accompanying them,

55
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,000
found herself kidnapped and auctioned off.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,880
500 million!

57
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,720
I'll buy it for 500 million Berries!

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,120
Stop, Straw! You guys'll
get in huge trouble too!

59
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,330
You annoy me, too!

60
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,800
Quit your squirming!

61
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,580
It'll be all right. Just stay still.

62
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,700
Stop! Stop it!

63
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,250
Camie!

64
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,170
He took the collar off barehanded?!

65
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,010
Thanks to the help of Rayleigh, a coating
craftsman who suddenly appeared,

66
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,670
Luffy and company succeeded
in rescuing Camie.

67
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,350
However...

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,010
Alright, you criminals! Release
the Roswald family at once!

69
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,250
An admiral will be arriving shortly!

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,520
Gum-Gum...

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,850
...Balloon!

72
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,480
Repel!

73
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,030
Room.

74
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,320
Wh-What's this circle?!

75
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,660
Shambles.

76
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,950
Watch out! All three of 'em have powers!

77
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,950
"Break Through the Siege! The
Navy vs. the Three Captains"

78
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,780
Rescue team has arrived at the back
entrance! Now entering the building!

79
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,830
The rescue team has made it inside!

80
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,380
All soldiers will commence attack
as soon as the hostages are secured!

81
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:58,930
Yes, sir!

82
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,690
Hurry! On the double!

83
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,940
Rescue team has reached the stage!

84
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,380
There they are! Should we capture them?!

85
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,530
No, we can't! Our orders
are to secure the hostages!

86
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,580
The Celestial Dragons' lives
take precedence over all else!

87
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,760
We need to ascertain their well-being first!

88
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,340
I can't believe mortars don't
work on any of them...!

89
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,710
They really do live up
to their notorious names!

90
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,140
This is no time to be impressed!
Hold out until the admiral arrives!

91
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,770
Like we can really wait that long.

92
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,030
A head!

93
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,480
Hey! Don't drop me!

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,040
How are you talking?!

95
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,910
I dunno! My body feels
hot for some reason, too!

96
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,970
Body?! What are you talking about?!

97
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,830
This guy's body is burning up over there!

98
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,200
It's burning up! My body's burning up!

99
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,680
Huh?! You can feel it?!

100
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,250
Oww! Oww! Hot!

101
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,250
Someone! Pour water on it, hurry!

102
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,870
I thought I was a goner...!

103
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,090
Watch out, guys!

104
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,600
That guy! Don't enter the circles he makes!

105
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,390
Room.

106
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,470
Y-You mean this?

107
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,050
Yeah, just like this!

108
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,740
We've been cut!

109
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,570
What in the world's going on?!

110
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,050
Make yourselves comfortable.

111
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,910
This'll be over before you know it.

112
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,430
Third Gear!

113
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,740
Bone Balloon!

114
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,500
This is the arm of a giant!

115
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,880
Don't be scared! Ready your
weapons! Fire! Fire like crazy!

116
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,720
But, Brigadier General! Our weapons...

117
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,100
...are flying away!

118
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,390
Wh-What?!

119
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,410
What the...?!

120
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
What's going on?!

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,540
What is this?!

122
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:35,880
What in the...?

123
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,710
What is that guy?!

124
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,650
This is no time to be admiring people.

125
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Wh-What the...?!

126
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,950
Hey! Those are my legs!

127
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,280
Then whose are those?!

128
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,770
You have too many chests!

129
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,380
Don't look at me!

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,800
Giant Pistol!

131
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,220
Eat this!

132
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,490
Whoa, now! This, already?!

133
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,910
Amazing! I don't believe my eyes!

134
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,530
You sure know how to go berserk, Captain...

135
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,410
They're quite reliable, indeed!

136
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,820
What an impatient bunch.

137
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,140
What's with that, Straw Hat-ya?
That's not a very good finish...

138
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,850
Really?

139
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,890
Their formations don't amount to crap now.

140
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,740
Brigadier General! It appears all the
pirates have exited the auction house!

141
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,010
They intend to escape! Don't let
these runts make mockeries of us!

142
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,460
We have plenty more reinforcements!

143
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,500
The three hostages have been
secured at the back entrance!

144
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,170
Aim the mortars at those without powers!

145
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,860
Firing squads to the rear! We're
now commencing our all-out attack!

146
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,600
Take those pirates down!

147
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,760
Here we go. They got no plan at
all. It's a free-for-all now.

148
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,790
Oh! I'm back to normal!

149
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,450
Alright, Straw Hat...

150
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm glad I got a chance to meet you.

151
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,830
But next time we meet,
I won't show any mercy.

152
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,510
But I'm going to find the One Piece!

153
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,210
Hey, Kid! What're you
just standing there for?!

154
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,540
You know, Killer...

155
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,090
On our journey up to this point,
we've been laughed at and ridiculed

156
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,220
whenever we mentioned getting
our hands on the One Piece.

157
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,030
And each time that happened, I
slaughtered everyone who laughed.

158
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,800
But what lies ahead is a sea of death

159
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,480
for those who don't got
the guts to mention it.

160
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,230
Let's meet again in the New World!

161
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,700
Let's go, men!

162
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,490
Yeah!

163
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,300
Trafalgar Law!

164
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,840
How dare you toy with my comrades earlier!

165
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,840
Bepo.

166
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,980
Huh? You're going back inside, Captain?

167
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,870
Hey, Luffy!

168
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,710
Oh! There you are!

169
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,390
Alright! It's time for us to go, too!

170
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,110
Let's do it!

171
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,280
Alright! Bring it on!

172
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,960
Oh, Sanji!

173
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,340
Luffy! Look over there!

174
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,160
Hey! Young Master and friends!

175
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,860
Flying Fish!

176
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,670
Hey!

177
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,250
Eh? Did you just say "handsome"?

178
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,660
No. I didn't. Not at all.

179
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,830
Anyway, we're all set to escape! Right, men?!

180
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,470
Yes! Life is rosy!

181
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,350
I wasn't expecting help from them again,
but I guess we are in a hurry...

182
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,270
Alright! Let's go!

183
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,650
Guess I have no choice...!

184
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,650
Straw Hat's getting away!

185
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,860
Lullaby Flanc!

186
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,740
Escape while you can, you two!

187
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,780
Yeah!

188
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,620
Quit sleepin'!

189
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,830
Are you guys with those pirates?!

190
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,250
N-No, not us! We aren't pirates!

191
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,410
Nueve Fleurs!

192
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
Huh?

193
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,710
Twist!

194
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,820
Oh, that was scary...!

195
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,100
Head!

196
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,740
You have trauma from nearly being killed
by Navy Headquarters, and yet...!

197
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,030
You endured it anyway!
What a fantastic person!

198
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,350
Q-Quiet! This is no time to talk
about trauma or anything else!

199
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,620
We owe the young master our lives! We
hafta help him out of this trouble!

200
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,040
Multi-shot! Flame Star! Flame Star!

201
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,210
Colonnade Rose!

202
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,470
Old man! Franky! Go on ahead!

203
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,770
Right! I appreciate it!

204
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,020
Don't let 'em escape! After 'em!

205
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,820
How many of these guys are there?!

206
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,180
This is certainly exciting!

207
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,700
You're one lively old geezer!

208
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,050
Hey! Hurry, you three!

209
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,620
Yeah!

210
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,120
Don't let the Straw Hat crew escape!
They're the main criminals!

211
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,250
Fire! Fire!

212
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,800
What the...?!

213
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,010
Thunderbolt Tempo!

214
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,190
Why?

215
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,110
He just freed Saint Roswald's slave!

216
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,250
How did he uncuff him?!

217
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,960
Will you come along with me,
pirate captain Jean Bart?

218
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,930
It's been a long time since
I've been called that name.

219
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,530
If it means I can be free
from the Celestial Dragons...

220
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,310
...I'll gladly serve under you!

221
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,150
Give half of your thanks to Straw Hat-ya.

222
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,030
Don't let 'em get away! After 'em!

223
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,040
After 'em!

224
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,990
Alright! It's up to you now!

225
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,580
Leave it to us!

226
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,680
Yahoo!

227
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,500
Don't let them escape! Fire! Fire!

228
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:39,790
Damn! Can't this slowpoke cow go any faster?!

229
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,680
Actually...

230
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,140
...this is his top speed...

231
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,520
They've caught up?

232
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,460
Can't we speed this thing up somehow?!

233
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,610
They fled that way!

234
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,150
Don't let them get away!

235
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,660
They're still chasing us, even
after we demolished the bridge!

236
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,060
Of course they are. There should
be soldiers back in town, too.

237
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,420
Let's get the hell off these islands.

238
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,050
Kid!

239
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,340
Boss!

240
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,310
There.

241
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,690
Is that...?!

242
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,320
What's...

243
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,360
he doing on these islands?!

244
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,470
What an agile bear! He's too much to handle!

245
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,500
How is it even talking?!

246
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,920
I'm sorry...

247
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,220
He's weak-hearted!

248
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,630
Hurry, Bepo!

249
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,890
Crap! They destroyed the bridge!

250
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,820
You're a new guy, which
means you rank under me.

251
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,490
As long as I'm not a slave,
anything's fine with me!

252
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,210
Did we manage to lose them?!

253
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,170
Alright! Let's go straight
to the amusement park now!

254
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,710
Are you crazy?!

255
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,310
Yahoo!

256
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,720
How pleasant!

257
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,880
You're quite skilled to be able to
remodel it in such a short time!

258
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,930
That's for sure! You're
amazing! It's so fast now!

259
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,140
I do what I can!

260
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,630
This is where Peterman's hideout is...

261
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,840
Peterman?

262
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,340
Captain! Look!

263
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,510
Eustass-ya and...

264
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,220
That's...!

265
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,740
What is a Warlord of the Sea doing here?

266
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,260
Trafalgar Law...

267
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,930
You know my name?

268
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,860
Captain!

269
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,740
We're right next to Navy
Headquarters and Marie Jois!

270
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,160
Just about anyone can show up here!

271
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,120
Marines are coming up the rear!

272
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,960
This guy acts at random!

273
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,460
Trafalgar! Stay out of my way!

274
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,540
Do you want to be destroyed? I told
you not to tell me what to do.

275
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,000
We're running into unexpected
big-shots today.

276
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,830
I'd rather not add an admiral to that list...

277
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,980
...so you will let us pass...

278
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,790
...Bartholomew Kuma!

279
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,610
You were on the Pirate King's ship?!

280
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,750
But the Pirate King was
caught. How did you survive?

281
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,700
We weren't caught.

282
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,800
Roger turned himself in.

283
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,770
Huh?!

284
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,430
Would you like to know the whole story?

285
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

286
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,520
"Roger and Rayleigh
-- The King of the Pirates and His Right Hand Man"

287
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,830
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
