2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,040
Stop it! Saul!

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,460
Be prepared!

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,970
If you make an enemy of me,
I'll make you pay for it!

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,440
What's going on?!

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,010
It's Vice Admiral Saul!

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,490
Vice Admiral Saul, who deserted
with Olvia, is attacking us!

8
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,610
Why is he here?!

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,430
W-We don't know!

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,290
This is the end of this island!

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,980
Everything will be burned down!

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,320
Don't give up! Preserve the books!
We have to pass down the history!

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,710
Drop them to the lake through the windows!

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,220
It'll be better than them being
burned up and gone! Hurry up!

15
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,680
Now!

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Saul! Stop it now! You'll die!

17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,570
Throw the books out of the library!

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,520
Save as many books as we can!

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,300
Preserve as many sentences as we can!

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,780
So that our predecessors' words from
the past several thousand years...

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,850
...will reach the future!

22
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,750
Robin! What're you doing?!

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,980
Run to the evacuation ship while you can!

24
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,330
You can no longer survive
if you remain on this island!

25
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,820
Mom!

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,410
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

27
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,800
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,810
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

29
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,740
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,570
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,370
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

32
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,660
we will be able to make it through

33
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,920
Always!

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,590
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

35
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,560
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,600
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,190
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

38
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,500
We can't stop here

39
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,520
Around the world

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,780
Start me up!

41
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,490
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

42
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:54,590
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

43
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,550
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

44
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,400
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

45
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,350
Brand New World

46
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,810
Start me up!

47
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,270
"Say You Want to Live! We Are Your Friends!!"

48
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,570
Shoot Saul!

49
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,370
Robin! Hurry up and run!
What was your mom's wish?!

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,160
Live, Robin!

51
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,170
We're sailing the evacuation ship out!

52
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,430
Wait! Someone's coming!

53
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,840
That's...!

54
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,240
Ah! Isn't that the monster?!

55
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,250
Yeah, it is!

56
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,080
Go away, monster!

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,020
Hey! Don't be ridiculous!

58
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,410
Well... Wait!

59
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,860
Isn't she the daughter of Olvia,
a criminal, who was in the paper before?

60
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,520
That's right! If we let her on the ship,
it might cause us trouble!

61
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,850
Don't be ridiculous! She's only a child!
Hurry up and get her on the ship!

62
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,820
Evacuation ship! Don't let
that brat come on board!

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,860
What?

64
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,780
Although she's a child, she's an archaeologist.

65
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,860
She's a target of our attack!

66
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,430
Chief Spandine! I-Is that true?!

67
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,220
See? If we let her come on board,
we'll be in danger!

68
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,840
Robin!

69
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,880
That must be CP9! How absurd!

70
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,350
Chief! Vice Admiral Saul is coming this way!

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,360
Really?! I guess we didn't have to
ask Olvia about his whereabouts.

72
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,150
Fire! Fire! Fire the cannons at him!

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,510
Ice Block!

74
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,130
Partisan!

75
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,860
Saul!

76
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,670
Kuzan-san!

77
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,780
Kuzan...!

78
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,570
Oh, my, my...

79
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,910
It doesn't look good

80
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,210
if a Buster Call is blocked by
a former marine, now does it?

81
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,370
Kuzan!

82
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,080
Can you take pride in this attack?

83
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,420
Pull back!

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,880
This isn't right! You should know it, too!

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,180
This is a warning!

86
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,680
They're wiping out Ohara
to make an example of it!

87
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,410
If it is for the future of the world,
it can't be helped.

88
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,440
In fact, these scholars are
violating the laws, right?

89
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,600
Justice changes its form
depending on the position you're in.

90
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,720
So I won't criticize your sense of justice.

91
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,590
But if you're in our way, I can't let you be.

92
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,760
Ah! The evacuation ship got blown up!

93
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,800
Wh-Why...?

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
It was cannon fire! From one of the battleships!

95
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,340
It was from Vice Admiral Sakazuki's ship!

96
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,070
That idiot...!

97
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,110
If we're gonna do it, we'll do it thoroughly.

98
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,320
If even a single scholar is hiding
on that ship by some chance,

99
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,560
the sacrifices made in this
operation will all be in vain.

100
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,210
We need to eradicate
even the possibility of evil.

101
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,910
Is this something "justice" would do?!
Can you still keep your head high?!

102
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,660
I don't intend to go as far as that idiot does!

103
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,910
We're gonna run, Robin!

104
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,580
He's abnormally strong!

105
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,330
Saul ran away!

106
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,510
He's taking a scholar with him!

107
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,530
Ice Time Capsule!

108
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,350
Saul! Are you okay?!

109
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,020
Robin, run away!

110
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,190
Run with all your might!

111
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,450
You'll die if you stay on the island!
Sail out on my raft!

112
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,750
What about you, Saul?

113
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,880
This is it for me. I got caught.

114
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,580
Go!

115
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,210
No! There's no one on the sea!

116
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,450
Listen carefully, Robin!

117
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,520
You're alone now, but you'll
meet friends someday for sure!

118
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,180
Friends?

119
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:25,090
Right. The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...

120
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,150
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!

121
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,730
No one is born into this world to be alone!

122
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,650
Run, Robin! Don't look back!

123
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,690
When you're having a hard time,
laugh like this, just like I taught you!

124
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,360
Watch out, Saul!

125
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,050
Ice Time.

126
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,590
Saul!

127
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,570
Go meet the friends
who're surely waiting for you

128
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,010
somewhere at sea, Robin!

129
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,140
Live together with them.

130
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,200
This is it!

131
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,860
This is also the history that humans chose.

132
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,400
How thoughtless humans are...

133
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,740
I'm sorry, Robin.

134
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,590
I couldn't even give you...

135
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,880
...any parting words as a mother.

136
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,780
The Tree of Knowledge... is coming down!

137
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,030
Absolute justice can
sometimes drive people mad.

138
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,650
I've decided to let you escape from this island.

139
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,450
What on earth will sprout
from the seed Saul protected?

140
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,030
Who you bear a grudge against is up to you,

141
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,620
but for now, just be happy you're alive.

142
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,630
Live as quietly as possible.

143
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,960
I drew lines on the sea with ice.

144
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,400
If you just go straight on that
small boat, you'll reach land.

145
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,880
And remember this.

146
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,530
I'm not your ally.

147
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,310
I'm your enemy. I'll be the first to
come after you if you cause trouble.

148
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,190
My mom is on the island!

149
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,810
No one will survive.

150
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,620
If that pain makes you want to die,
you're free to do that as well.

151
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,860
This is the best library in the world.

152
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,390
Do you like books?

153
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,160
Today is Robin's birthday!

154
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,250
Happy birthday, Robin!

155
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,850
Be proud, Robin! Ohara is honorable!

156
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,400
We cannot give up the future
you young ones will live in!

157
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,780
So laugh. When you're
having a hard time, just laugh.

158
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,530
It seems stupid to laugh
when you're having a hard time.

159
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,940
That's not true.

160
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,980
Go meet the friends
who're surely waiting for you

161
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,080
somewhere at sea, Robin!

162
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,910
Survivors?

163
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,230
There's no possibility of that.

164
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,700
--Hey!
--Hm?

165
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,120
Take a look at this lake.

166
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,080
Th-This is...

167
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,780
There are enough books
to fill the lake completely.

168
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,450
Was this by chance?!

169
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,020
Yeah, this is the brat!
There's no doubt about it!

170
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,020
Where'd you find her?! Did you capture her?

171
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,990
No, sir! Keeping in mind to
look out for "a suspicious girl,"

172
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,070
we found a girl on a passenger
ship that was leaving an island

173
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,200
far northeast of Ohara,

174
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,770
but we lost her right after that.

175
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,940
She's got the devil's luck.

176
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,870
I definitely saw a brat escaping
from burning Ohara on a small boat!

177
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,030
I wanted to go after her, but the helm
suddenly got stuck as if it was frozen!

178
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,990
I bet Mr. Saul must've let her
escape right before he died!

179
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,960
To think that she can decipher Poneglyphs...

180
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,380
Although she's still small, she's dangerous.

181
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,750
This operation will go down
the drain unless we capture her

182
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,360
as soon as possible--I don't care how!

183
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,760
79 million Berries?!

184
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,510
Such a high bounty for an eight-year-old child?!

185
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,680
They said that she's a
survivor of those Ohara devils

186
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,770
who planned the world's annihilation.

187
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,730
Ohara?

188
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,610
I don't know how, but they said
that she sank six Navy battleships.

189
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,470
So that's why her bounty is so high.

190
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,250
I heard that the Government and
Navy Headquarters are going after her.

191
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,790
She seemed to have inherited the
ideology of the executed scholars.

192
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,220
It'll be a problem if she's left at large.

193
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,680
She is a child of the devil
who shouldn't be allowed to live!

194
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,590
Thank you for always helping me.

195
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,770
Sure. Thank you for letting me work.

196
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,480
By the way, before lunch, you have guests.

197
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,690
What?!

198
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,030
Don't let her get away!

199
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,980
Now, give me the money!
I reported her to you, right?!

200
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,450
She works very hard, although she's still small.

201
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,230
Oh? You're still up?

202
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,180
We have to get up early tomorrow
morning to go purchase stock.

203
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,340
Go to sleep now.

204
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,170
Okay.

205
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,120
She's a good kid, but if we're
with her, we'll be in danger, too.

206
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,090
Besides, look at this bounty amount!

207
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,550
Honey! She isn't in her room!

208
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,800
Dammit! That little brat picked up on it!

209
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,820
I'm sorry, but I don't have any food.

210
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,990
I know about you, Nico Robin!

211
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,580
I'm a wanted man, too.

212
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,820
If you do chores, I'll feed you.

213
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,740
--Captain!
--Contact Navy Headquarters!

214
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,620
Where's Robin?! Hand her over, dammit!

215
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,250
That darn jinx!

216
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,680
Your sin is being alive!

217
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,390
What?! Nico Robin is in this town?!

218
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,560
Find her! Hand her over to the Government!

219
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,980
I found one...! A Poneglyph...!

220
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,480
Don't come inside! I've got nothing to sell you!

221
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,790
I'm sixteen. I'll do anything.
Please let me be part of your organization.

222
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,740
You betrayed me, Robin!

223
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,030
Nico Robin. I want you to help me.

224
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,290
I heard that you can read Poneglyphs.

225
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,390
If... you exercise a Buster Call
right here, right now,

226
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,480
then together with Enies Lobby...

227
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,950
...you guys, too, will disappear.

228
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,440
D-Don't be ridiculous!

229
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,600
There's no way we'd be eliminated
by our own people's attack!

230
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,040
What're you saying?!

231
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,290
Twenty years ago,
everything was taken away from me

232
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,000
and many people's lives were ruined.

233
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,110
It was caused by a single attack--Buster Call.

234
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,430
That attack is now...

235
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,880
...targeted on the friends I was finally
able to find, whom I can be myself with.

236
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,540
The more I wish to be with you,

237
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,380
the more my fate will show its fangs to you!

238
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,170
No matter how far I go on the sea,

239
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,970
I have a huge enemy that I can't shake off...

240
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,940
...because the world and
its darkness are my enemy!

241
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,850
The incident with Aokiji, as well as this time...

242
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,910
I've already dragged you
into my troubles twice!

243
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,870
If this continues forever, even though
you guys're good-natured...

244
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,450
...you'll eventually feel that I'm a burden!

245
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,620
I'm sure you'll betray me
one day and abandon me!

246
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,830
That's what I'm most afraid of!

247
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,960
That's why I didn't want
you to come to rescue me!

248
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,600
If I'm going to die someday anyway,

249
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,660
I want to die right here, right now!

250
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,440
Robin...

251
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,970
Robin-chan...

252
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,250
Robin...

253
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,240
Now it makes sense.

254
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,390
I see! That indeed is a sound argument!

255
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,140
That's true. No one is stupid enough
to think that having you isn't a burden.

256
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,040
Look at that symbol, you damn pirates!

257
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,290
That logo indicates the unity
of over 170 member countries

258
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,420
spanning the four seas and the Grand Line!

259
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,300
This is the world!

260
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,270
Do you now realize how completely
powerless you guys are to fight against it?!

261
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,220
Do you realize how huge of an organization
this woman has been pursued by?!

262
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,190
I now understand well the
identity of Robin's enemy.

263
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,070
Sogeking.

264
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,170
Hm?

265
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,920
Shoot through that flag.

266
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,510
Roger.

267
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,510
Huh?

268
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,740
This is my new weapon,
a huge slingshot... named Kabuto!

269
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,720
Have a good look at its power!

270
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,690
Special Attack... Firebird Star!

271
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,850
Oh, no...!

272
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,520
Mission accomplished.

273
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,190
Th-They've gone and done it!

274
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,160
Do they understand what it
means to attack the flag?!

275
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,120
The pirates declared war
against the World Government!

276
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,930
Are you insane?! Don't think
that you'll be able to survive

277
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,850
after making the entire world your enemy!

278
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,720
Bring it on!

279
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,110
Robin!

280
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,430
We still haven't heard you say it!

281
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,530
Say you want to live!

282
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,980
Robin...

283
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,590
Robin!

284
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,840
To live...

285
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,750
You shouldn't be allowed
to live in this world, Robin!

286
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,970
Your existence itself is a huge crime, Robin!

287
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,930
I thought it was something I dared not wish for.

288
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,890
No one ever let me wish for it.

289
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,600
I want to die!

290
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,230
Right. The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...

291
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,400
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!

292
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,330
Believe in Luffy.

293
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,420
If... it's really okay for me
to utter my wish for once...

294
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,420
I...

295
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,630
I want to live!

296
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,810
Take me to the sea with you!

297
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You guys...! I love you guys, dammit!

298
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,130
Let's go!

299
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,040
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

300
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,960
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

301
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,090
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

302
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,090
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

303
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,350
We'll become No. 1

304
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,220
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

305
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,430
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

306
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,600
an era created by risking everything

307
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,730
We always try our best, let's go!

308
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,730
If we want to achieve glory,

309
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,110
now is the time--don't be afraid

310
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,030
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

311
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,990
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

312
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,990
We can take off with unknown powers

313
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,250
We don't fear, and we don't waver

314
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,960
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

315
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,000
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

316
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,970
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

317
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,220
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

318
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Charge ahead

319
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,100
Let's start running towards tomorrow

320
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

321
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,750
When I was a kid, I swore that I'd
gather a crew and become a pirate...

322
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,960
...like the pirate who protected me.

323
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,430
So, just like he protected me
that time, I'll protect you, too!

324
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,140
You're already one of us, Robin!

325
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
I'm gonna rescue you without fail!

326
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,900
Let's go!

327
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,220
On the next episode of One Piece!

328
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,980
"Jump Towards the Falls! Luffy's Feelings!!"

329
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
