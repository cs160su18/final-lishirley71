2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,350
After the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,560
Luffy reached the Maiden Island...

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,610
...only to became depressed by
his own feelings of weakness.

62
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,660
What is it that you still have?!

63
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,030
"Reunited with Dark King Rayleigh!
Decision Time for Luffy!"

64
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,680
CALM BELT

65
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,520
THE BAY AT THE CLIFF COAST
OF THE MAIDEN ISLAND

66
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,350
He stopped screaming.

67
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,300
Now that you mention it, I
wonder where Straw Hat is.

68
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,750
He's gonna die if his wound opens up, right?

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,790
I got one!

70
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,330
What's wrong?

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,380
I think I just saw a fish...

72
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,630
Th-That's big!

73
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,930
Look! That's a huge Sea King!

74
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,650
Is it fighting?

75
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,330
It's dead! It got killed!

76
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,640
--But it's huge!
--I couldn't see what did it!

77
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,170
It's scary around here.

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Huh?!

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,260
--A man?
--Hey! Who are you?!

80
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,930
Oh boy...

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,630
D...

82
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,480
D...

83
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,060
--Dark King Rayleigh!!
--What?!

84
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,770
Oh, it's you guys. We met
at Sabaody Archipelago.

85
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,200
He was the first mate of Roger,
the King of the Pirates!

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,250
Well, my ship sank in the storm
and I had no choice but to swim.

87
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,320
Storm?! The Calm Belt is always
calm - it's never rough!

88
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,780
There shouldn't be a storm!

89
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,510
That means his ship wrecked further
away and he swam all the way here?!

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,590
I have a good breaststroke.

91
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,830
That's not the point.

92
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,350
Then, that Sea King was fighting with...

93
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,180
...you?!

94
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,690
Only a legendary pirate could do that!

95
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,320
What are you sorry for?!

97
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,240
Oh yeah!

98
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,620
I assume Luffy-kun must
be here on this island.

99
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,400
Did you hear

100
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,460
THE CENTER OF THE ISLAND:
THE FEMALE-ONLY EMPIRE AMAZON LILY

101
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,040
that Snake Princess-sama and the others...

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,460
...have just gone to deliver food to Luffy?

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,510
I wanna stretch his body again!

104
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,260
They said they'll invite him
over when he gets better.

105
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
I can't wait!

106
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,260
I didn't expect to see him again this soon!

107
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,770
Men are interesting!

108
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,480
If I could become a man, my body
would be stretchable like his!

109
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,730
I can't wait!

110
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,570
Yeah, maybe I'll make
clothes for him again...

111
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,280
...without frills!

112
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,580
We're separated although we're newlyweds!

113
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,290
I feel like a tragic heroine!

114
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,670
"But Hancock... No, my dear wife!"

115
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,050
"Y-Yes!"

116
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,050
"No matter how far away from each
other we are, our love is forever!"

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,430
"Luffy!"

118
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,850
Oh, my sweet husband! My heart is aflame!

119
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,480
Like I said before, Snake Princess,

120
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,490
just because someone hugs
you and uses your name,

121
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,360
it doesn't mean you are married.

122
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
Then, what counts as marriage?

123
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,330
Hmmm... That's a difficult question.

124
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,580
You can't go to Sabaody now with that wound.

125
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,560
But I wanna see my friends
as soon as possible.

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,150
I have to be there just like I promised.

127
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,800
But...

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,680
Hmm? The submarine is gone.

129
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,680
Oh, Luffy-kun!

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,270
Huh?! The old guy Rayleigh!

131
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,900
I'm glad to see you this soon!

132
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,270
Why are you here?!

133
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,860
I was about to head to Sabaody
using the Vivre Card.

134
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,780
Did you see my friends?

135
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,160
No, I don't think they made it there yet.

136
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,710
I gave my Vivre Card to Shakky...

137
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,880
...in order to go anywhere I want.

138
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,090
Dark King Rayleigh! Is it really
you? I can't believe it!

139
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,090
You must be the former Warlord...

140
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,560
He's Jimbei, he saved my life.

141
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,560
What's wrong?

142
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,900
Well, I didn't expect to
see a living legend here.

143
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,690
Here. Isn't this hat important to you?

144
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,150
It is. Thanks.

145
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,160
It doesn't feel right without it after all!

146
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,250
Have you seen a group of pirates here?

147
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,590
If you're talking about
Trafalgar Law, he just left.

148
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,170
He said that you have to rest
in bed for 2 more weeks.

149
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,890
He saved your life, didn't he?

150
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,190
What a waste! We got that far...

151
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,560
I wanted to get in the female-only empire.

152
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,360
They were allowing bears in.

153
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,650
Shut up!

154
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,740
So weak!

156
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,790
I wonder what the Dark King is up to.

157
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,730
Whatever it is I'm sure that "D." will
cause quite a storm once again...

158
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,460
Can't wait to see him again.

159
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,590
Oh, Rayleigh?! You must be Rayleigh!

160
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,550
Oh, Gloriosa! It's been awhile!

161
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,090
--Rayleigh!
--Ray-san!

162
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,050
Oh, you two are here too!

163
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,890
Luffy!

164
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,100
Hey, Big Sis! How could you ignore
the man who saved your life?

165
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,850
You know the old man Rayleigh?

166
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,650
--Yes!
--It's a long story.

167
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,110
Luffy, so you're awake now.

168
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,360
I haven't
slept for days worrying about you.

169
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,410
You must be hungry. I brought some food.

170
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,410
So go ahead and dig in...

171
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,550
You can't even look at him.

172
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,290
How could you call it marriage?

173
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,550
Serve him...

174
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Serve him a meal already!

175
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,970
Jimbei! These are not for you!

176
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,140
You can have just a little bit.

177
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,350
O-Okay. Luffy-kun, why don't we just eat?

178
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,980
Luffy-kun, you have to eat. Eating is living!

179
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,380
That's it! That's my Luffy-kun!

180
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,390
Jimbei! I said "just a little bit"!

181
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,940
Thank you for bringing me
the letter from Shakky.

182
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,450
Sounds like she hasn't changed.

183
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,830
Yeah, she's just the way she was
when you were living in Sabaody.

184
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,830
She's doing fine.

185
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:17,630
These girls have become very beautiful
and strong over the past 13 years.

186
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,920
Rayleigh, Shakky, Granny Nyon.

187
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,140
You three protected us when we were
running from the Celestial Dragons.

188
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,720
But we have a problem.

189
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,560
We should be providing shelter
for Luffy from the Navy.

190
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,150
Even though Rayleigh
knows Luffy from before,

191
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,310
if it's easy enough for someone
to guess that Luffy's here,

192
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,150
we should be worrying.

193
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,960
Huh?! What an old familiar face!

194
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,620
You're Rayleigh, aren't you?

195
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,290
You just noticed?!
How mad are you about him?!

196
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,790
No, I don't think the Navy
can guess that he's here.

197
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,200
First of all, the one who sent him away

198
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,720
told me that he sent him in this direction.

199
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,220
Kuma...

200
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,300
I work for the Revolutionaries army.

201
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,310
Since I have a connection with them.

202
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,390
I wanna let them get away from here.

203
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,400
Oh, I can't believe it.

204
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,070
And where's Monkey-chan now?

205
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,780
I don't know.

206
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,700
I'm sorry about my abrupt manner earlier.

207
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,960
Can I talk to you for a moment?

208
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,300
I don't have...

209
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,000
...much time left.

210
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,920
Straw Hat should be...

211
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,680
In the direction that Bartholomew
Kuma blew Luffy-kun away,

212
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,970
there is the Maiden Island.

213
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,230
That's not all.

214
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,310
I found out some interesting
information about the War of the Best.

215
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,190
It's with regards to the prison break at
Impel Down by Luffy-kun and the others.

216
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,530
When I thought about how Luffy-kun was
able to infiltrate the great prison,

217
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,450
it dawned on me that Luffy-kun

218
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,290
must have stowed away on a
Navy ship with Hancock, but...

219
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,840
Since Hancock hates both
the Government and men,

220
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,400
I don't think that she'd
get on a Government ship,

221
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,760
especially not to help a man.

222
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,140
Now, this part is all theoretical.

223
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,810
But how about this?

224
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,310
Say that Hancock fell in
love with Monkey-chan,

225
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,110
everything makes sense.

226
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,070
Monkey-chan is a good-looking guy.

227
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,530
And if I were Hancock,

228
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,990
I'd give him refuge on the Maiden
Island to spite the Navy.

229
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,170
That's a very subjective theory, Shakky.

230
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,710
Women's intuition is unbelievable.

231
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,930
--That's my Shakky!
--She couldn't be any more right, as you can see.

232
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,060
Yeah? You like it? Good!

233
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,980
The Navy won't take action based
on a ridiculous theory like that.

234
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,690
So this place is safe.

235
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,770
Now, let's get down to business.

236
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,800
Luffy-kun.

237
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,760
You said you're gonna head
for Sabaody, didn't you?

238
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,540
I need to see my friends.

239
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,040
Is that what you really want?

240
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,190
Sabaody Archipelago.

241
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,610
Remember what happened to
you guys on that island?

242
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,400
Everyone focus on escaping!

243
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,040
As we are now, we can't beat these guys!

244
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,900
I couldn't save even one of my friends...!

245
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,920
Do you think you can face those
tremendous powers as you are now?

246
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,490
But I...

247
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,200
Do you want to be reunited with your
friends just to endure the same fate?

248
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,490
I have a suggestion for you.

249
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,530
Of course it's up to you to...

250
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,210
...do it or not.

251
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,680
Meanwhile, on the Bowin
Islands in the Grand Line...

252
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,680
GRAND LINE - BOWIN ISLANDS

253
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,400
Stop! Usopp'n!

254
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,820
Don't stop me, Heracles'n!

255
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,190
Usopp is...

256
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,520
...shaking his body which has grown huge

257
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,950
from eating an abundant variety
of food in the forest...

258
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,900
...and running.

259
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,500
It's impossible'n!

260
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,000
No, it's not! That's why I'll try again!

261
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,790
I can do it this time!

262
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,670
There you are!

263
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,680
Get out of my way!

264
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,100
Sure Kill...

265
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,930
Oh no'n! Usopp'n!

266
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,360
Are you okay, Usopp'n?

267
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,760
Damn...

268
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,830
You can't do that. If you try
to get off of this island,

269
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,290
terrifying living things
will stand in your way

270
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,500
and push you back to the forest'n.

271
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,180
Nothing will stop you from
entering the island'n

272
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,880
but once you've set foot on it, you're dead!

273
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,890
No one ever leaves this island alive'n!

274
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,850
And my name is Heracles'n!

275
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,050
Oh?! Usopp'n! Where did you go?!

276
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,580
Oh, he's in danger'n!

277
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,540
The sea creature has just
come onto the island!

278
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,750
Usopp'n is in danger!

279
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,700
The sweet scent from Bowin Islands
draws the attention of...

280
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,090
...giant insects and giant birds...

281
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,990
...and even sea creatures and Sea Kings.

282
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,390
It's a sea hippo!

283
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,980
I shouldn't get fascinated by it now!

284
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,110
The scents lure them
deeper into the island...

285
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,450
...where they find the
forest filled with food.

286
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,450
It's easy to enter the island...

287
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,450
But it's hard to leave...

288
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,000
Outta my way! Sure Kill - Exploding Star!

289
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,340
I'm gonna get out of here!

290
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,680
Don't get in my way!

291
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,520
I have to go back!

292
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,810
To Sabaody!

293
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,440
Exploding Star!

294
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,030
Exploding Star!

295
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,120
Exploding Star!

296
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,490
Exploding Star!

297
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,240
Exploding Star!

298
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,790
Usopp'n!

299
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,560
The islands are gonna move again!

300
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,850
What?

301
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,340
Usopp'n! Hang onto a tree!

302
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,840
It's happening again?!

303
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,430
It's gonna eat something!

304
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,100
The name of this flower that
looks like an island is...

305
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,550
People call them the Bowin Islands

306
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,500
but the scientific name is Stomach
Baron: a meat-eating plant!

307
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,670
Usopp'n!

308
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,840
What's the matter with you, Usopp'n?

309
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,310
You changed since reading the
newspaper that News Coo brought!

310
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,320
I...

311
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:30,470
...have no time to waste here now!

312
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:40,170
Luffy lost his brother in the war!

313
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:45,210
He must be having a very hard time now!

314
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,070
When your friend is having a hard time,

315
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:12,060
you should be there for him!

316
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,370
Luffy!!

317
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,270
Luffy's friends take
action, concerned for him,

318
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,290
but Nami is held captive by
the researchers of Weatheria.

319
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,600
Meanwhile, on Winter Island, Franky heads to
a certain place in search of an ice-breaker.

320
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,810
What extremely dangerous
button has he found there?!

321
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

322
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,490
"Back to Our Captain!

323
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,020
A Jail Break at the Sky Island and
