00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,420
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,540
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,480
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,290
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,620
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

83
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,330
On top of that, he put prices
on the heads of Luffy and

84
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,580
11 others, and now they're being
hunted by all the citizens.

85
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,880
And with the Straw Hats
fighting the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

86
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,840
Doflamingo stood in
Luffy and Law's way to the Royal Palace!

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,320
Isn't there any...

88
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,640
...hope left for me?

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,440
You always wanted to become a pirate.

90
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,230
But not me.

91
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,270
Anything was fine with me.

92
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,440
As long as I could...

93
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,510
...destroy this world!

94
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,200
Is that...

95
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,140
Roger that!
Pink Bees, the next message!

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,630
FIGHT!!!

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,380
I guess you need another beating
to understand things.

98
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,010
I don't know what's going on
but one thing I know is...

99
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,800
Friends don't lie!

100
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,850
--Shut up!
--Sanshita!

101
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,640
Go ahead, Straw Hat!

102
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,060
Leave this mess here to us and go!

103
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,030
Make sure to take him there,
Cavendish!

104
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,030
Hey hey,
I'm not public transportation!

105
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,030
We gotta win this war!

106
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,350
"The Second Samurai!
Evening Shower Kanjuro Appears!"

107
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,770
Don't let Straw Hat and the others
proceed to the third level!

108
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,730
Bring them down at any cost-in!
You guys!

109
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,290
We won't let you go any farther from here!

110
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,430
--Don't bother us!
--Go away!

111
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,300
You go away!

112
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,860
Destruction Cannon!

113
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,580
Damn! Those meatheads were
disorganized before

114
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,430
but now they've teamed up!

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,370
I don't like it but I have no choice
but to count on you guys now!

116
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,560
Cavendish!

117
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,890
Take Straw Hat to the Royal Palace
at any cost!

118
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,570
They're saying whatever they want!

119
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,350
Let's go, Farul!

120
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,220
I won't let you get away!

121
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,860
Destruction Cannon!

122
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,550
Your back was un"g"uarded!
There's the "G"!

123
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,440
Prepare to be shattered into pieces!
Mine Pop.

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,570
--He did it!
--That serves them right!

125
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,450
You idiots, just go after Straw
Hat and the others already!

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,750
Y-Yes, sir!

127
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,640
Armsmorphosis!

128
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,420
Revolver Girl!

129
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,760
I thought you guys didn't believe in
teaming up with others!

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,230
Garp's grandson is worth
bending our beliefs!

131
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,520
Here I go!

132
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,400
Head-Arms!

133
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,780
Hm? She got away?!

134
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,710
Entertain me, K-I-N-G!

135
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,010
Pistol High-Heel!

136
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,200
I guess a king's life is very valuable!

137
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,760
I couldn't get him...

138
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,660
Thank you!

139
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,180
Humph!
I just wanted to kill that bastard!

140
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,100

Don't lower your guard-in! Dellinger!

143
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,660
I was just playing with him.
I can kill him anytime.

144
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,790
Way to go!

145
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,930
As my allies, they're all reliable warriors.

146
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,380
--This doesn't mean I became your ally!
--Don't push your luck, Dagama!

147
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,680
Keep them away from the Royal Palace!

148
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,430
Bring down Straw Hat!

149
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,730
Secure the way for Straw Hat!

150
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,530
Yeah!

151
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,700
This battle... Now is the crucial point!

152
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,530
Looks like that guy is taking command.

153
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,250
He's annoying!

154
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,800
Daruma!

155
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,140
What the... Hey, let go off me!
You jerk!

156
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,320
Get to the top! Straw Hat!

157
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,310
--Shoot, shoot!
--Keep them off at any price!

158
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,090
Blade of Beauty! Saint-Exupéry!

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,210
KIN'EMON

163
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,550
So creepy.

164
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,140
Is there a beast or something?

165
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,160
It's coming from around here.

166
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,540
I said I can't eat anymore...

167
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,530
Could it be...?

168
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,060
What?!

169
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,780
Is it morning already?

170
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,340
How's that possible?

171
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,520
Somebody was in the wall?!

172
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,110
K... K...

173
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,280
Ka...

174
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,170
Kan...!

175
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,880
I missed you so much!
I'm glad that you're okay!

176
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,490
Kanjuro!

177
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
Oh, Kin'emon!

178
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,300
This is great!

179
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,190
Really!

180
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,690
I'm sorry.
I think I made you search for me a bit.

181
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,340
Some strange things happened
one after another

182
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,520
so I was planning to hide
myself in the wall for a while

183
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,250
A SAMURAI FROM THE WANO KINGDOM
EVENING SHOWER KANJURO

184
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,310
but I fell asleep before I knew it.

185
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,670
Anyway, Kin'emon,
I can't believe you came back!

186
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,430
What are you saying...

187
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,540
Oh no! Momonosuke!

188
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,050
Go after Momonosuke! Don't worry about me!

189
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,420
Sorry to keep you waiting for so long!

190
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,800
I trusted you so I didn't mind even a bit.
Don't be so stiff and formal, friend.

191
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,730
With my sorcery,
I didn't have a problem getting food.

192
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,230
Oh well, I'm not hungry at all but...

193
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,100
Want some lettuce?

194
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,710
No, I don't.

195
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,740
Your food never agrees with my stomach.

196
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,910
Well, as long as
you and Momonosuke are okay...

197
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,870
Yes, we are, thanks to you!

198
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,130
Good. I hope I can see Momonosuke soon.

199
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,510
Yeah, Momonosuke is looking
forward to seeing you, too!

200
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,330
So many things happened since I last saw you

201
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,250
but I can't put it all in a nutshell!

202
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,520
We have a lot to talk about!
I'll tell you later!

203
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,390
Okay, got it! Let's get out of here!

204
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,220
Get out?
Is there a way to get out of here?

205
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,730
How is he gonna do that?

206
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,810
Is he...?

207
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,830
Drawing something?

208
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,220
Come on out!

209
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,190
Spring Sparrow!

210
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,530
--What?!
--No way!

211
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,830
--His drawing started moving!
--Is he a Devil Fruit eater?

212
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,870
That picture of a bird came to life!

213
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,630
But the drawing is terrible...

214
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,800
Although his ability is amazing,
because of his drawing skills,

215
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,970
that sparrow doesn't seem
to be too good at flying...

216
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,630
--Now, Kin'emon, let's go!
--Uh-huh.

217
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,870
We can fly straight up to the ceiling
with this Spring Sparrow!

218
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,780
Wait a sec!

219
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,230
We're former King Riku
army soldiers and citizens

220
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,340
that had been living as Toys all this time.

221
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,170
We don't know what's going on
but is King Riku alright?!

222
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,380
Our families are in the town!

223
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,050
Take us out with you! I beg you!

224
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,640
Kanjuro!

225
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,850
Don't say another word! It's unnecessary!

226
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,400
--Awesome!
--Thank you, samurai!

227
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,810
We can get out from here finally!

228
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,020
Take turns climbing out!

229
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,290
Since it's a pictorial
ladder, it breaks easily!

230
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,160
The lines aren't straight
so it's hard to climb!

231
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,570
Stop complaining!
You've got a lot of nerve!

232
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,540
THE COLOSSEUM ARMY

233
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,520
THE ROYAL PALACE

234
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,860
Stop Straw Hat and the others!

235
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,800
Why don't you aim at us?!

236
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,600
Guillotine High-Heel!

237
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,470
There! I aimed at you!

238
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,490
Oh, the Longleg got beat!

239
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,110
Don't look away, Straw Hat!

240
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,580
We must get to the Palace where
Doflamingo is, at any cost!

241
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,620
I knew it when I heard Doflamingo's speech!

242
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,610
It's a game to kill me.

243
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,590
Kill or get killed.

244
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,970
Everyone in this country will become hunters!

245
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,390
The only way for you to survive is...

246
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,590
...to kill somebody!

247
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,940
This game called the Birdcage is all fake!

248
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,120
As soon as the weapon trafficking
and the secret with the toys were revealed,

249
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,380
all the people currently in this country
were sentenced to extermination, I think.

250
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,030
Doflamingo won't let any
information out of the country.

251
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,730
That's why he enclosed the island
in the Birdcage.

252
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,890
Which means Dressrosa is...

253
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,480
...is a solitary island,
cut off from the rest of the world!

254
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,860
Believing in miracles and
waiting for the end of the game...

255
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,280
...will get us all killed!

256
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,790
The only way to get out
of this island alive is

257
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,610
to move forward and kill Doflamingo.

258
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,250
There are a variety of troubles
in this country...

259
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,440
So many unexpected things
are happening around him

260
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,510
but it seems like Doflamingo is enjoying it.

261
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,430
I don't know anyone
who's more cunning than Doflamingo.

262
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,320
Doflamingo is a notch above
all the others on all fronts

263
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,760
but he made just one mistake:

264
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,840
He brought in all those
odd, tough warriors from

265
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,410
all over the world for the
event at the Colosseum.

266
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,450
We're not gonna be defeated!

267
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,750
Because, after all,

268
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,500
I will take down Doflamingo!

269
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,050
What are you talking about?!
I said I'm gonna kick Mingo's ass!

270
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,840
I said it would be me, Straw Hat-ya!

271
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,680
I'm very impressed, but I'm gonna do it!

272
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,260
Soldier! You said you wanna kill
one of the Executives!

273
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,860
That's a personal thing!
Taking back King Riku's country is my inevitable duty!

274
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,070
I have to put an end to the tragedy
that started 10 years ago!

275
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,280
If you talk about time,
I have a grudge from 13 years ago!

276
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,810
Then, mine's from 30 years ago!

277
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,120
Don't lie! There's no way
that you're older than me!

278
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,740
--You guys, get off!
--You get off!

279
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,670
--It's my horse!
--You told me to get on!

280
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,470
The road's ending!

281
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,810
Almost there! The third level!

282
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,270
All right!
Go straight to the fourth level like this!

283
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,240
Horse!

284
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,410
What's the matter, Farul?

285
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,840
What are those giant dolls?!

286
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,590
The group of dolls stands in
Luffy and the others' way!

287
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,180
Meanwhile, Pica who's been fighting Zoro,

288
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,300
throws a punch with his gigantic
fist aimed at Robin and the

289
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,460
others who're heading for the Royal Palace!

290
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,760
When it seems like his attack is unavoidable,

291
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,980
Zoro's never-before-seen
sword attack strikes Pica!

292
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

293
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,610
"A Hard-Fought Battle Against Pica! Zoro's Deadly Attack!"

294
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,640
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
