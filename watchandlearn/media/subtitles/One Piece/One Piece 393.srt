2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,820
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,750
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,000
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,640
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,210
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,800
Find it!

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,470
To reach Fish-Man Island,
Luffy and company found themselves

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,730
looking for a coating craftsman
on the Sabaody Archipelago.

51
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,760
However, also on the archipelago
are the Celestial Dragons,

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,980
world nobles powerful enough
to hold sway over Navy Headquarters,

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,980
and formidable rookies
headed for the New World!

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,220
But I'm worried about
the old craftsman guy,

55
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,330
if he's in such a rough town.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
My husband will be fine.

57
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,420
After all, he's 100 times
stronger than you kids...

58
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,510
"The Target is Camie!! The Looming
Clutches of a Professional Kidnapper"

59
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,660
Are you in?

60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,360
Yeah!

61
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,630
Well, take care.

62
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,870
Just so you know,
the navy is obviously aware

63
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,650
that big-name rookies
have made landfall here.

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,140
Th-That's not good!

65
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,110
Then, does that mean there's
no telling when they might strike?

66
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,280
But don't worry.

67
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,080
Perhaps this is another
case of rookie's luck,

68
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,970
but I believe Navy HQ

69
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,750
probably has its hands full
with something else right now.

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,950
Unless something especially
problematic happens,

71
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,390
they won't waste major military
resources on things here.

72
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,080
So, to be more precise,

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,140
"Take care not to cause
any trouble." Okay?

74
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, okay!

75
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,720
Got it! Thanks!

76
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,730
We're gonna go find the
old coating craftsman now!

77
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,100
Here's hoping you do find him.

78
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,760
We're here! Sabaody Park!

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,170
Yay!

80
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,430
It looks so fun!

81
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,760
Are you even trying
to find the old guy?!

82
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,710
But that lady did say
he likes this place!

83
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,150
Only if we couldn't find him
in the lawless area!

84
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,290
Wow! The Ferris wheel!

85
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,440
I've never seen it from
this close before!

86
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,580
Alright, guys! Let's have fun!

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,820
See, you're not trying to find him!

88
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,720
Yay!

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,370
Camie! You are forbidden to go in!

90
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,450
I absolutely forbid it!

91
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,960
Oh, it's moving at quite
a leisurely pace indeed!

92
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,040
Oh, what a truly wonderful view!

93
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,890
Yahoo!

94
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,340
Yahoo!

95
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,980
Awesome!

96
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,710
Let's do it again!

97
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,870
Were you scared, Camie?

98
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,810
Yeah!

99
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,170
It was really scary, but really fun!

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,660
My heart's still beating so fast!

101
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,400
That's nothing! I was in the very front!

102
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,140
We went so fast my head
almost wound up behind my back!

103
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,210
I-I thought my heart
was going to stop...

104
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,780
Though I don't have a heart.

105
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,750
Yes.

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,790
Gentle rides like this
are more my style.

107
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,170
Oh, what a delightful view...

108
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,410
Wow! Look!

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,910
Don't spin too much, now!

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,900
Spin! Spin! Spin! Spin!

111
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,240
Spin! Spin! Spin! Spin!

112
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,990
Spin!

113
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,000
Spin! Spin! Spin!

114
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,040
Spin!

115
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,230
What the heck's your problem?!

116
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,810
You idiots spun too much!

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Wow! We're so high up!

118
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,820
Oh! They're selling
ice cream, Luffy-chin!

119
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,070
For reals?!

120
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,240
Wow! Everyone's so tiny!

121
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,510
It's the ocean! The ocean, Luffy-chin!

122
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,410
Yeah!

123
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,470
Wow! Wow!

124
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,920
So this is how it looks!

125
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,900
It makes you happy enough to cry?

126
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,560
Yeah, I've always dreamed of this,
ever since I was a little girl!

127
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,140
I've never been so high up before!

128
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,700
I'll cherish this memory forever!
Thank you!

129
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,410
Hatchin and Pappagu
only let me come here

130
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,700
because you guys are strong!

131
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,990
My dreams as a kid
have come back to life too!

132
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,710
Merfolk and fish-men always dream
of coming here when growing up!

133
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,980
So high up!

134
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,840
So high up!

135
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,220
So high up!

136
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,170
That one next!

137
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,260
Gondola!

138
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
Let's go in!

139
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,200
I-I never thought they'd
be that strong...

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,870
Sounds like you had it rough.

141
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,000
So, what's this proposition of yours?

142
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,040
Right, Peterman-san.

143
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,410
I think the girl that was with
Straw Hat Luffy might be a mermaid.

144
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,130
When I think back...

145
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,640
Oh no! Camie! Pappagu!

146
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,900
When her shoe came off,

147
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,310
I saw a tail fin instead of a foot!

148
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,840
I see.

149
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,580
But these strong companions of hers
sound like trouble.

150
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,640
Even so, a mermaid on land
is a golden opportunity.

151
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,320
They're impossible to catch
in the water, after all.

152
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,750
Thanks for telling me, boys.

153
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,530
S-Sure thing...

154
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,600
For the info, you can have
10% of her selling price.

155
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,290
Agreed?

156
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,590
A-Actually, we were
hoping more like 20%...

157
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,860
No, 10% is plenty!

158
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,230
Wait here a minute, Camie!

159
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,110
Okay! Choose something yummy for me too!

160
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,810
High Priest Urouge. Look...

161
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,020
Oh!

162
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,100
A Celestial Dragon, huh?

163
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,910
To think they'd swagger about the
lawless area with nary a care...

164
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,120
This is bad.

165
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,880
Our only choice is to kneel
and let him pass.

166
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,270
Where on earth could Shalria
and Father have gone,

167
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,950
leaving me behind like this?!

168
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,340
We do know their final destination,
so please rest easy.

169
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,130
Hey, you!

170
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,160
It's all because you walk like a turtle!

171
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,870
You also sway too much and
make for a horrible ride!

172
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,620
You irritate me to no end!

173
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,800
Hey! Wait, you!

174
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,110
And why are you moving?! You're humans!

175
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,310
I-I'm sorry! Please overlook this!

176
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,690
He's losing blood and needs urgent care!

177
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,690
It's a race against time!
The hospital is just ahead!

178
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,110
Yes, this is very bad, indeed!

179
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,780
In that case, you must be swift...

180
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,840
...and be out of your misery!

181
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,750
Be out of your misery!

182
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,630
Please stop!

183
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,640
Oh no!

184
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,450
Talk about utterly selfish.

185
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,040
Which is more important,
courtesy toward me,

186
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,060
or a commoner's life?

187
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,800
Commoners owe their existence
to the Celestial Dragons.

188
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,830
Okay! I'm making you my wife!

189
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,880
Then I shall arrange to send her
to the Holy Land as your 13th wife.

190
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,690
Oh, and I'm tired of
wives #1 through #5 now,

191
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,850
so I'm sending them back
to the commoners.

192
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,300
As you wish, sir.

193
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,250
Wait! I'm...!

194
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:21,970
Stop! Please!

195
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,410
She's my fiancée!

196
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,900
Stand up in front of me, will you?!

197
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,710
Marie...

198
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,160
No!

199
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,920
No!

200
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,170
You murderer! How could you?!

201
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,800
Someone!

202
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,420
Someone please help him!

203
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,010
Someone!

204
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,850
They're even more screwed up
than the rumors say...

205
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,520
What was that?

206
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,270
Are you telling me off?

207
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,940
Let go of me!
Please!

208
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,210
Take her on ahead to the harbor.

209
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,980
Yes, sir!

210
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,990
Who's he?!

211
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,230
Captain Apoo!

212
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,290
He's an East Blue pirate hunter!

213
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,670
Why's he walkin'
in the middle of the street?!

214
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,290
Doesn't he know anything?!

215
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,060
He's gonna cause trouble!

216
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,510
What?

217
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,860
You need directions or somethin'?

218
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,910
Whoa! What is he doing?!

219
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,510
A kid?!

220
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,090
Brother!

221
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:31,350
Why did you have to die, Brother?!

222
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,480
Just stay still, guy.

223
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,600
Brother!

224
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,350
You stood up to a Celestial Dragon?!

225
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,870
Then it's only natural that you died!

226
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
I hit him?

227
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,440
I could've sworn he managed
to dodge my shots...

228
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,910
It must've been my imagination.

229
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,820
Well, as long as he's dead.

230
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,820
Why'd you get in the way?!

231
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,930
Huh?!

232
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,990
Don't gimme that, you idiot!

233
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,700
What the hell were you thinking?!

234
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,250
Are you trying to attract
an admiral to these islands?!

235
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,530
Tomato juice...

236
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,770
If you're a pirate, you must know
some of the unwritten pirate rules!

237
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,330
Don't get us caught up in your trouble!

238
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,060
Trouble?

239
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,540
Who are...?

240
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,230
Huh? Wasn't there a kid?

241
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,000
Are you even listenin' to me?!

242
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,540
You alright in the head?!

243
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,320
Oh, yeah, I'm not hurt.

244
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,050
You idiot!

245
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,520
I'm talking about on the inside!

246
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,110
You're a dumbass!

247
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,810
A genuine dumbass!

248
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,150
We managed to avoid the worst-case
scenario thanks to Jewelry Bonney...

249
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,070
That man is Pirate Hunter Zoro,
a member of the Straw Hat Pirates.

250
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,830
I heard their crew's crazy,

251
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,130
but attacking a Celestial Dragon?

252
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,700
That really is insane.

253
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,000
It's only natural he was saved.

254
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,250
I don't see the shadow of death
upon him at this time.

255
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,360
That bastard unleashed an absurd
amount of bloodlust for a moment.

256
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,710
He's a beast...

257
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,730
Worth 120 million,
yet only #2 on his ship...

258
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,080
He doesn't seem like the type
to play second fiddle to anyone,

259
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,300
but I guess that goes to show
the caliber of his captain.

260
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,920
Hey. Where's the hospital?

261
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,720
Hospital?

262
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,320
I gotta take him there.

263
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,440
He's been shot.

264
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,240
Huh?!

265
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,520
Forget about 'im! He's a total stranger!

266
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,220
What the hell?

267
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,330
A pirate that helps people?

268
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,900
Ain't ever heard of that before!

269
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,750
When I looked into town earlier,

270
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,220
I saw some bubble bicycle
things flying around!

271
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,540
Yeah, I saw! They're so cool!

272
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,850
Let's buy some!

273
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,500
We'll need to see how nice they ride.

274
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,820
Oh?

275
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,090
Could that be Nami-san?

276
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,600
Hello, Nami-sa--!

277
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,310
Hello?! It's me!

278
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,740
Me, Chopper!

279
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,890
Basically, they have so
many kinds of ice cream

280
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,390
and we got so caught up in it all...!

281
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,210
Hey, why are you freaking out?!

282
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,490
Sanji?! It's really bad!

283
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,640
What do we do?!

284
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,310
I'm not following you!

285
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,160
Calm down first! What happened?

286
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,490
I-It's Camie!

287
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,790
What's going on, Sanji?

288
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,130
Camie's been kidnapped!

289
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,450
What?!

290
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,310
A kidnapping team probably did it!

291
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,450
I dunno why, but they let people
sell merfolk and fish-men

292
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,010
even if they aren't bad guys!

293
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,650
Camie's gonna get sold!

294
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,590
She's gonna be a slave forever
and it's all our fault!

295
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,810
There are lots of Human Shoppes
on these islands,

296
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,020
so there's no telling
when or where she'll be sold!

297
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,670
We don't even know who kidnapped her!

298
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,940
The archipelago is too big,
but for now let's all split up and...!

299
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,470
Tell us exactly where you are

300
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,160
and then wait there.

301
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,510
Eh?! But...!

302
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,280
There are pros
when it comes to this sort of thing.

303
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm calling the Flying Fish Riders!

304
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,330
--Eh?!
--Huh?!

305
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,460
A young mermaid!

306
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,580
This one will go for quite a price!

307
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,510
Let me go!

308
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,740
She's quite lively, too!

309
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,420
Alright, let's welcome our
customers and start the auction!

310
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,730
We're sure to get a lot of high bids!

311
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,520
Save me, Hatchin!

312
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,280
Rescue Camie The Archipelago's
Lingering Dark History

314
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,470
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
