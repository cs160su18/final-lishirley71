00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,940
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,390
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,530
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,020
You should pay attention to the
weather forecast by a navigator.

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,850
Come on!

36
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,730
The one from earlier...!

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,900
Thunder Lance Tempo!

38
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,990
No matter how strong you are...

39
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,700
...my forecast is never wrong.

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,770
My friends are waiting. I'll be taking your key.

41
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,020
What're you doing, Chopper?! It's us!

42
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,770
Ahh! Stop it!

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,770
Hey, is that really Chopper?!
How come he doesn't recognize us?!

44
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,070
I don't know, but it must be Chopper!
Who else has those antlers and wears that hat?!

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,460
Step aside, you guys!

46
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,110
--Huh?
--That guy...!

47
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,610
Franky! What're you trying to do?!

48
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,740
This is one of our...

49
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,830
I know! Just be quiet.

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,620
This is the only way that I
can think of to deal with him.

51
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,800
Power holders have a weakness...

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,010
I'll push him off to the sea.

53
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,260
I'll go easy, so bear with me!

54
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,430
Coup de...

55
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,810
...Vent!

56
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,910
You bastard, Franky! That's reckless!

57
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,190
What're you doing to our friend?!

58
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,760
Don't worry. He discussed
this with me beforehand.

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,490
What?

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,500
So you're finally released?

61
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,460
You'd better stop laughing and start regretting.

62
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,920
Never again...

63
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,060
...will you get a chance like
you had earlier to slay me...

64
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,140
World Government!

65
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,320
"Hunter Sanji Makes an Entrance?
Elegy for a Lying Wolf"

66
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,480
Battleships are coming to attack!

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,390
Get off of Enies Lobby!

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,120
They're gonna start firing cannons!

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,450
Everyone, get off of the island!

70
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,580
We'll get dragged into the Buster Call!

71
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,950
We'll die if we stay here!

72
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,760
Stop, Nico Robin!

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,920
Even if you go back the way we came,
all you'll find are the corpses of pirates!

74
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,640
Enough already.

75
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,680
Teach her a lesson, Funkfreed!

76
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,060
Luffy is just ahead.

77
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,950
Don't hit her vital spots, got that?

78
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,700
Ivory...

79
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,050
...Dart!

80
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,760
I won't let you escape, you dumb woman!

81
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,430
Don't underestimate me!

82
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,220
Now, let's go through the
doors to our dreams together.

83
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,070
He went back to normal.

84
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,950
He'd better not be dead.

85
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,870
I didn't expect that even his friends
wouldn't know how to handle that.

86
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,200
Don't you wanna save Nico Robin?!

87
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,840
I do!

88
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,880
Well, anyway, the fact still remains
that he took out a member of CP9.

89
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,660
In consideration of your friends who
defended you even after you turned

90
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,730
into such a terrible form,
I'll forgive you for attacking me.

91
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,970
We'd better hurry.

92
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,300
But... even if I hurry, I still don't know
how to get to the Gates of Justice.

93
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
We'll be your guides!

94
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,760
Little ones!

95
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,250
I found Franky!

96
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,700
What?! You guys know where the
passage to the Gates of Justice is?!

97
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,610
Yep, we do! We're here to be guides!

98
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,880
Grandma's over there, too.

99
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,030
Tell me where it is right away!

100
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,200
And I'll give you and old hag Kokoro
instructions as to what you should do!

101
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,960
Roger.

102
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,330
He's unconscious, but seems to be okay.

103
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,410
You drank too much, old hag! Are you okay?!

104
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,490
Oh, no! I have to bring the keys
to Nico Robin as soon as possible!

105
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,320
You guys come later, too, with that deer!

106
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,710
--Okay.
--Got it! Go, Franky!

107
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,850
So, we have no choice but
to stop Chopper that way.

108
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:13,050
And then, after that, take these
#3 and #4 keys and hurry to Robin.

109
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,430
One of them might unlock her handcuffs.

110
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,610
If so, call me using this portable
transponder snail that secretary had.

111
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,710
Okay.

112
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,610
Leave freeing Zoro and Nose-king to me.

113
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,580
That's fine, but what will we do after that?

114
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,390
We've come this far, but even if
we're able to rescue Nico Robin,

115
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,450
there's still no bridge between this tower
and Enies Lobby. So we can't go back.

116
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,020
Yeah...

117
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,110
Now that a Buster Call has been requested,

118
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,230
we don't have time to go back
the way we came in the first place.

119
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,790
Then...

120
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,960
So there's no question about it, right?

121
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,590
Behind us is a deadly waterfall.
Ahead of us is a mysterious path.

122
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,820
Which would you pick?

123
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,220
Well, ahead is the only way, but...

124
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,070
Then, when we're done with
what we have to do in this tower,

125
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,170
we'll all gather at the Gates of Justice!

126
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,170
As for what's after that, just leave it to...

127
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,770
--To you?!
--To luck!

128
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,270
Luck?!

129
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,890
We've...

130
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,410
...wasted quite a bit of time.

131
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,620
Damn straight!

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,830
I can't believe you guys have been
acting so dumb at a tough time like this!

133
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,850
That's because this guy was doing stupid stuff.

134
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,960
You both are super stupid!
Hurry up and get their keys already!

135
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,170
Tempest Kick...

136
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,550
Straight Line!

137
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,490
That's just as I instructed. Nice job, Zoro-kun!

138
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,120
Fight! Zoro!

139
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,140
You guys fight, too!

140
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,610
That long neck of yours...

141
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,150
You'd better hope it doesn't
become your weak point.

142
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,110
No need to worry about that.

143
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,160
The muscles I gained are strong enough
that I can even freely control my neck.

144
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,490
And bullets, too!

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,450
Nose Pistol!

146
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,990
Wh-What the heck?

147
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,010
To think we'd feel this much impact from here...

148
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,560
That made a square-shaped hole in a rock!

149
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
That nose is more amazing than Sogepp's!

150
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,940
Wh-Wh-Who're you calling Sogepp?!

151
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,550
And don't make uncalled-for
comparisons like that!

152
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,710
Well, at any rate...

153
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,870
--Eek!
--...Kaku's gotten quite
proficient at using his powers.

154
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,030
W-Wolf! I-I'm the one you have to deal with!

155
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,710
Hm? Well, don't get so worked up.

156
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,170
You guys wanna save your friend, right?

157
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,950
Th-That's right! I'll take your key!

158
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,640
Hm?

159
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,470
Huh?

160
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,670
Hurry up and take it to her.

161
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,790
What?

162
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,070
Go save Nico Robin.

163
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,270
Wh-What on earth are you...

164
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,860
To be honest, I don't wanna
kill people. I hate blood.

165
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,950
Hm?

166
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,570
Th-Then, I'll just...

167
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,660
...take the key and...

168
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,060
No! Watch out!

169
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,370
Ten Finger Pistol!

170
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,880
Don't let your guard down.

171
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,970
I'm a wolf. I get people off
their guard and chew them up.

172
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,730
Usopp!

173
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,530
D-Dammit! What am I doing?

174
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,700
What an unbelievable masked idiot!

175
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,910
Why don't you just run
around like you did earlier?

176
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,160
You're fast as lightning
when you're running away.

177
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,850
Stop mocking me.

178
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,830
Huh?

179
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,090
We no longer have that kind of time.

180
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,300
New weapon, Kabuto!

181
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,680
Special Attack! Sunflower Star!

182
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,760
Oh?

183
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,740
Oh, I see. Fireworks, huh?

184
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,530
Usopp!

185
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,620
Moon Walk!

186
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,830
Stop it!

187
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,180
As I promised, I'll kill you in
an instant. Die without pain.

188
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,930
Too bad. If you'd stayed connected with
that shepherd and had him protect you,

189
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,280
you would've been okay.

190
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,010
You see what happens when a
lamb wanders off all by himself?

191
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,040
He gets eaten by a scary wolf.

192
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,870
Now, this is it for you!

193
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,040
Hey, stop it, wolf! You bastard!

194
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,210
Don't kill him! Please! We don't need your key!

195
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,180
You fool! You'll die next!

196
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,140
Tempest Kick!

197
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,520
Dammit!

198
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,140
Now, die!

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Usopp!

200
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,640
Who the hell are you?!

201
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,840
A hunter.

202
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,380
Now, die!

203
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,680
Usopp!

204
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,870
Sanji-kun!

205
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,290
Sanji...!

206
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,510
How did you get out of that state?!

207
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,060
A bathtub fell from the sky
and the spell got broken.

208
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,510
It's probably because I got water all over me.

209
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,730
More importantly, Nami-san...

210
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,290
Didn't you fall in love with me again?!

211
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,080
I wish the bathtub had hit you directly.

212
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,410
Nose-sopp!

213
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,380
So now it's at the point where you're not
using any part of Sogeking in my name.

214
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,030
I-I'm sorry, Sanji-kun.

215
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,890
I...

216
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,890
After all... I...

217
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,280
You're still alive. That's all that matters.

218
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,230
Everyone has things that they
can do and things that they can't.

219
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,610
Sanji...

220
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,760
Look outside, both of you.

221
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,790
No way...

222
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,600
The Gates of Justice are about to open.

223
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,270
Robin...!

224
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,700
Once those gates are opened
and Robin-chan goes through there,

225
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,470
the sea beyond hosts a nest of Sea Kings
and we have no means to cross it.

226
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,990
Past that, there's a large prison
and Navy Headquarters.

227
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,430
Soon Robin-chan will be taken
to a place beyond our reach.

228
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,710
Oh, no... Luffy didn't make it in time?

229
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,260
Coo coo.

230
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,390
Dammit! I can't get through here!
When Robin's waiting for me...!

231
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,940
Give it up. You'll never see her again.

232
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,530
You can't go beyond these doors.

233
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,960
Gum-Gum...

234
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,590
...Gatling!

235
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,500
That attack doesn't work on me.

236
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,320
Now, come!

237
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,990
I said come! We're going to the bridge!

238
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,420
Am I gonna make it in time?

239
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,460
I hope either the #3 or #4 key frees Nico Robin!

240
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,050
Anyway, I have to stop them at any cost!

241
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,200
It's this way!

242
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,130
Is it this way?

243
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,120
--Chimney! Hurry up!
--It's this way!

244
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,970
--This tower will get hit by cannon fire, too.
--Is it this way?

245
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,210
Wait, Grandma! They'll get
lost if I don't put guide marks.

246
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,830
Picking me as your opponent
was your downfall, huh?

247
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,460
If you were fighting Jabra, you might've
had a slight chance of winning.

248
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,390
When you see... those guys, tell them...

249
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,390
"You guys're fired."

250
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,980
Sure will.

251
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,820
No, I'm glad it's you.

252
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,570
Enough with your bluffing.

253
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,140
Hurry!

254
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,530
Get out of here!

255
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,420
Hey! Let us get on board!

256
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,130
That's not possible! The sea train is full!

257
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,970
Get some ships from the outlying island!

258
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,970
You bastard! I thought you were strangely calm!

259
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,010
So you pretended to be
tied up using your own rope?!

260
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,270
Yeah. I was waiting for a chance.

261
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,860
You were waiting?! When the
island is about to be burned down

262
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,980
and we were all left behind?!

263
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,280
To put it another way, we could escape
from the Navy because of that, right?

264
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,870
Don't be so calm, Galley-La!

265
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,780
They said Buster Call or something.

266
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,120
Considering how panicky they got,
there's only a little time left.

267
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,300
What about Big Bro Franky?
What about the Straw Hats?

268
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,800
Those people are unstoppable!
They don't need us to worry about them!

269
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,760
We're gonna hurry up
and escape from this island!

270
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,220
Yeah!

271
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,930
"Navy"

272
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,730
Ten battleships have set sail for
the judicial island, Enies Lobby!

273
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,310
The situation couldn't be worse.

274
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,080
But in the worst situation,
there's always a chance.

275
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,460
Sanji...

276
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,080
Leave getting his key to me.

277
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,550
Are you changing fighters? That's fine by me.

278
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,510
I'll do what you can't do.

279
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,220
And you do what I can't do!

280
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,500
What?

281
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,390
Think carefully.

282
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,190
Grasp the situation!

283
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,110
As long as we have you, we can
save Robin-chan for sure! Usopp!

284
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,490
I want to live!

285
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,380
Wh-What I can do...

286
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,400
If you have time to sympathize
with that stupid woman, Nico Robin,

287
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,260
why don't you think of a way to
save your neck here or something?!

288
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,220
Watch your mouth.

289
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,850
Listen good. I'm the kind
who heats up with anger.

290
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,120
On the next episode of One Piece!

291
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,650
"Fiery Kicks! Sanji's Full
Course of Foot Techniques"

292
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
