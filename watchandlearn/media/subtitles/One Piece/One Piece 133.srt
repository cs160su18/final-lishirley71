2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,390
Simmer three nights and two days,
to take off the bitter edge...

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,610
Nami-san and Robin-chan, just you wait!

21
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,440
This is a special breakfast!

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,460
"A Recipe Handed Down!
Sanji, the Iron Man of Curry"

23
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,890
Damn,

24
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,320
it's like milk got spilled into this fog.
I can't see ahead of us.

25
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,050
Luffy, do you see anything?

26
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,060
Hey, I see something!

27
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,320
Oh, no! There's a giant ship in front of us!

28
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,200
Sanji-kun! The helm! Hard to starboard!

29
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,270
Here, Nami-san!

30
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,600
It's Sanji's specially made love--

31
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,340
T-This is bad!

32
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,310
We're surrounded
by the navy, aren't we?!

33
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,430
Awesome!

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,080
Not even the navy can move
around in this kind of fog, huh?

35
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,940
It might be best for us to escape
under cover of this thick fog.

36
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,560
You're right.

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Keep heading forward.
Everyone, keep quiet.

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,570
Especially you, Luffy.

39
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,350
Right!

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,220
Nami-san...

41
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,430
Please, wait a minute.

42
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,070
A child? I wonder what he's doing.

43
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,040
Look out!

44
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,120
Allow me.

45
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,920
He's okay now. The smelling
salts appear to be working.

46
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,670
W-Where am I?

47
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,140
You're on the ship of the Luffy Pirates.

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,730
P-Pirates?!

49
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,760
Yeah.

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,610
Do you remember?
You fell overboard from a navy ship.

51
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,660
S-Stay back! You're planning
to attack the navy, aren't you?!

52
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,310
What's with him? And after
we rescued him, too.

53
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,390
You can't blame him. He's a marine.

54
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,710
First, eat something.

55
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,340
I don't want it! I don't need any pirate help!

56
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,070
Ha, you won't have any soup made
by the cook on a pirate ship, huh?

57
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,340
It's not poisoned, or anything.

58
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,280
You'll settle down, once you've got
a little something in your stomach.

59
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,070
This soup is amazing!

60
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,950
Imagine, consommé, as clear as this!

61
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,730
Thanks, that was good.

62
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,840
Sure, you're welcome.

63
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,930
I'm Tajio. I'm a probationary
cook for the navy.

64
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,420
I'm Sanji.

65
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,120
Yeah, you're a cook, are you?

66
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,960
Sanji-san, you're so good!

67
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,840
Too good to be a pirate cook
on a run-down ship like this!

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,180
What did you say?!
This ship is not run-down!

69
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,570
Yeah! This ship is from Syrup Village,
where I used to live--

70
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,670
Is it sweet?

71
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,980
No, not like that. And there
was this girl, named Kaya,

72
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,150
--Now, now, now, take it easy...
--who gave us this ship,
so it's very dear to us!

73
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,790
As it happens, I...

74
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,160
I spilled the curry that
they were having for lunch.

75
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,250
I'm sorry!

76
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,100
You make it.

77
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,110
You spilled it, right?

78
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,500
So if you're really sorry about it,

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,690
then you make the curry again,
in time for lunch.

80
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,740
The chef was right. No question.

81
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,930
Uh-huh.

82
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,410
So then, I've tried
making it again and again,

83
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,950
but it doesn't turn out right.

84
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,610
Tajio-kun, do you have
any experience cooking?

85
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,140
I only started being a
probationary cook six months ago.

86
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,610
Six months should be plenty.

87
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,850
No, I can't! All I do every day
is wash dishes and peel things!

88
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,390
I still haven't actually made any food!

89
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,540
What's worse...

90
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,970
All of the ships' captains have a custom

91
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,520
of getting together once a week,
and having curry for lunch.

92
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,460
This week, it's my ship's turn to host it.

93
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,560
How is my curry supposed to meet
the tastes of the navy's big shots?

94
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,220
The navy's curry is famous.

95
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,110
I hear the chef on each ship
competes with all the others,

96
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,560
and each one has their
own flavor for their ship.

97
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,980
Oh, yeah? That sounds yummy, huh?

98
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
With six months' time in the galley,

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,960
if you don't have any
confidence in yourself,

100
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,910
then go back and apologize
to your chef again.

101
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,680
No way.

102
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,410
If I tell him that, he'll put me off the ship!

103
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,890
Does it have to be that ship?

104
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,520
Is there any reason for that, or anything?

105
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,960
Well...

106
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,420
The All...

107
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you know about the All Blue?!

108
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,080
The East Blue, the West Blue,

109
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,850
the South Blue, the North Blue...

110
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,580
It's where all the delicacies from
the four seas are gathered together.

111
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,030
As a cook, it's a sea of treasures
that I'd like to go to sometime.

112
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,440
The senior cooks laugh it off as a dream,

113
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,350
but I believe in it!

114
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,910
I'm sure the All Blue is out there!

115
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,360
If I'm aboard a naval warship, there's
a good chance I'll go there, right?

116
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,740
So I... So I can't afford
to be put off the ship!

117
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,530
The All Blue? Isn't that...?

118
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,810
I would like to get away from
here as soon as we can...

119
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,100
Yeah, if we're spotted, and
they launch a salvo at us...

120
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,940
Then again, given the circumstances,

121
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,440
we have to send this boy back,
don't we, Sanji-kun?

122
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,300
I'm just taking him back
to his ship, that's all.

123
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,900
Luffy, give us a hand.

124
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,320
Gum-Gum Mooring Line!!

125
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,820
Hey, Sanji, I've got hold.

126
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,770
Once noontime comes,
this fog will clear up.

127
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,900
Later than that, and it will be too
dangerous for us to wait around.

128
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,420
That's long enough.

129
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,100
How much are you planning to help him?

130
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm just going to have
a little look for myself

131
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,320
at what the galley of a navy ship looks like.

132
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,630
Sanji!

133
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,970
All right, hold on tight!

134
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,840
By the way, why did you come along, too?

135
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,610
How were you going to get back?

136
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,960
Well, just wait here, and behave yourself.

137
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,820
S-Sure.

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,290
"18th Fleet Galley"

139
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,020
This is the galley.

140
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,240
Yeah. Might as well have a look,
as long as I'm here.

141
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,180
That's the navy for you.
This is expensive stuff.

142
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,080
What's more, it's all in good repair.

143
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,820
What's that?

144
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,300
It's coming from the ship's pantry.

145
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,220
That startled me...

146
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,690
Luffy! What are you doing in here?!

147
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,650
Sanji! Recon! I'm on recon!

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,330
A chance like this doesn't
come along every day, after all.

149
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,730
So, I'm just going to go do some more recon.

150
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,280
Do as you like,

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,800
but if the marines find you,
they won't go easy on you.

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,540
And another thing...

153
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,370
Leave what you've stuffed
down your pants here.

154
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,460
Apples, right?

155
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,300
This here is navy curry.

156
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,010
Back when I was at a maritime restaurant...

157
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,880
...the owner, Zeff,
never taught me anything.

158
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,740
Day in and day out, all he ever
let me do was wash dishes.

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,160
Hey, little brat!

160
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,370
You have to do more than just your hardest.

161
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,570
Use your head, and think about
why I let you into my kitchen,

162
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,040
then had you do chores for the
last six months, or the last year!

163
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,560
That's what Zeff told me, as I was
dripping with dissatisfaction.

164
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,030
I get it. Chef has me in here to
let me steal his cooking skills.

165
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,670
Cooking isn't something that can be taught.

166
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,690
Sanji-san, I'm going to try!

167
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Let's see... What was it Chef said...?

168
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,370
The basic recipe for curry is
powder, soup, and ingredients.

169
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,420
His curry powder is delicately blended!

170
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,260
That aroma...

171
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,710
They take ready-made curry powder,

172
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,700
and add in some freshly made garam masala.

173
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,840
Don't be so lazy that you use
the powder that's already there!

174
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,870
The flavor of a spice diminishes by the day!

175
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,890
It's the garam masala!

176
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,620
His sense of smell is true, huh?

177
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,070
This is huge!

178
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,820
In this fog...

179
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,930
...we won't be moving for a little while.

180
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,580
It'll probably clear up around midday.

181
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,410
By the way, did you hear
about the customary luncheon?

182
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,390
Yeah, about how that
probationary cook Tajio is making it?

183
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,170
I wonder just what exactly
he's going to feed us.

184
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,380
No doubt!

185
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,080
For the bullion, I can use
the ready-made stuff

186
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,050
that's thoroughly boiled.

187
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,510
Now, it's time to prepare the ingredients.

188
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,690
First, I need to cut up and brown the beef.

189
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,570
There's a type of beef curry
where the beef's juices

190
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,150
are sealed within the beef itself...

191
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,150
But from the mellow flavor of this curry,

192
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,450
this isn't the type that keeps
the essence of the meat inside,

193
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,050
it allows it to dissolve out into the soup.

194
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,050
In which case, this kid is
messing it up right from the start.

195
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,810
Is something wrong?

196
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,680
Kid, cooking is not something
you should rush through.

197
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,870
Remember, everything in cooking
depends on preparation.

198
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,890
It's vital to take your time. That is everything.

199
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,550
Include garlic...

200
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,320
...ginger...

201
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,710
...turmeric,

202
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,620
and add some yogurt.

203
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,810
That takes care of the preparations.

204
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,370
Next, I have to sauté the onions.

205
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,500
Smoking, where I'm preparing food?!

206
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,820
As a cook, do you think that's okay?!

207
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,980
Earlier, I said you were too good
to be a cook on a pirate ship,

208
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,770
but I take it back!

209
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,740
My, my, I singed my hair.

210
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,020
Remember, you first sauté
onions over a strong flame.

211
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,490
Keep them moving,
so they don't get scorched.

212
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,340
Once the onions are soft, lower the flame.

213
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,800
Go slowly and gently,
simmering over a low flame,

214
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
until they're golden-brown.

215
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,910
Got that, men?

216
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,530
Sanji-san was warning me
about the heat level...

217
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,020
Wow, this is high.

218
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,990
The view is
completely different, all right.

219
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,550
W-Who are you?!

220
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,380
I've been spotted!

221
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,650
Hold it!

222
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,310
I'm not holding anything!

223
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,420
Melt some pork lard...

224
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,380
...add the flour...

225
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,230
Gently, so as not to scorch it...

226
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,880
Put the curry powder in...

227
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,820
...and add garam masala,
to enhance the flavor.

228
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,270
Now, to bring all the ingredients together...

229
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,050
Add in the bullion...

230
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,400
The tomatoes...

231
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,810
Add the onions...

232
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,240
Then put the marinated meat in.

233
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,880
It's not right...

234
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,520
It has no body.

235
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,130
Sure enough, I can't do it.

236
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,510
Subtle flavoring...!

237
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,760
Sanji-san!

238
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,360
This apple...

239
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,210
...sure is sweet.

240
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,190
Sanji-san...

241
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,340
Thank you very much.

242
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,590
What are you talking about?

243
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,180
I haven't done anything
you need to thank me for.

244
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,540
Sanji-san, you just pretended to stop by,

245
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,680
but really, you were trying to teach me.

246
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,160
Don't get the wrong impression.

247
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,680
Over there! He ran over there!

248
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,350
Sanji! Let's go!

249
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,020
That idiot...

250
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,780
Hold it!

251
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,230
Gum-Gum...

252
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,950
...Mooring Line!!

253
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,790
All right!

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
I've grabbed on!

255
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,530
Tajio...

256
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,970
I think it's out there, too.

257
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,540
The All Blue.

258
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,080
Sanji! Grab on!

259
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,840
Right!

260
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,460
Hey, Tajio, there was a
suspicious-looking man just here, right?

261
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,440
Where did he go?

262
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,370
Huh? I don't know.

263
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,150
Are you sure you weren't seeing things?

264
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,110
Keep looking! They must be
hiding on the ship somewhere!

265
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,970
Find him!

266
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,440
Why, you...!

267
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,800
You have some sort of grudge against me?

268
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,070
Sorry.

269
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,140
No, that face doesn't say "sorry"!

270
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,200
That's why I'm sorry.

271
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,030
I'm gonna fillet you...!

272
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,000
What's the matter, Luffy?

273
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,680
You've damaged the
Going Merry again, huh?!

274
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,290
Oh, Usopp, Nami, sorry!

275
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,460
The navy saw me, so we had
to come back in a hurry.

276
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,860
Huh?! H-Hang on, what
do you mean by that?!

277
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,340
This is a precious ship,
that we got from Kaya!

278
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,690
How many times do I have to tell you that?!

279
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,740
We can't stand around like this!

280
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,890
Usopp, Sanji-kun, we're leaving immediately!

281
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,390
Yes, Nami-san!

282
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,660
Urgh, I can't move...

283
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,000
Serve it.

284
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,090
Yes, sir!

285
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,400
Please, enjoy your meal.

286
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,770
Oh, this is good.

287
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,480
It's just thick enough, and the spicy flavor

288
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,980
is spreading throughout my mouth.

289
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,380
The meat is so tender...

290
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,330
Another bowl, right away!

291
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,580
Tajio...

292
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,760
Yes, Chef?

293
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,880
Make sure you clean up in there.

294
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,310
Y-Yes, sir!

295
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,360
Sanji-san...

296
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,070
I think it's out there, too-- the All Blue.

297
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,850
I'm going to work hard,

298
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,080
and someday, I'll be as good
a cook as you are, Sanji-san.

299
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:17,610
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

300
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:28,240
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

301
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,540
There are days where I almost lose to myself

302
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:50,550
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

303
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,990
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

304
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:08,990
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

305
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:17,300
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

306
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,150
This unique moment...

307
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,160
Wow, fireworks are great, huh?
They truly are pretty!

308
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,580
I'd like to set some off sometime.
Huh? You'll let me?

309
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,510
I'm so happy! And what's more,
you'll let me set off that huge one?!

310
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,090
Wow! Then again, isn't that one too big?

311
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,930
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,320
"I Will Make it Bloom!
Usopp the Man and the Eight-Foot Shell"

313
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
