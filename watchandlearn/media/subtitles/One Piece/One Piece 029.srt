00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,560
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,940
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,550
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,140
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,890
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,010
We are!

24
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,670
You... damn caterpillar!!

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,360
Chore boy!!

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,750
Even if hundreds of
weapons are built in,

27
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,740
he can be defeated by someone
with a spear of blind determination.

28
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,170
At least...

29
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,360
...that kid doesn't have any hesitation.

30
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,630
Is it a survival instinct?

31
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,130
Or does he not fear death
because he has faith in himself?

32
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,530
Faith...

33
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,600
This is where you die!!

34
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,080
M-My Mighty Battle Spear is...
What the hell did you do?!

35
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,360
I gave it five punches.

36
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,670
I guess that's it for your spear.

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,980
That kid is pretty good.

38
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,840
He might do it...

39
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,490
This is bad...

40
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,800
I never imagined the Mighty
Battle Spear would be broken...

41
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,270
But he's taken that many explosions.
His body can't keep up...

42
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,390
"The Conclusion Of The Deadly Battle!
A Spear Of Blind Determination!"

43
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,910
Prepare yourself...

44
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,870
Huh?!

45
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,760
This is a big enough foothold.

46
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,510
With a foothold this size,
I can kick your ass.

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,980
What?

48
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,180
With the spear blade broken,
that's just a bomb on a stick.

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,140
The power is cut by half.

50
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,640
You think so?

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,570
Yeah, I do.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,770
A bomb on a stick? So what of it?

53
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,170
Given the shape you're in, it's more
than enough force to blow you away.

54
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,820
With your body falling apart like that,

55
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,740
whatever you say
sounds like just a bluff.

56
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,490
It's not a bluff.

57
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,260
Just give it up!
The moment you defied me,

58
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,670
you signed your death warrant!

59
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,540
I won't die! Bleah!

60
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,290
Hey! I'm over here!

61
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,220
That monkey!

62
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,590
Ooh ooh ahh!

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,910
He keeps hopping around!

64
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,280
It's useless!

65
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,450
Just how many built-in
weapons does he have?

66
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,420
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

67
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,390
What's that?!

68
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,460
Amazing...

69
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,990
What the hell is that?

70
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,980
I see a ton of arms...

71
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,830
All right, chore boy!!

72
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,940
Get him!!

73
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,010
Weak!

74
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,290
Your punches are powerless
against this wootz Steel Armor!

75
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,130
You can't even make a dent in it.

76
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,970
Gum-Gum Pistol!!

77
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,220
Don!!

78
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,530
How impudent!!

79
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,330
Useless! Useless! How useless!!

80
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,810
This armor won't break, even with
hundreds of monkey punches!

81
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,900
I think I'm pretty close...

82
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,870
He's gone...

83
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,060
I'm right here!

84
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,950
Now listen. The ultimate force
means the strongest equipment

85
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,690
and the strongest power!

86
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,670
The strong one is the one
who survives. The strong one is!

87
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,430
Then, that'll be me! Gum-Gum...

88
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,590
Useless! Useless! It's useless!!

89
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,270
Even pride will only get you so far!

90
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,670
...Bazooka!!

91
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,120
No good. This is all you can do.

92
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,660
What?! The strongest
armor is cracking?!

93
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,230
But it's too late.
You're done for, anchor boy!

94
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,250
It's a trap! Get out!!

95
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,610
Chore boy!!

96
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,500
Is it a survival instinct?

97
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,620
Or does he not fear death
because he has faith in himself?

98
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,920
Gum-Gum...

99
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,920
What?!

100
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,580
...Bazooka!!

101
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,390
All right!!

102
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,950
Good job!!

103
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,660
You're the best, chore boy!!

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,100
I win!!

105
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,930
Don't get carried away, brat!!

106
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,380
Ugh! He's still alive!

107
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,780
Oh, no!

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,090
Can you escape?! It's a steel net!

109
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,000
Below us is the ocean.
The game is over, anchor boy!

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,550
I'm the one who's
getting the last laugh!

111
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,810
All right! That's our Don!

112
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,810
Make him fall!

113
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,090
Get him!!

114
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,760
If I can get my arms and legs out,
the game is mine!

115
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,310
Why doesn't he flinch?

116
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,180
Why does he go that far?

117
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,020
What?!

118
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,060
This is gonna end it... for sure!

119
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,410
Gum-Gum...

120
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,980
...Giant Gavel!!

121
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,080
...Giant Gavel!!

122
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,910
Don Krieg...

123
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,490
Don... Don was defeated! Why?!

124
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,100
Dammit! Why? Why was Don...

125
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,980
All right, chore boy!!

126
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,100
Good job!!

127
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,440
He really did it!!

128
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,890
A-Amazing!!

129
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,600
Is this real? This is Don Krieg
we're talking about!

130
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,060
So strong! He's too strong!

131
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,320
Wh... What's all this fuss?

132
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,660
Oh! You've come to!!

133
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,300
He lost! Your Don lost!

134
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,800
What?!

135
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,310
If you have time to daydream,
go save that kid already!

136
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,520
Huh?

137
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,520
He won't be floating up to the surface!

138
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,280
What?!

139
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,920
Those with the Devil Fruit power
are hated by the sea

140
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,740
and lose the ability to swim.

141
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,910
What'd you say, you damn geezer?!

142
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,580
You should've told me that sooner!

143
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,820
What're you gonna do if it's too late?!

144
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,320
Where did he go?

145
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,560
Hey! Hang in there!!

146
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,540
You said you wouldn't die, right?

147
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,220
That's your faith, right?!

148
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,160
Right?!

149
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,390
I won't die!

150
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,330
I'm not gonna die here.

151
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,420
Really, these guys...

152
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,090
Zoro!!

153
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,630
He should give up his ambition
rather than dying!

154
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,820
It should be easy...
to give up your ambition, right?!

155
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,520
They're all...

156
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,780
I don't know...
I don't know why, but...

157
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,320
...if I withdrew even a step,

158
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,960
I feel like those various
important things such as pledges

159
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,250
and promises in the
past will be shattered,

160
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,100
and I won't be able to come
back to where I am now...

161
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,130
He can be defeated by someone
with a spear of blind determination.

162
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:32,670
I know an idiot who's holding back
that spear for a stupid reason...

163
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,990
All... Blue...

164
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,070
Hey, chore boy! Don't you die on me!

165
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,620
Don! What's the matter?!

166
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Why was Don...

167
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,870
Don Krieg has been defeated...

168
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,610
This can't be true...
He's the ruler of the East Blue...

169
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,120
That man is...
That man is... That man is...

170
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,400
That man is...

171
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,980
Even if you say so...
Just take a look at that!

172
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,880
His proud armor got shattered
and he's knocked out.

173
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,380
He got defeated good.
You're not gonna see it?

174
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:56,110
He's the only man I admired...
I believed he was the strongest!

175
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,000
Hey wait, underling!

176
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,170
If you move around now,
the poison'll pass into your system.

177
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,010
Don't move around!

178
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,750
I'm saying this for your own good!

179
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,920
Hey! You're gonna die!

180
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,050
Chore boy! Don't die! Can you hear me?!

181
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,450
You still have things to do, right?!

182
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,890
Hey! Don't die! Chore boy!

183
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,320
Say... Say something!!
Chore boy! Don't die!!

184
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,020
You're such a...

185
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
You're really something else...

186
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,310
I'm the strongest!!

187
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:53,880
I win! No one defeats my force!!

188
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,150
Don! Please stop!

189
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,470
Hold him! He's not even conscious!

190
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,630
I'll win!!

191
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,740
Please stop, Don!!

192
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,690
I'll win! Using my force!!

193
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,540
I... have to win!!

194
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,230
I'm the strongest man!!

195
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,610
Don Krieg... We lost.

196
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,160
Chief Commander!

197
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,060
Let's withdraw gracefully
and start afresh.

198
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,030
Thanks for everything, Sanji-san.

199
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,800
Sure. Don't ever come back!

200
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:02,530
Sanji-san, when he wakes up,
please tell him I said...

201
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,870
...I'll see you again in the Grand Line.

202
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,120
You...

203
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,160
When I think about it carefully,
that's the only thing I want to do...

204
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:24,060
It seems that Don Krieg's ambition
became mine as well before I knew it.

205
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,310
Maybe... I can live only
a few more hours...

206
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,120
It's kind of stupid that I'm resolved
because I don't have much time left,

207
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,700
but this time, I want to do it with
my own will... in my own way...

208
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,550
Then, there'll be nowhere
for me to escape, right?

209
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,520
The hell with loyalty towards Don!

210
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,970
I've just been running away using
Don Krieg's name as a shield...

211
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,710
Once you're resolved,

212
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,030
you don't have to think
about stupid things

213
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,340
like fearing your enemy
or how to keep from getting hurt...

214
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I learned it from that guy.

215
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,350
Patty! Carne!! Give him the boat
used to go grocery shopping!

216
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,670
What?! Are you stupid?!

217
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,930
Why do we have to
give our boat to pirates?!

218
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,580
What's gonna happen to our
grocery shopping?! You idiot!

219
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,440
He's right! Let those guys swim!

220
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,290
Just bring it out already!!

221
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,910
Okay, we got it...

222
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,370
Don't yell at us...

223
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,950
Okay, okay, we'll bring it out!

224
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,650
It's gonna sink!

225
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,720
Why did I hesitate?
What was I so worried about?

226
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,750
When I think about it, I feel stupid...

227
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,340
Well, then! We gratefully
accept the boat.

228
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,170
We don't have to return it, right?

229
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,340
Right. If you have the courage
to come here to return it,

230
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,190
try it, you small fry.

231
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,160
He's right! Just keep this in your brain!!

232
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,990
This is the sea restaurant
Baratie, where cooks fight!

233
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,900
Yeah!!

234
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,340
Hmph! What a scary restaurant...

235
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,170
They were nice guys...

236
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,510
I wonder if they'll let me join them
again when I see them next time...

237
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,090
I wonder if I'll be able
to see them again...

238
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,060
I wanna be free...

239
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,020
Bellemere-san...

240
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

241
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

242
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

243
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

244
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

245
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

246
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,870
so that my memories won't fade

247
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,310
Now I'm free from the chores
since pops promised me.

248
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,270
hat's right.

249
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,150
By the way, will you...

250
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,310
I'm not going. I won't become a pirate.

251
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,440
Okay...

252
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,570
Hey, you haven't given up yet!

253
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,990
But I'm hoping to go to
the Grand Line some day.

254
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,160
Then let's go now.

255
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,990
It's not the right time yet!

256
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

257
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,990
"Set Sail! The Seafaring
Cook Sets Off With Luffy"

258
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,530
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
