2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,630
Geez... Why are all of you
being so stubborn

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,160
even towards your friends?!

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,580
This is...

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,910
a perfect chance to run, right?!

6
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,130
Wait!

7
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,060
I won't run away!

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,020
Wait, Robin-chan.

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,480
Why are you acting like that
at this point?

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,200
We came to rescue you
knowing all the circumstances!

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,910
If we just do something about the
Government's attack, Buster Call,

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,430
there shouldn't be a reason that
you have to obey them, right?!

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,290
That Buster Call is...

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,800
...indeed the problem.

15
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,430
Tempest Kick!

16
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,560
Sanji!

17
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,210
What happened?

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,310
He appeared from nowhere!

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,490
This is bad...

20
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,950
I have to do something.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,630
Dang it!

22
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,630
Hold it!

23
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,340
What're you doing?!

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,130
Just stay back!

25
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,220
Hey, you! I'll take you...

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,050
Huh?! He's gone!

27
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,240
Wh-When did he...?!

28
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,730
Wh-Where'd he go?!

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,480
Where is he?!

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,290
It's all right! Now
let's move forward

31
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,650
with the sun always in our hearts

32
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,080
As power passes through
our clasped hands

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,280
let's grab hold of our wishes

34
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,050
Working together,

35
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,840
let's ride the giant waves

36
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,140
Let's hurry toward the excitement--

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,530
there's the starting signal

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,610
Now's the time to set sail--

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,510
let's raise anchor

40
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,330
Cut through
the rainbow-colored wind

41
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,000
and head for a sea of adventure

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
It'll be a journey
fraught with injury

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,380
but what you cherish most
will be right there

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,380
And if you get into a jam

45
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,140
I'll always be there to protect you

46
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,600
It's all right!
Now let's move forward

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,100
with the sun always in our hearts

48
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,230
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

49
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,280
and gaze at the light beyond

50
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,320
If we gather up
the pieces of our dreams

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,620
they'll make a map
leading to tomorrow

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,080
So let's grab hold of our wishes

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,380
under the same flag--
together, we're one

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,570
One Piece

55
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,590
"The Judicial Island!
Full View of Enies Lobby!"

56
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,050
Blueno disappeared?!

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,700
It's not that he's disappeared.

58
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,080
He only made a door
out of the wall of air

59
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,810
by using "Air Door,"

60
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,540
the true value
of the Door Door Fruit, that's all.

61
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,600
You can't escape from us...

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
It's simply not possible.

63
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,770
Let Robin...

64
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:56,930
go...

65
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Finger Pistol.

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,080
Usopp!

67
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,330
Iron Body.

68
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,580
Did my attack earlier work?

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,460
That's a weak kick.

70
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,890
How stubborn.

71
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,060
Stop it!

72
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,400
I won't run away.

73
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,280
That should be enough.

74
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,240
They're the ones who keep
attacking me.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,140
I can't help it.

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,600
Then let's hurry up and leave.

77
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,330
Wait!

78
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,340
It's okay...

79
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,860
Robin.

80
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,470
You'll be fine.

81
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,160
You're still hiding something,
aren't you?

82
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,700
That's okay.

83
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,360
But a pirate...

84
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,350
cannot leave their group...

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,100
...without their captain's...

86
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,980
permission.

87
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,900
So...

88
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,580
...believe...

89
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,880
...in Luffy.

90
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,810
Wait, Robin-chan!

91
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,250
It's no use.

92
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,640
Nico Robin will
not break the agreement.

93
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,230
How can you say that?

94
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,440
Many years ago,
an island ceased to exist.

95
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,200
This island was burned to the ground
without a trace by a Buster Call

96
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,820
that was issued by the Navy.

97
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,750
The only survivor of that

98
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,250
was the child Nico Robin.

99
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,710
What?!

100
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,410
Five vice admirals and
ten battleships...

101
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,120
To that woman who witnessed
their overwhelming military power,

102
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,390
Buster Call is an
inexpungible nightmare.

103
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,180
If the terror planted in
her heart during her childhood

104
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,190
is directed towards her friends,

105
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,060
she can no longer
have the spirit to resist us.

106
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,770
Don't tell me...

107
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,530
...you're doing this
knowing all that...

108
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,570
Of course.

109
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,560
You bastards...

110
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,370
Just how depraved are you bastards?!

111
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,380
Everything is for the sake of justice.

112
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,840
I do deeply sympathize
with that woman.

113
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,990
Don't give me that crap!

114
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,990
You damn bastards!

115
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,790
Hm? Y... You...!

116
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,460
Hurry up and sit down, Nico Robin.

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,490
We'll soon arrive in Enies Lobby.

118
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,680
H... Hey!

119
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,890
Wait a sec!

120
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,260
I said wait!

121
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,750
Hey!

122
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,370
Is it okay to let those two
be in the same car?

123
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,060
It won't be too long
before we get there.

124
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,570
What could happen?

125
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,610
We're not gonna let
them escape anymore.

126
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,650
They are both criminals
who'll be executed shortly.

127
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,030
Let them grieve over their
fate as much as they can.

128
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
F... F...

129
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,100
Ribbit!

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,970
F...

131
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,570
Frog!

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,080
Ribbit!

133
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,490
Don't "ribbit" me, you jerk!

134
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,410
The train got derailed
because of your slap!

135
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,040
Ahhh! Step aside! Step aside!

136
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,410
We're gonna collide!

137
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,330
Ribbit!

138
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,580
We were finally about to catch
up with Sanji and the others!

139
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,210
What're you gonna do about it?!

140
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,210
Ribbit!

141
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,430
You little...!
I'm gonna eat you, jerk!

142
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,640
Ribbit!

143
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,170
Ow, ow, ow...

144
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,080
What on earth
is going on with this sea train?

145
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,020
Hey, are you guys okay?

146
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,320
Somehow...

147
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,440
M... My lower back...

148
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,580
What the hell?!

149
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,250
Our King Bulls disappeared!

150
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,390
What?!

151
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,330
They disappeared?!

152
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,830
Well, it's probably us
who disappeared.

153
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,380
We probably got derailed.

154
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,630
Whoa! That's worse!

155
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,120
What're we gonna do?!

156
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,550
"What're we gonna do?!"
We can't do anything about it.

157
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,140
Zoro!

158
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,220
Wha...

159
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,350
You're kidding me...!

160
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,080
M-Miracle...

161
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,930
Here we go.

162
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,120
Geez, that darn Yokozuna!

163
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,380
He's sure got bad timing.

164
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,830
Are you guys okay?

165
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Yeah, somehow.

166
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,710
Darn Yokozuna!

167
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,550
Well, looks like you guys're okay.

168
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,800
Hey!

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,470
Hm?

170
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,190
Are we okay?!

171
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,140
We'd better still
be able to get to Enies Lobby!

172
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,700
Shut up!

173
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,810
Just wait a sec!

174
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,150
That being said...

175
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,820
we got into a
weird current.

176
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,540
What's going on?

177
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,570
Kokoro-san.

178
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,150
Hm?

179
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,490
Do you know which
direction the island is?

180
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,440
Yeah,

181
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,580
the sea train comes already
equipped with Eternal Poses

182
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,660
for the islands with stations.

183
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,410
Then it'll be fine!

184
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,560
I'll check the sea,
so please control the train!

185
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,540
Hm?

186
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,940
What're you gonna...

187
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,550
Me?

188
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,010
I'm a navigator!

189
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,530
Oh, I see!

190
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,990
That's reassuring!

191
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,010
Oh, before that...

192
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,510
Hey, Yokozuna!

193
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,480
Get over here!

194
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,820
Ribbit!

195
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,530
He jumped!

196
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,700
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

197
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,690
You're glad that we're okay?!

198
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,750
Geez...

199
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,280
I didn't get kidnapped!

200
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,790
You jumped the gun.

201
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,540
Ribbit?

202
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,800
Grandma's talking with Yokozuna?

203
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,520
What're you guys doing?

204
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,810
That frog from earlier
and granny are talking.

205
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,730
What?! Then granny is a frog?!

206
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,540
It's true that she's
more frog than human.

207
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,240
You guys're gonna get
beaten up later.

208
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,150
Yeah, you are.

209
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,890
Hello!

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,570
Straw Hat! Rocketman!

211
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,680
Do you see them?!

212
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,240
No, I don't!

213
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,300
That damn huge frog!

214
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,000
Where did he send Straw Hat
and the others flying?!

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,120
Guys!

216
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,580
This is no time for grumbling!

217
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,670
We set out to sea in order
to rescue Big Bro Franky!

218
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,780
That's right!

219
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,220
We just have to
believe that Rocketman will be back

220
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,510
and keep moving forward
to Enies Lobby!

221
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,430
Hurry!

222
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,260
Sodom! Gomorrah!

223
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,580
Hm?!

224
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,690
Hey! Guys! Look ahead!

225
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,690
I've found more detached cars!

226
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,100
Whether they're friend
or foe is unknown!

227
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,900
Everyone, prepare for battle!

228
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,030
Yeah!

229
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,730
Ahoy!

230
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,790
Is anyone in there?!

231
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,450
We're the Franky Family!

232
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,180
Show your face!

233
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,250
Hey, someone came out!

234
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,710
That's... spring eyebrows!

235
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,510
This is Enies Lobby
Department of Management.

236
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,680
Is everything in order?

237
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,390
Yes, we're bringing the two
criminals without any delay.

238
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,320
Since we can now see the
island ahead, we'll arrive shortly.

239
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,680
Understood.

240
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,270
Well then,
we'll be awaiting your return.

241
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,030
After five years of absence,
naturally, it makes me feel nostalgic.

242
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,750
The nightless island, Enies Lobby...

243
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,210
H-He's alive?!

244
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,090
I-Is it really... true?!

245
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,160
Yeah, so I was told.

246
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,880
I see...

247
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,180
I see...

248
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm glad...

249
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,600
That darn Stupid-berg!

250
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,570
I was totally
convinced that he was killed!

251
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,800
I see...

252
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,140
I'm glad.

253
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,880
CP9 might be thinking
that they killed him.

254
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,690
It's better if you
keep it to yourself.

255
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,820
Isn't what you're doing
called "kindness"?

256
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,050
At any rate,

257
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,800
the Government has now successfully
obtained the two keys...

258
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,800
Me, who owns the weapon's blueprints,

259
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,020
and you, who can revive
the existing weapon.

260
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,480
When that power actually
appears in this world,

261
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,400
the Government will
naturally end this pirate era.

262
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,960
After that,
this military power will become

263
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,960
too much to handle, and will shake
the world to its core and destroy it.

264
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,910
The ancient weapon
is that much of a threat.

265
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,710
Our master didn't lay down his
life protecting the blueprints

266
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,680
for such a stupid future!

267
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,540
So,

268
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,080
even if I could escape,
it's pointless if it's just me alone.

269
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,870
You, too, somehow go back
to Straw Hat!

270
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,190
That's not possible.

271
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,600
I hurt them just by being with them.

272
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,530
Ever since she can remember,

273
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,860
her existence itself was a sin.

274
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,620
It's not you who hurts them, is it?

275
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,900
The people from the Government
say your existence is a sin,

276
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,570
but no matter what
weapons you're carrying,

277
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,000
your being there isn't a sin.

278
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,440
No matter what kind of ship it is,

279
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,280
the act of building it...

280
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,310
...is neither an act of good nor evil!

281
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,870
So...

282
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,740
Her existence itself was a sin.

283
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,120
No...!

284
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,150
Your existence isn't a sin!

285
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,620
Seriously, what
happened to your body?

286
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,250
It's full of scars!

287
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,580
Since...

288
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,940
...that day eight years ago...

289
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,090
Since that incident where
Tom-san was taken away...

290
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,390
...you've been challenging
the sea train every single day.

291
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,160
You... wanted to
become strong, right?

292
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,280
So that you won't lose
those you love again...

293
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,380
So that you can protect
those you love...

294
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,570
Ribbit...

295
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,880
Yokozuna...

296
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,420
Then now's the time for
you to show the result of that training!

297
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,720
Ribbit?

298
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,370
Franky, the one you love so much,

299
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,820
has been taken away
just like Tom-san was.

300
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,620
This train is currently headed
towards where he is, too.

301
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,230
Do you wanna come along?

302
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,230
Ribbit...

303
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,380
Ribbit!

304
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,460
Straw Hat!

305
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,180
We've got one more comrade!

306
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,780
Okay, got it!

307
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,830
Just as we'd expect
from Monster Granny!

308
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,000
Or, are you actually Frog Granny?

309
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,210
Which one is it?

310
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,380
Who cares?

311
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,470
Kokoro-san!

312
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,970
I found a good current!
It's in the eight o'clock direction!

313
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,400
All right!

314
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,550
We've wasted quite a bit of time.

315
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,640
We'll recover it in an instant!

316
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,350
Let's go! Frog!

317
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,480
Ribbit!

318
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,690
CP9 has arrived.

319
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,510
Hurry up!

320
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,680
Good work on your
long-term mission, sir!

321
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,470
Bring the criminals out!
They're in car #1!

322
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,100
You bastard!

323
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,920
Stop it!

324
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,860
Treat me with care!

325
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,080
Who do you think I am?!

326
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,210
Whoa! Don't come this way!

327
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,710
Ahh! Be careful! He'll bite you!

328
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,340
What a noisy man...

329
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,260
Coo coo.

330
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,020
Just as you'd expect from CP9.

331
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,820
How intimidating.

332
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,900
He's Cutty Flam, right?

333
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,280
Then that woman is...

334
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,160
...Nico Robin?!

335
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,070
What a beauty!

336
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,560
Open the main gate!

337
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,740
Whoa...!

338
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,850
What the hell is this place?!

339
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,730
Is this... a waterfall?!

340
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,550
What the hell's with this island?!

341
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,400
We had a dream that day

342
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,220
Our belief in ourselves

343
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,250
makes us able to cross

344
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,910
the wildly surging ocean

345
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:44,090
You're braver and more caring

346
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,380
than anyone else

347
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,110
If you ever depart this ship

348
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,770
and live in a different world

349
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,700
In the end,

350
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,280
we can all surely smile

351
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,370
We can finally see Enies Lobby!

352
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,650
So that's the entrance of
the World Government, huh?!

353
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,720
Guys!

354
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
Get ready for the final battle!

355
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,890
Sanji-kun and Uso--

356
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,760
I mean, that Sogeking guy
have joined us, so now...

357
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,000
We'll bring down the whole
place and rescue Robin!

358
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,630
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,300
"Landing Operations Start!
Charge in, Straw Hats!"

360
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,580
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
