00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,940
I just heard the rumors about you...

20
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,320
You got business with me?

21
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,280
Yeah! Give back old diamond-head's gold!

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,930
Gold?

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,570
You mean old man Cricket's stuff?

24
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,150
Why should I give anything back?
I stole that stuff as a pirate.

25
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,950
As a pirate yourself, you're in
no position to find fault with me!

26
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,810
Am too.

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,070
They're my friends. So I'm stealing it back.

28
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,600
"100 Million Man! World's Greatest
Power and Pirate Blackbeard!"

29
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,460
I hate to ask, but can you fight?!
Do you know how to throw a punch?!

30
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,320
What can a coward like you possibly do?!

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,640
N-No doubt about it! That's him!

32
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,200
Geez, you still got that?! Tear it
up and throw it away already!

33
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,840
But if this wanted poster is real...

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,610
Not even Bellamy stands a chance
against a 100 million-Berry bounty!

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,520
Ridiculous! Just look at that runt!
Does he look nefarious to you?!

36
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,620
That makes me suspicious of his
30 million bounty poster, too!

37
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,590
If you just stand there in
fear like this afternoon,

38
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,010
you ain't gonna steal
nothing from me, coward!

39
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,930
This afternoon was different.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,230
That so? And just how is it different?!

41
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,540
This time, I'll shut your
smart-alecky mouth for good!

42
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,480
It's collapsing!

43
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,180
I'll finish you in an instant!

44
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,980
Spring...

45
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,630
...Snipe!

46
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,290
Oh! Straw Hat flew, too!

47
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,580
Amateur trash...

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,020
What'd that runt come all the way here for?!

49
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,430
Let's all sit back and enjoy Bellamy's "show"!

50
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,120
He talked all big, but now
he's just running away!

51
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,180
Nothing's different at all...

52
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,430
It's just like this afternoon!

53
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,550
You're gonna steal the gold back?!

54
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,290
You're just a weakling who's all talk,
who can't stand up to me,

55
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,630
and can't do anything but
blather on about dreams!

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,970
--He's coming this way!
--Run!

57
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Struggle all you want--

58
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,980
there's no escape from my
Spring-Spring Fruit power!

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,470
Finished already? Pathetic!

60
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,160
No way that kid can stand
a chance against Bellamy!

61
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,780
That didn't kill you, did it?

62
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
He got up!

63
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,970
It's too early to kick the bucket!

64
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,480
My show's just getting to the good part!

65
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,590
Spring...

66
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,090
...Hopper!

67
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,060
Bellamy disappeared!

68
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,730
He did this when Roshio
the Executioner was killed!

69
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,430
They're your friends, huh?!

70
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,690
Come to think of it, that geezer and
those giant apes are just like you!

71
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,770
You're a clan of natural-born
morons who believe in a fish story

72
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,740
told by some guy 400 years ago!

73
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,790
A city of gold? A sky island?!

74
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,170
The era of dreams is over,
you pathetic excuses for pirates!

75
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,670
Do I know how to throw a punch, you ask?

76
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,980
Get 'im, Bellamy! That moron
isn't fit to live in reality!

77
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
So long, Straw Hat!

78
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,470
Hey... Quit kiddin' around, Bellamy...

79
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,670
C'mon! You're just joking, right?!

80
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Say something!

81
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,270
Hey! Bellamy! Quit acting dumb!

82
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,730
C'mon, get up! Continue
your usual show! Bellamy!

83
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,860
You're a major rookie with a 55 million reward!

84
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,310
That's right! Those two from this afternoon!

85
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,410
Their bounties are higher than yours, Bellamy!

86
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,320
S-See! I told you...!

87
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,260
The old guy's gold. Give it back.

88
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,280
Man, they're tough!

89
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,220
They got all beat up,
but now they're just fine...

90
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,950
I know Chopper tended to 'em,
but they almost seem immortal...

91
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,120
Why didn't you go?

92
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,540
Huh? What's with you?!

93
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,510
It's, "Don't fight! Do this! Don't go! Go!"

94
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,210
No! I mean, they beat you, too!

95
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,800
Beat?

96
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,060
They weren't really standing
in our way, you know.

97
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,770
Fights that leave nothing
but sympathy are rough.

98
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,940
What? Are you an idiot?

99
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,720
Shut up and get lost! You're in the way!

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm what?! You're the one who never listens!

101
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,590
--Why do I have to listen to you?!
--Hey, now! Be careful there!

102
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:28,080
Are you guys insane?! This ship
is our treasure! Hey! I said stop!

103
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,720
I got it!

104
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,740
T-That runt... It was a fluke!

105
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,720
Hey, you!

106
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,500
Stop! I'm still here!

107
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,770
C'mon! Bring it on!

108
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,100
There's no way we can lose
to dream-chasing morons!

109
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,480
What's wrong?! Hey, Straw Hat!
Where're you going?!

110
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,820
Where?

111
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,390
The sky!

112
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,380
So these are the ones
who defeated Sir Crocodile,

113
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,510
one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea...

114
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,020
Monkey D. Luffy... and Roronoa Zoro...

115
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,750
Three-Sword Style Technique!

116
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,190
Three Thousand Worlds!

117
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,240
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame.

118
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,700
Admirable!

119
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,460
Try to surpass me! Roronoa Zoro!

120
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,960
So those kids've grown to the point

121
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,180
that they can shake up
the World Government...

122
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,240
"Holy Land of Marie Jois"

123
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,840
What? Red-Hair?!

124
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,320
Yes. He is acting disturbingly...

125
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,500
"Justice"

126
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,800
But I assume he didn't take action himself?

127
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,670
No. He did so indirectly, using a messenger...

128
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,050
But it's too dangerous for Whitebeard
and Red-Hair to make contact!

129
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:54,310
"World Government Supreme Authorities
'The Five Elder Stars'"

130
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,700
Yes, that is true.

131
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,570
But Red-Hair is formidable only when agitated;

132
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,720
he is not the type to change things
about the world on his own.

133
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,250
Let us be patient and watch.

134
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,520
The Seven Warlords of the Sea
are more important now.

135
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,900
We must find a successor for Crocodile quickly.

136
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,120
Do not underestimate his loss.

137
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,780
The collapse of the Three Great Powers
will fracture the world itself.

138
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,740
Balance must be maintained.

139
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,580
Yes, sir! That is why we have
called the Seven Warlords here,

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,160
but who knows how many will show up?

141
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,050
They are pirates. They do as they please...

142
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,670
Damn you, Crocodile. You've put
us in a dreadful situation...

143
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,490
We can no longer let this man
who beat you remain unchecked...

144
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,670
Monkey D. Luffy...

145
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,680
Navy HQ to MaryJoa.

146
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,420
Don Quixote Doflamingo-sama
and Bartholomew Kuma-sama

147
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,490
of the Seven Warlords of the Sea have arrived.

148
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,450
"Warlord of the Sea Don Quixote Doflamingo
Former Bounty: 340 Million Berries"

149
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,240
"Warlord of the Sea Bartholomew Kuma
Former Bounty: 296 Million Berries"

150
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,380
Hey! Stop! What are you doing?!

151
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,840
No! My hands are moving on their own!

152
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,350
Don't be stupid! This is no time for jokes!

153
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,680
I'm not joking! I can't control my body!

154
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,140
The hell you can't...! I can't breathe!

155
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,310
Knock it off! What do you think you're doing?!

156
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,210
--Are you trying to kill me?!
--It's not me!

157
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,510
Stop it! Where you do think you are?!

158
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,810
"Navy HQ Vice-Admiral

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,400
Doflamingo! This is your doing! Stop it at once!

160
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:31,060
Then start talking already,
or I'll end this lousy get-together!

161
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,960
Hey! You idiot! Stop!

162
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,960
"Justice"

163
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,840
Stop! Make him stop, Doflamingo! Damn you!

164
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,420
Enough!

165
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,080
Don't be fools! Did you
come here to start a war?!

166
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,930
"Navy HQ Fleet Admiral
(Naval Commander in Chief)
'Saint Sengoku'"

167
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,690
Oh, pardon my late welcome.
Thank you for coming, scum of the sea.

168
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,460
Oh, my. Listen to the big-shot talk...

169
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,530
Let us begin. I doubt any more will come.

170
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,040
Two out of six is better than I expected.

171
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,550
I bet.

172
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,500
I didn't plan to come either, but my
island's business is going so well...

173
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,230
...that I came out of sheer boredom.

174
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,720
I see. That's disconcerting to hear.

175
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,100
Nothing is as depressing to us
as a booming pirate industry.

176
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,780
You're quite in-your-face!

177
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,520
You betray the "Saint" in your name,
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

178
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,010
I hear dreary bickering...

179
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,830
Did I perhaps come to the wrong place?

180
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,010
Hawk-Eye!

181
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,410
The Navy HQ and the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

182
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,120
That roundtable seems meaningless
for those two opposing powers.

183
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,750
Oh, my! A most unexpected man has arrived!

184
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,050
Don't tell me you're...

185
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,010
No, I'm simply an onlooker here.

186
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,470
I'm a bit interested in some pirates
involved with the issue at hand.

187
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,560
That's all.

188
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,280
In that case, I, too, am an onlooker...
Is that acceptable?

189
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,330
Well, I suppose I'm not exactly an "onlooker"...

190
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,450
Who are you?! How did you get in here?!

191
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,160
But what a truly eminent-looking
group you have here...

192
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,910
I've come in the hopes...

193
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,590
--Huh?!
--...that I be allowed to join in your meeting...

194
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,590
...if at all possible.

195
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,970
I do believe you have
stripped Crocodile of his title

196
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,520
and are now looking for a successor?

197
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,230
You...! Are you Lafitte?!

198
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,950
Lafitte?

199
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,900
Oh, you know my name?

200
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,190
I'm quite honored!

201
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,910
He was a well-known
peace officer in West Blue!

202
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,580
He was chased from his country
for being excessively violent!

203
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,120
That was long ago.

204
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,240
Who I am is of no importance!

205
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,260
I've come to recommend a certain man
for the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

206
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,550
Shanks... That name brings back memories...

207
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,160
So this is a letter from him?

208
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,800
Yes. It appears to be important,
so he gave it to me to deliver!

209
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,920
I see! Well done, then!

210
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,760
No, I'm still new to the Red-Haired Pirates...

211
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,530
"Red-Haired Pirates (Newcomer)
Rockstar
Bounty: 94 Million Berries"

212
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,340
Though I was a pirate before that,

213
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,740
and I think I made a bit of a name for myself...

214
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,660
Hey! You guys've heard of Rockstar, right?!

215
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,920
Nope. Never heard of 'im.

216
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,210
Anyways, the Sea King tasted great...

217
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,800
Hey! What are you--?!

218
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,240
Sending me a damn letter...

219
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,540
When did that kid stoop
to being such a big-shot?!

220
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,810
Hey! Hold on, now!

221
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,020
He acted like this was an important letter!

222
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,650
This is Red-Hair you're dealing with!
Are you sane in the head?!

223
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm Whitebeard!

224
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,160
Captain. That's probably
enough alcohol for now...

225
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,790
Fool! Something you drink when
you wanna drink can't be bad for ya!

226
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,130
My boss said this was an urgent letter!

227
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,240
I have a good idea what it's about.
Ace and Blackbeard.

228
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,730
Go tell that kid Red-Hair
that if he wants to talk to me,

229
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,750
to come here himself,
and with some good booze, too!

230
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:13,140
Now go! I don't feel like talkin'
with snot-nosed runts, you buffoon.

231
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,780
"Strongest Man in the World 'Whitebeard'
The Great Pirate Edward Newgate"

232
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,580
The old man hasn't changed!

233
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,790
This is no laughing matter, Boss!

234
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,250
Nah, I had an inkling this'd happen.

235
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,260
Give me a little more time! I've never
been insulted like this before!

236
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,720
Hey, now! What're you
planning to do? Forget about it.

237
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,060
Thanks for your help.
You can come straight back now.

238
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,650
B-But, I have my pride...!

239
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,700
Your life is more important than your pride.

240
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,710
There's nothing you can do now.
Sorry for all the trouble.

241
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,410
So, what're you gonna do, Boss?

242
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
I'm going. Prepare to set sail!

243
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,870
To see Whitebeard?!

244
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,770
Yep, that's right!

245
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,040
Do you think the government
will keep quiet if you do that?

246
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,300
This is no time for that.

247
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,010
It's no big deal.

248
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,330
The government probably won't stay quiet...

249
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,920
...but if they're gonna get in our way,
we won't stay quiet, either!

250
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,350
Men! It's battle time!

251
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,110
Alright! Get some top-quality alcohol ready!

252
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
Teach?

253
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,030
Yes. The captain of our pirate crew.

254
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,990
Never heard of him.
Some random, unknown guy

255
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,790
would be no threat to other pirates.

256
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,210
Yes, we realize that.

257
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,920
To that end, we are carefully devising a plan,

258
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,580
so I ask for a little more time.

259
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,540
Interesting! C'mon! Let 'em try, Sengoku!

260
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:10,250
We are the Blackbeard Pirates.
Please remember that name...

261
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,770
Hey, did you hear?! Bellamy was beaten!

262
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,010
Whoa! By who?!

263
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,080
100 million...

264
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,040
In terms of ambitious spirit, I didn't
think he was even worth 30 million...

265
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,660
To think it was this high...

266
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,000
What's the plan, Captain?

267
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,960
Hey, you! Don't just stand there gawking!

268
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,860
I'm really ticked off right now!

269
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,170
Shut... up!

270
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,880
I got no business with small-fries!

271
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,360
I was looking for a head
worth over 100 million!

272
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,270
We're about to join the big leagues now!

273
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,170
The time to hunt some prey has finally come!

274
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,980
Captain! Weren't we supposed to
meet up with Lafitte in this town?!

Seems we got separated!
But that's how luck is sometimes!

277
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,540
Right, Auger?!

Hold on! I'll be there soon!

284
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,770
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

285
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:27,950
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

286
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:43,710
There are days where I almost lose to myself

287
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:51,710
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

288
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,250
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

289
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:08,260
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

290
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:17,530
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

291
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,890
This unique moment...

292
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,840
Gimme a break! I'm scared here!

293
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,680
We're being sucked into the whirlpool!

294
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,140
Nobody said anything about a
giant whirlpool! This is a scam!

295
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,760
Let's turn back! The sky island
is just a dream within a dream!

296
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,100
An island in a dream within a dream!

297
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,980
I'll regret it for life if I pass
up such a big adventure!

298
