00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesometreasure
at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be Kingof
the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyonedreamed
of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seenthrough
a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destinyis
leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieveyour
dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse ofthe
tail end to the future

17
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,260
The Going Merry fell right into
themiddle of a Naval base, Navarone.

18
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,290
Luffy and the others dispersedunder
the cover of darkness.

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,760
"On Duty"

20
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,550
Nami successfully disguisedherself
as a cleaning person.

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,980
Luffy and Sanji slipped
intothe dining hall as cooks.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,140
However, one of the crew,Zoro,
has been captured.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,260
Welcome to Navarone.

24
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,580
"Captured Zoro andChopper's
Emergency Operations!"

25
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,970
So six more, huh?

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,160
One of the Straw Hat Pirates, Roronoa Zoro...

27
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,880
Drake, shall we try questioning him?

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,890
But you told us to checkthe
dining hall, Commander.

29
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,620
Hm? I did?

30
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,940
You said that everyone gets hungry,so
they're likely to appear in the dining hall.

31
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,860
I'll go to the dining hall.

32
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,310
Jessica told me that new cooks
fromheadquarters are coming as well, so...

33
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,520
How should we proceedwith questioning Zoro?

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,340
"Justice"

35
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,880
I'll leave it to you.

36
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,250
Man... What the hell's with these guys?

37
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,140
Well, I guess I'll take it easy for a while.

38
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,430
Open the cell.

39
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,360
Yes, sir, Lt. Commander Drake!But
he's extremely dangerous.

40
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,830
By order of Vice Admiral Jonathan,I'll
question Roronoa Zoro.

41
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,030
Yes, sir! Please be careful.

42
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,250
Roronoa Zoro... You usedto
be called a pirate hunter.

43
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,390
I would never have imagined that you'dbe
a member of the Straw Hat Pirates.

44
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,900
What, you came all theway
here to tell me that?

45
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,950
Where did you come from?!How
many of you are there?!

46
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,720
What is your purposein
invading this fortress?!

47
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,410
It was a good strategy to invade
this"hedgehog" fortress from the sky.

48
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,750
How did you do it?Did
you build a launch pad?!

49
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,310
Oh, we came from heaven.

50
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,970
Don't mock me!

51
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,700
I'm not mocking you or anything.We
really came from the sky.

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,980
I don't intend to go along with such a joke!

53
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:14,040
Like I said, we came from heavenby
riding a floating octopus balloon.

54
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,530
Got it?

55
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,710
So you insist on that, no matter what?

56
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,810
Don't make light of the Navy!

57
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,740
I'm gonna make you tellus
the truth at any cost!

58
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,080
"On Duty"

59
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,020
Next, you'll be in charge
ofcleaning this exercise hall.

60
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,250
Okay, Boss!

61
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,240
"On Duty"

62
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,500
What is this...?

63
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,730
I have to clean this... by myself?!

64
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,860
Give the floor a good polish!You'll
enjoy lunch after your hard work!

65
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,210
This disguise may have been a mistake!

66
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,440
I heard that one of theStraw
Hat Pirates was captured!

67
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,210
What?! That wasn't a ghost ship, then?!

68
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,030
Yeah, in a sense, it's scarier than
ghosts.Don't be surprised when I tell you this.

69
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,960
It's Roronoa Zoro, the pirate hunter!

70
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,500
Whoa!

71
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,490
What?!

72
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,640
There should be othercrewmembers hiding, too.

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,000
If we could find even oneof
them, we'd get noticed!

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,760
Y-Yeah!

75
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,900
To think that Zoro was
caught...!What am I gonna do?!

76
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,860
According to what they just
said,everyone else seems to be okay.

77
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,600
Darn! I wanna get out of here already!But
I don't know where they are,

78
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,640
and I don't know what to do...

79
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,610
What's that?!

80
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,890
If I continue to live like this,I'll
break down before I get caught!

81
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,390
Hold it!

82
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,440
Help!!

83
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,280
Hold it!

84
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,990
So it wasn't me...

85
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,620
But I have to come up witha
different disguise... Hm?

86
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,300
This is it!

87
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,150
Th-This isn't good! It's a dead end!

88
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,550
The raccoon dog went that way!

89
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,310
All right! The corner is raccoon
dogged...no, the raccoon dog is cornered!

90
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,930
What should I do?! What should I do?!

91
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,510
He's not here.

92
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,920
So he really was a raccoon
dog.He disappeared!

93
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,790
Hm?

94
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,800
He's in there.

95
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,250
It'll be a lot of work finding him in here!

96
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,180
Ah!

97
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,680
Shh!

98
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,750
Here we go!

99
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,240
What're these?!

100
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,230
Did he leave just his antlers?!

101
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,280
Who knows? But with just antlers,we
can't even make a pot dish.

102
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,220
Dammit! Did we lose him on our way here?!

103
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,380
I'm saved...

104
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,920
Where is the package?

105
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,620
It's probably that way.

106
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,580
Ah! This is it!

107
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,200
What're they doing with deer antlers?

108
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,060
I heard that they'll be usedas
ingredients for medicine.

109
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,960
What?! What happened?!

110
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,220
They said that they ran into a
storm.Many were injured. Hurry it up!

111
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,850
Take them to the medical room quickly!

112
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,250
Let me see... Plunge the scalpelvertically,
and if it bleeds...

113
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,120
Blood, blood, blood...!

114
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,870
Honestly! Why did all the doctorshave
to go on a business trip at once?

115
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,050
Oh, God, please don'tsend
any surgery patients!

116
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,220
Medical Room Chief!

117
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes...

118
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,060
We brought the deer antlers,the
medicine ingredient.

119
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,590
Oh... Please leave them there.

120
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,610
Okay!

121
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,370
Where am I?

122
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,980
I look pretty good in this
uniform,if I do say so myself.

123
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,460
I'll be fine if I look like this!

124
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,380
Ugh! I'm sorry!

125
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,390
What're you apologizing for?!Go
to the medical room already!

126
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,050
What?! Hm? Huh?

127
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,970
There's an emergency!All the
nurses are being called in!

128
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,320
I knew it... I'm screwed
nomatter what clothes I wear!

129
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,310
Dr. Kobato! It's an emergency!

130
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,670
I-Internal case? Pediatrics? Or...

131
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,960
There're quite a few seriouslyinjured
marines on the Stan Marey!

132
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,580
S-Surgery?!

133
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,830
I-I'll leave them to you nurses,since
surgery isn't my field.

134
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,040
What're you saying?! You're theonly
doctor in this base right now!

135
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,140
But...! I'm a pediatrician and,um,
surgery is outside my field!

136
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,800
Oh... This seems to be a medical room.

137
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,650
But I wonder if that doctor
is gonna be okay...

138
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,370
One, two, three!

139
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,610
This is crazy! Did they runinto
a cyclone or something?!

140
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,080
Here, treat their injuries!

141
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,920
Okay!

142
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,360
Darn! I don't have time for stuff like this!

143
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,270
We have to quickly find the Going
Merryand leave this place right away!

144
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,090
I-I'm sorry!

145
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,620
Stop daydreaming!

146
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,940
Doctor, what should we do?!

147
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,490
Right... right... Give
him 50 mg of painkiller!

148
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,980
What about preparing the operation room?

149
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,850
Operation?! Operation...Yeah,
he needs an operation...

150
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,270
Doctor!

151
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,800
Doctor! There's no time to lose!

152
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,350
Please get a grip!

153
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,060
Please advise us on treating the patients!

154
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
Doctor...

155
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,990
I can't just stand back and watch!

156
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,280
I'll advise you all!

157
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,440
First, give this patient
phenicol,cardiotonic and tialcillin.

158
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,390
Respond if you got that!

159
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,510
Yes, doctor!

160
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,750
Perform cross-matchingwith
each patient's blood type!

161
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,220
Those who require an operation,give
them preoperative treatment!

162
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,160
Give that patient a tetanustoxoid
and 5 mg of morphine!

163
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,880
Yes, doctor!

164
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,990
Is the operation room ready?!

165
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,670
It's ready!

166
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,410
Then bring the patients in,starting
with seriously injured ones!

167
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,970
Yes, doctor!

168
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,660
Get a grip, doctor!

169
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,860
Chopper!

170
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,200
Nami! What are you doing
in a place like this?!

171
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,850
What're you doing here?!

172
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,950
Excuse me... I don't knowwhat's
going on, since I fainted...

173
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,610
You're... a doctor, right?

174
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,870
I don't know who you are, but yousaved
us with your apt instructions.

175
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,840
You're not saved yet!

176
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,600
What?!

177
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,250
There're a number of soldiers whose
livesare in danger without an operation!

178
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,460
Yes...

179
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,050
Start the operations on seriouslyinjured
patients as soon as possible!

180
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,140
Yes... Operations...

181
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,690
What's with you?!

182
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,400
I-I can't...

183
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,110
Can't do what?

184
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,500
I can't bear things like seeingpeople
in pain and bleeding at all.

185
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,650
When I'm really terrible
even at giving shots,

186
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,900
to think of cutting a human
bodyor putting stitches on it...

187
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,150
I can't believe this! This
is a naval base, right?!

188
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,000
How have you been giving treatmentsuntil
now if you're like this?!

189
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:29,080
My field is pediatrics. Since the
otherdoctors are all out on business trips,

190
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,970
I was asked to serve as
adeputy Medical Room Chief.

191
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,450
Deputy...?

192
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,140
Deputy or not, you're theMedical
Room Chief right now, right?!

193
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,090
Y-Yes, more or less...

194
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,810
More or less?!

195
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,720
Chopper! Let's get out of here already!

196
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,760
But...

197
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,350
We can get out! This place isn'ta
lake! It's connected to the sea!

198
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,740
We can get out with the Going Merry!

199
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,200
I can't go yet.

200
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,700
What?!

201
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,280
You're a doctor, a person thatsaves
people's lives, aren't you?!

202
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:05,290
Yes... but even for a doctor,there're
things they can and can't do...

203
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,420
The person who taught memedicine
told me this story.

204
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,510
There was a man who was told byhis
doctor that he was going to die.

205
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,090
He wandered in despair,searching
for a place to die.

206
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,910
But as he was passing over a mountain,

207
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,000
he saw vivid cherry blossomsblooming
all over the mountain.

208
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,600
He went to see a doctor again.And
the doctor said to him...

209
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,820
"You're completely healthy."

210
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,940
You're the only doctor to the patients here!

211
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,160
You're the only one who can save them!

212
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,350
You mustn't give up! There's no illnessin
this world that can't be healed!

213
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,870
You mustn't say thatthere're
things you can't do!

214
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,330
There're no patients thatwe
doctors can't heal!

215
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,310
Doctors can make miracles happen!At
least, we have to believe that!

216
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,710
Say...

217
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,090
...will I be able to seethe
cherry blossoms, too?

218
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,000
Or rather... can I show the cherryblossoms
to people who're suffering?

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,710
Yeah, of course! I'll help you!

220
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,710
H-Hey! We don't have time for that!

221
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:31,010
We don't, but people's lives havepriority
over anything! I'm a doctor!

222
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,240
Are you serious?! You'll get left
behind,you know! Is that what you want?!

223
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,400
Doctor, preparations forthe
operations are ready!

224
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,840
Okay! I'll be right over!

225
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,310
Chop... Dr. Chopper!

226
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,720
All right.

227
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,780
Chopper!

228
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,230
It's okay to leave me behind.

229
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,060
If I leave here now,I'll
be scolded by Doctorine!

230
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,890
Geez, you know we can'tjust
leave without you!

231
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,420
"Operating Room"

232
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,730
We had a doctor like that here?

233
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
We'll start the emergency operations.

234
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,260
There's a piece of iron in his
chest.We need to remove it.

235
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,630
The patient is already sleepingsoundly
from the anesthesia.

236
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,640
Scalpel!

237
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,080
Yes, doctor!

238
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,800
Dr. Kobato! You'll be fine!

239
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,680
You're the one who can showcherry
blossoms to this patient!

240
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,050
Yes!

241
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,230
It's near an artery, so be careful.

242
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,510
Yes.

243
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,450
Nami, suction!

244
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,150
Yes, doctor!

245
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,480
The iron piece has been removed.

246
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,320
I did it!

247
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,260
This is no time to celebrate!

248
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,130
There're many other patients!

249
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,500
Yes!

250
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,960
Let's give it our best!

251
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,670
Yes!

252
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,670
What?! A doctor you've neverseen
is performing an operation?

253
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,300
Yes, sir!

254
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,010
It might be one of the Straw Hats.

255
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,060
Chopper...

256
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,770
Pardon me!

257
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,060
We're in the middle ofan
operation. Please leave!

258
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,950
It's an emergency! Dr. Kobato,I
wanna ask you something.

259
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,800
Dr. Kobato! His blood pressure is dropping!

260
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,930
Give him 6 units of red blood
cellsuspension and 1 unit of platelets!

261
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,980
Yes, doctor!

262
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,320
It's all right. Continue the
bloodtransfusion! Also have dopamine ready!

263
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,200
Dr. Kobato!

264
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,100
We're in the middle of anemergency
operation! Please be quiet!

265
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,050
You're operating?! You fainted whenyou
saw blood flowing out of my arm!

266
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,560
A doctor we've never seenbefore
should be in there.

267
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,770
You're interrupting!

268
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,630
All you'll find in here are doctors and
nursesgiving their all to save precious lives!

269
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,380
Let's go.

270
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,910
Monitor them.

271
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,700
Yes, sir.

272
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,340
Suture completed!

273
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,270
Doctor, that was the last patient.

274
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,230
Good work, Dr. Kobato!

275
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,950
Ch-Chopper!

276
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,920
You're a great doctor, Dr. Kobato.

277
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,810
Not at all... but you are agreat
doctor, Mr. Raccoon Dog.

278
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,260
You dummy! I'm not araccoon
dog! I'm a reindeer!

279
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,810
Shouldn't she be rather surprisedto
see Chopper like that?

280
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,110
Honestly, what am I doing
in a place like this?!

281
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,120
We don't even know if Nami-sanand
Robin-chan are okay.

282
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,570
Ahh! But out of regard for Jessica-san,I
can't just abandon this task.

283
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,980
Yeah, exactly.

284
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,490
Hey, what're you doing?!

285
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,360
Well, I was watching this thingand
admiring how incredible it is.

286
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,090
Either help me out or come upwith
a way to get us out of here.

287
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,570
Just do something!

288
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,120
But I wonder why we're
notgetting out of this place?

289
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,100
It's come to this because you were dawdling!

290
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,470
Say, Sanji...

291
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,130
What?!

292
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,210
Octopuses can be eaten raw, right?

293
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,600
So what?!

294
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,600
How is it? Is your stuff ready?

295
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,600
If you take your time, the next100
soldiers are gonna show up.

296
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,750
Oh, Jessica-san! I've just finished it!

297
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,760
Oh, yeah?! It's finally
break time? I'm tired!

298
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,360
You didn't do anything!

299
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,300
Then I'd like you to chop up 300 more onions.

300
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,290
What?! Is she a devil?

301
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,090
Okay! I'm your servant, Jessica-san!

302
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,710
I get it! It's your fault
it's come to this, Sanji!

303
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

304
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

305
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

306
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,on
the road opened before us

307
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

308
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,610
We won't give in, we won't give
in,even if the obstacle is big

309
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:14,190
It's nothing to be scared
of,we can overcome it

310
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,340
Dammit! That bastard! That hurt!

311
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,420
Anyway, are the others okay?

312
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,780
Oh, hey, Usopp! Is our ship all right?!

313
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,550
Robin, why're you dressed like that?

314
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,920
Captain and the idiot
