2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:16,350
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,700
In pursuit of Nami and the others,
Luffy's group entered the Illusion Forest,

21
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,130
and were greeted with a rigorous
Ball Ordeal by the Priest Satori.

22
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,490
You're still alive? Impressive indeed!

23
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,130
Well, then, as a reward, I'll give
you my prized finishing blow!

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Meanwhile, Chopper, who was looking
after the ship alone on the sacrificial altar,

25
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,750
was attacked by Shura, one of the four priests.

26
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,510
No!

27
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,890
Offer your life... to God!

28
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,600
N-No!!

29
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,620
Die!

30
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,690
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

31
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,050
Sky Knight!!

32
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,520
You probably came here knowing this, but...

33
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,480
...you're already a criminal!

34
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,530
Ahh, I'll show you what I do
to aggravating fools like you!!

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,900
String Ordeal!

36
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,910
"Profound Mystery!
Ordeal of String and Ordeal of Love?!"

37
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,130
Ah! That's...!

38
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,450
Come out! Ball Dragon!

39
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,810
Oh, it's just a bunch of
surprise clouds put together.

40
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,210
Are we supposed to be surprised by that?

41
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,470
I'll have you know, it's made up of surprise
clouds containing explosives or sharp objects.

42
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,660
What?! Then that means...!

43
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,430
You touch the fire-bomb ball
somewhere on its body and it's over.

44
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,660
One explosion will cause another,

45
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,700
and its gigantic body will
instantly cause a huge explosion!

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,700
Surprise Balls! Go, Ball Dragon!

47
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,630
Gum-Gum... Pistol!!

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,850
No! Wait, Luffy!!

49
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,980
Whatever you do, don't touch that thing!!

50
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,320
If you lay even one finger on it,

51
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,680
we'll be blown to bits!

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,480
How are we gonna fight it if we can't touch it?!

53
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,260
Exactly! Forget about fighting that thing!

54
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,270
Our only option is to run!

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,600
So we just keep running?!

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,340
How should I know?!

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,830
Here it comes!! Jump!!

58
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,760
Why'd we hafta land here?!

59
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,010
You're quite the stubborn ones.

60
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,570
It's the same result either way!

61
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,620
But if you died before you
experienced the power of Ball Dragon...

62
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,570
...it wouldn't be fun!

63
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,060
Aisa!

64
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,180
Where have you been?

65
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,180
Ah! Kamakiri!

66
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,830
Upper Yard again? That's
Vearth in your bag, isn't it?

67
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,130
Don't go there too often...

68
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,390
...or you'll lose your life.

69
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,740
Bahhhh! Don't tell me what to do!

70
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,840
You haven't even been able to beat Eneru yet!

71
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,720
That damn brat!

72
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,290
A chance?

73
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,450
That's right.

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,890
For some reason, Gan Fall entered Upper Yard.

75
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,980
That old geezer thinks that he can
settle everything in Skypiea peacefully.

76
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,820
He's got it all wrong.

77
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,790
Win or lose... Those are the
only two outcomes in a battle.

78
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,260
"Wyper Shandian
(a warrior of Shandora)"

79
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,260
The Great Warrior Calgara said,
"Light the fire of Shandora."

80
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,880
We'll follow those words.

81
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,750
It doesn't matter who we have to fight--
the former God Gan Fall, or Eneru.

82
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,150
So long as they reign as "God,"

83
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,910
no matter what their differences are,

84
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,690
to us they're the same!

85
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,020
They all have to be eliminated!

86
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Wyper.

87
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,950
Hm?

88
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,600
A rebel against Eneru
appeared on Angel Island.

89
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,570
I heard it's a young woman.

90
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,460
It's been six years since Eneru started reigning,

91
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,900
and this is the first time.

92
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,040
So what?

93
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,800
Since Gan Fall saved her from judgment,

94
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,090
Eneru now has a reason to
judge even the former God.

95
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,100
Gan Fall has never harmed any of us,

96
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:25,050
not only as the Sky Knight,
but also as the former God...

97
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,850
...nor has he tried to directly
confront Eneru, either.

98
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,640
That very man finally stepped into Upper Yard.

99
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,200
And if he and one of the priests
kill each other, that'd be great.

100
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,900
Or do you mean to say that
Gan Fall is no longer our enemy?

101
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,940
When men have a common enemy,

102
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,410
they get deluded into thinking
that the one next to them is an ally.

103
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,870
If you have doubts,
then stay out of the fight, Laki!

104
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,740
You'll only be in our way!

105
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,950
Aisa!

106
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,600
What?! I didn't go to Upper Yard!

107
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,710
Don't go into the tent yet.

108
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,100
Wyper, or rather, the man descended
from the Great Warrior Calgara, is angry.

109
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,290
Yeah, that's scary.

110
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,840
He's scarier than God.

111
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,280
Help... them?

112
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,040
Us?

113
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,640
Yes, that's right.

114
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,370
Let's try to create a way for
them to escape somehow.

115
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,900
I can't tell what they're doing... Amazing!

116
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,370
I no longer think that I can
negotiate with your group!

117
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,680
Ha! You're as soft as ever!

118
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,740
What is this fight?

119
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,320
Heaven's Judgment...

120
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,620
That young woman did something foolish.

121
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,660
We are never to... anger God Eneru.

122
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,510
Please come back...

123
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,940
...God!

124
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,700
I got you.

125
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,990
Is something wrong, Gan Fall?!

126
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,280
What did you do?!

127
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,490
Why...?! Why can't we move?!

128
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,370
You won't need the answer...

129
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,450
...when you're dead!

130
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,330
Profound mystery... String Ordeal!

131
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,100
You can enter Upper Yard, but you have to
face difficult ordeals from us, the four priests!

132
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,050
Don't think they can be beaten so easily!

133
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,060
God Eneru is...

134
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,620
...someone who is glorious and distant.

135
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,400
That's right. The sacred
ground will sing again...

136
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,710
...someday, for sure...

137
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,430
Sky...

138
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,890
Sky Knight!!

139
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,730
I've gotta save him. I've gotta save him!

140
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,260
There're skysharks here!

141
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,400
The Sky Knight'll be eaten by them!

142
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,380
Ha! Think of it as Eneru-sama's anger!

143
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,710
B-But how can I save him?

144
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,090
I can't swim... and I'll be
eaten by the skysharks, too.

145
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,570
He says not to harm his friends.

146
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,210
He says not to damage the ship.

147
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,120
He says he doesn't want to die.

148
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,090
What a dilemma.

149
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,470
Such a damned selfish animal!

150
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,530
He really irks me!

151
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,810
If you want to live so much,
then why are you so weak?!

152
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,960
Damn you!

153
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,980
Sky Knight?! Hah! You were forced out
from your position as God, you old fool!

154
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,530
In the end, you were no
match for us, the priests.

155
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,530
Ahhhhh!

156
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,470
Sky Knight!!

157
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,090
Ha! You're a Zoan, aren't you?!

158
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,680
Are you stupid? You can't even swim!

159
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,570
Oh, yeah, you're a Zoan, too.

160
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,790
How inconvenient...

161
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,480
Why don't you follow your master?!

162
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,320
Ahh, how absurd!

163
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,450
I can't stand how weak they all are.

164
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,230
If this was a bottomless river,
there'd still have been some hope.

165
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,730
But unfortunately,
this river does have a bottom.

166
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,500
Let's see... I wonder if those three
escapees have already been hunted.

167
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,150
Is that well that strange?

168
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,740
Yes. It's unbelievable that a well
would be stuck underneath a tree.

169
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,900
The balance between civilization
and nature here is off.

170
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,880
Well, in any case, unless we come up
with a way to cross this cloud river,

171
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,210
we can't walk around this forest.

172
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,730
We're far from meeting God.

173
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,840
The civilization couldn't
estimate the growth of this tree.

174
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,510
I've never seen a case like this before.

175
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,950
Hey, Nami! Can you see
anything from up there?!

176
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,490
The island where God lives... Upper Yard...

177
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,080
Hey! Say something! Did you find God?!

178
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,410
I wonder if she saw something.

179
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,730
This island... Can't be...!

180
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,500
You're pretty much dead.
Hurry up and rest in peace.

181
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,540
I'm a priest. There's no way you can win.

182
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,180
I-I can't go on anymore!
My heart can't take any more surprises.

183
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,170
Soon, you'll be out of options.

184
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,070
Your boat has nearly reached this forest's exit.

185
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,780
When that happens, it's all over!

186
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,960
So long as you can't fly like birds,

187
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,570
you won't be able to get out of here.

188
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,320
You'll wander around in this
forest and die of exhaustion!

189
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,760
That won't...

190
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,120
...happen!!

191
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,380
It will!

192
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,260
Surprise Balls!

193
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,050
Ball Dragon!

194
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,980
Now, it's show time!

195
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,590
Which one is the fire-bomb ball?

196
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,000
Touch it, and there'll be an
astonishingly huge explosion!

197
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,270
Good, now's the time. We can still make it!

198
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,360
I'll leave things here to you, Luffy!

199
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,180
Hm?

200
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,170
Oh? You're gonna climb up that tree to escape?

201
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,030
Why can he read my mind?!

202
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,630
Don't follow me!!

203
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,020
Wh-What?!

204
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,470
Oh, I see!

205
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,910
It was controlled by this string.

206
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,190
I'll take care...

207
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,520
...of this thing!

208
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,490
I can't control Ball Dragon anymore!

209
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,280
What impudence!

210
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Just hang on and come to me!!

211
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,690
Hey, don't hang on with the other hand, too!

212
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
There it is!!

213
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,230
So I was right! There's no doubt! That's the exit!

214
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,700
Of course! Why didn't I think of this sooner?

215
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,710
We fell from such a high place.

216
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,140
It's natural that the exit is at the same height!

217
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,410
Now that I know where the exit is,
the boat rule doesn't matter!

218
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,970
I have to hurry. I'm worried about
that huge explosion earlier.

219
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,290
They'd better be okay!

220
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:54,980
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

221
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,050
That was close! What an unbelievable idiot!

222
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,460
No, he might've been
determined to take me with him.

223
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,480
This isn't good. I'm still insufficiently trained!

224
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,850
He took control of the pace for a second!

225
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,500
If I can't stay calm over a little thing like this,

226
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,580
it'll hinder my Mantra!

227
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,470
You're right!

228
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,290
That was close!

229
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,250
Ah! You're still alive?!

230
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,080
Ahhh! Get off of me! You idiot!

231
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,700
Don't stick to me, you weirdo!

232
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,820
I said get off of me, now! You idiot! Idiot!

233
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,680
Don't let him go, Luffy!

234
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,680
Get off of me!

235
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,850
Don't ever let go of that doughboy!

236
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,480
You...!

237
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,700
Oh, Sanji! You're alive?!

238
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,370
I almost died because of you!!

239
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,240
Pay more attention to others!

240
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,520
Well, in any case, doughboy...

241
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,310
You keep saying "ordeal this," "ordeal that,"

242
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,350
but frankly, it's got nothing to do with us.

243
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,810
However, we accept that stupid sky ordeal...

244
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,270
...because two helpless ladies are
waiting for me to come to their rescue.

245
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,760
In other words, yes...

246
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,220
...this is... a love ordeal!

247
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,350
Is this guy an idiot, too?!

248
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,350
Ahh! I said get off of me!!

249
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,960
Y-You! You! Dammit! Let me go!

250
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,650
You guys play dirty, attacking two on one!

251
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,830
You creeps kidnapped our friends.

252
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,120
You made a cute angel cry and tried to kill her.

253
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,860
You have no right to say we play dirty.

254
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,540
He's right.

255
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,340
It's amazing that you can
predict our movements.

256
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,780
But even if you can predict them,

257
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,190
it doesn't mean anything if
you can't avoid them, does it?

258
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,180
I-Idiots! Stop it! I'm one of
the priests that serve God!

259
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,350
Let me go! Hey, are you listening?!

260
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,390
Not being judged by a priest is
a 1st degree crime in Skypiea!

261
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,280
Now listen here! Attacking me means you
declare war on the Almighty God Eneru!

262
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,850
Shut your mouth! Or the flavor will escape.

263
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,180
For example, when you want to produce
the supreme mignonnette from pepper...

264
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,670
...the important thing is to, strongly, roughly

265
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,910
and without hesitation, beat it to a pulp.

266
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,420
Then, the wonderful flavor
confined inside will be...

267
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,380
Ahhh! Ahhh! Stop it!

268
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,260
Ahhh! Stop it! Stop it!

269
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,140
It's gonna hurt! So stop it!

270
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,390
Concasser!

271
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Even if we're far apart

272
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,740
I don't want you to forget

273
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:38,420
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

274
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,000
You have a friend here to share the pain

275
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:52,600
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

276
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,100
I won't let it just be a dream

277
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,820
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

278
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:13,580
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

279
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,860
Phew, it's finally quiet. What's the next ordeal?

280
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,000
After a love ordeal is,
of course, a romance ordeal!

281
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,610
Follow me! We have to
somehow get to the seashore.

282
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,660
It looks like things're gonna get crazy!

283
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,000
This is our chance!

284
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,870
Today we'll definitely crush the
priests and take Upper Yard back!

285
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,700
On the next episode of One Piece!

286
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,440
"Light the Fire of Shandora! Wyper, the Warrior"

287
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,700
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
