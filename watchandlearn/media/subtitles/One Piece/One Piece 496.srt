2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,350
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,150
Luffy is consumed with sorrow.

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,450
Meanwhile, there is an untold story of the
brothers Luffy and Ace from 10 years ago.

62
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,500
"To The Sea Someday! The
Pledge of the Three Brats!"

63
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,470
Here I come!

64
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,470
Gum-Gum...

65
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,300
...Pistol!

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,810
Now tell me...

67
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,190
What are you doing?!

68
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,060
One point!

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,500
I won't lose a fight!

70
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,770
And I will...

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,230
I wanna get stronger!

72
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm gonna get stronger and I will...

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,390
I win, Sabo!

74
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,770
Dammit!

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,460
Damn! It's always a close
match between Ace and Sabo!

76
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,240
Sabo! You gotta fight me next!

77
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,860
Shouldn't you run?! I have no mercy!

78
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,870
Gum-Gum...

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,160
"Gum" again?

80
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,580
...Shield!

81
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,090
That's just stretching your fingers...

82
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,060
How interesting is this?

83
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,380
N-N-No, stop it!

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,060
Like I keep saying,

85
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,560
is there any point in having that power?

86
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,930
Dammit! It's not working! It was so close!

87
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,610
One more time!

88
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,290
No! The rule is only 100
matches per person a day.

89
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,880
Wait until tomorrow.

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,540
Luffy lost 50 times to me and Ace.

91
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,100
Me vs. Ace is 24 - 26.

92
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,920
I lost by 2. Dammit!

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,300
You guys! When I become 10 years
old, I'll beat you two up!

94
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,930
We'll be 13 then. Let's go
get something for dinner.

95
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,810
Okay, let's go for crocodiles!

96
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,150
I love crocodile meat!

97
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,150
Luffy, don't get eaten this time.

98
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,360
You were okay the last time
because you were swallowed whole.

99
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,570
You wait here, Luffy. You can't
swim so you'd slow us dow...

100
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,660
Crocodile meat!

101
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,300
--What?!
--I said "wait"!!

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,220
The harsh environment of Mt. Corvo
made them stronger day by day.

103
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,610
On the north side of this mountain,

104
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,560
there is the place where all uncertain
things end up called Gray Terminal.

105
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,700
And on the north side of the Terminal,

106
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,290
there is a city with a solid stone
wall that doesn't let anyone enter.

107
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,920
The only entrance to the city
is called the Great Gate

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:32,010
through which twice daily passes mountains
of junk from all over the country.

109
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,260
--Oh, here they come!
--let's go treasure hunting!

110
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,940
Residents of Gray Terminal visit the city
sometimes to sell recycled products.

111
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,310
Hey wait! What's in that package?

112
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,080
It's a crocodile-skin. I'm here to sell it.

113
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Crocodile?

114
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,250
G-Go ahead!

115
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,170
Beyond the Great Gate, there is a boulevard
where all passersby can be clearly seen

116
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,840
and then there is Edge Town.

117
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,930
Edge Town - where all the thugs and
gangsters from the city hang out.

118
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,900
Hey, pops! Leave your package here!

119
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,080
Hey, why don't you say something?!

120
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,580
Shut up, you punk.

121
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,790
What?!

122
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,670
Y-You little...

123
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,380
When you mug somebody,

124
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,760
be careful who you pick!

125
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,680
Th-They are the...

126
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,890
Let's do this!

127
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,100
--Okay!
--Okay!

128
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,450
In the middle of the walled city,
there is another high stone wall

129
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,350
which encloses High Town where
royalty and nobles live.

130
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,590
The name of this country is the Goa Kingdom.

131
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,960
There is no garbage on streets

132
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,640
and it is said
to be the most beautiful country in the East Blue.

133
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,600
Windmill Village where Luffy was born...

134
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,020
...is the part of the kingdom even
though it's a forgotten backwater.

135
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,530
DOWNTOWN

136
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,660
I'm glad they paid so much for the skin!

137
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,410
We got more for the "pirate savings"!

138
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,910
I'm hungry!

139
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,830
Just a little longer. We'll
have great ramen noodles!

140
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,250
What is ramen? Is it really good?

141
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,920
Whatever's fine! I wanna eat soon!

142
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,220
FINE DINING EIICHIRO

143
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,890
This is the restaurant!

144
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,600
Hi, may I help you?

145
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,350
W-W-Wait a minute!

146
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,820
What are you doing?! People
like you are not allowed here!

147
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,400
The VIP room will do.

148
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,490
Th-That mark is...!

149
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,160
We're so honored to have a noble
like you come to our restaurant!

150
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,250
We'll prepare a room right away!

151
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,800
That thing is pretty handy!

152
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,260
Yeah, I found it on the street a while ago.

153
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,640
Here are 3 ramen noodle bowls!
Thank you for waiting!

154
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,770
Enjoy your meal!

155
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,270
This is ramen?!

156
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,440
It looks good!

157
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,320
Well, try it.

158
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,700
Yum-yum!

159
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,370
Yeah, it is good!

160
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,370
I want more!

161
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,340
I need more. 3 more ramen noodles!

162
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,210
Yes, sir! Here they are!

163
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,210
More please!

164
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,110
Y-Yes, sir!

165
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,970
More!

166
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,300
Y-Yes, sir! Right away!

167
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,640
Next!

168
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,490
May I come in?

169
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,200
M-Manager!

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,410
Are you sure?!

171
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,380
Sir, we need to talk!

172
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,420
--Damn, they found out!
--Let's go!

173
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,760
They didn't pay!

174
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,920
Catch them, somebody!

175
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,240
--The ramen noodles were great!
--I told you!

176
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,310
--Catch them?!
--They're only kids!

177
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,270
I-It's them again! They're such
pests! Why were they let in?!

178
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,700
Don't let them run away!
Somebody catch those 3 kids!

179
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,120
I can't believe that they
jumped out of the window!

180
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,040
This is the 4th floor!

181
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,170
We lost 26 bowls of ramen
noodles and a window!

182
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,290
M-Manager! They left a note!

183
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:08,470
TREASURE TAB - LUFFY

184
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,410
"Treasure tab"?!

185
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,310
Sabo?

186
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,150
That must be Sabo! Wait!

187
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,440
You're alive!

188
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,600
Let's go home!

189
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,610
Hey, Sabo! He's calling you!

190
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,920
Who is that?

191
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,070
He confused me with someone else. Let's go!

192
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,330
W-Wait!

193
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,000
Sabo...

194
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,620
What?! I'm not hiding anything!

195
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,580
Oh, you aren't?

196
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,460
Yes, you are! Tell us, Sabo!

197
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,130
We can't have secrets among us!

198
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,970
--Tell us!
--Tell us!

199
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,730
I said that I'm not hiding...

200
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,790
Tell us, you bastard! Or I'll beat you up!

201
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,190
Alright, I'll tell you!

202
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,900
The son of a noble?!

203
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,170
--Who is it?
--Who is it?

204
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,480
I am!

205
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,960
--And?
--And?

206
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,870
You two asked me first!

207
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,110
The truth is, both of my parents are alive.

208
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,510
So I'm not an orphan and I didn't
grow up in the Gray Terminal.

209
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,200
The man who called to me today was...

210
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,810
...my father.

211
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,920
I was lying to you guys. I'm sorry.

212
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,870
He said "sorry" so we gotta forgive him.

213
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,440
Let's hold off on forgiveness -
it all depends on your motive.

214
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,110
Why were you living there if
you are from a noble family?

215
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,280
The reason I ran away was...

216
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,170
Listen, Sabo.

217
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,460
You must acquire intelligence and
knowledge that you'll need as a noble

218
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,300
and become a man that can marry
a woman from the royal family.

219
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,350
Then, we will live in security and
I'm sure that you will live happily!

220
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,600
Are you sure that if I could marry
a royal woman, I'll live happily?

221
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm sure!

222
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,340
Yes, Sabo!

223
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,170
Okay!

224
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,990
I'll do it!

225
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,830
What?!

226
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,540
The cargo ship has sunk?!

227
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,410
I don't give a damn about the crew!

228
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,040
What are you gonna do about the
cargo that I paid for? Huh?

229
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,800
Hello?! Hello?!

230
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,500
--Clank.
--Damn!

231
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,160
Such a great loss! By thunder!

232
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,550
Dad!

233
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,770
DAD

234
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,770
Look at this! I drew it!

235
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,860
I'm exhausted from work, Sabo.

236
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,550
If you have time to draw this,
you ought to be studying instead.

237
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,690
Hey, you!

238
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm from the royal family!
Which means I'm related to the king!

239
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,890
Carry me by piggyback to my house!

240
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,470
Stop, you rude jerk!

241
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,480
Hey, are you gonna ignore my royal order?!

242
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Let me go!

243
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,990
You're just the son of some noble family!

244
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,810
I'll teach you a lesson!

245
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,790
Don't!

246
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,420
It's unforgivable to harm a
child of the royal family!

247
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,050
Sabo! Did you really have a fight
with this royal boy?!

248
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,840
Yes, I did!

249
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,430
Because he attacked me with
a knife all of a sudden...

250
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,110
I'm sorry! Did you get hurt?!

251
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,280
I'm so sorry!

252
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,450
Let's take him to a doctor
to get checked out!

253
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,580
Can we please settle this matter peacefully?!

254
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,520
They love those who can maintain their
status and defend their property.

255
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,170
Not me!

256
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,850
If I can't marry a woman from
the royal family, I'm worthless!

257
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,980
That's why they made me study
and take culture lessons.

258
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,480
And they were arguing everyday
because I wasn't doing well.

259
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,840
I had no place to be in that family!

260
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,510
I'm sorry for both of you but I was
all by myself even if I had parents!

261
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:07,000
I heard that you sneak out
and go somewhere sometimes.

262
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,790
I don't think you do but do you
ever go to the Gray Terminal!

263
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,890
We nobles are privileged to live

264
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,550
in the High Town with
the king and his family.

265
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:23,400
Those residents there and we nobles
are living in different worlds!

266
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,190
It's you again.

267
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,320
If you walk around a place like this,

268
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,740
you might get robbed and killed someday!

269
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,790
Let me hear the stories again!

270
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,550
About countries across the sea

271
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,580
that you guys have seen or visited!

272
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,090
--You're a strange kid!
--Come and sit down.

273
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,180
Uh-huh!

274
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,050
Nobles have a low opinion
of the Gray Terminal

275
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,970
but it's better than the stifling High Town

276
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,400
where your life has been
arranged for years to come!

277
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,780
I see.

278
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,860
Ace! Luffy!

279
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,980
We gotta set out to sea someday!

280
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,950
Let's get out of this
country and live freely!

281
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,580
I wanna see the world out there
and write a book about it!

282
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,490
I'm happy to study if it's about sailing!

283
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,670
Let's become stronger and
become pirates someday!

284
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,510
I'm gonna become one - you
don't have to tell me to!

285
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:55,230
I'm gonna become a pirate and
defeat others and become infamous!

286
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,820
It'll be the only proof of my life!

287
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,740
It doesn't matter if all the people
in the world reject me or despise me,

288
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,660
I'll become a great pirate
and show them what I can do!

289
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,540
I won't run from anybody or lose to anyone!

290
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,520
Because I'm feared or hated or whatever,

291
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,000
my name will be known all over!

292
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,600
I got it! Alright then...!

293
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,890
I'm gonna become...!

294
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,730
You fool... I was wondering
what you'd have to say...

295
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,320
You're funny, Luffy!

296
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,200
I can't wait to see how you
turn out in the future!

297
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,900
We can all become pirates

298
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,910
but isn't it a problem that
we all wanna become captain?

299
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,120
I wasn't expecting that.

300
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,960
Sabo, I thought that you'd wanna
be navigator on my ship.

301
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,250
You guys can come aboard my ship!

302
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,420
--No thanks!
--No thanks!

303
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,950
Huh?! Come on!

304
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,930
Come aboard! I said "come
aboard", so you gotta do it!

305
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,510
--That will never happen!
--Yeah, never!

306
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,100
What did you say?!

307
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,420
But that's okay.

308
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,850
What's that?!

309
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,640
Man, you're funny, Luffy!

310
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,320
Well, let's just leave
it until the time comes.

311
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,950
Maybe we'll set out independently.

312
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,400
Oh, you stole that from Dadan!

313
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,150
Did you guys know?!

314
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,730
We can become brothers if we
exchange this cup of sake!

315
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,220
Brothers? Really?!

316
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,010
When we become pirates, we
might not be on the same ship

317
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,310
but our brotherhood will always be with us!

318
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,060
Wherever, whatever, we'll
always be bonded together!

319
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,820
So from now on,

320
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,980
we're brothers!

321
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,380
Yeah!!

322
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,170
Dreaming of the day when they'll
