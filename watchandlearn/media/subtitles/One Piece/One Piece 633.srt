We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,640
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,380
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,430
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law.

75
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,500
Now, they have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,670
Their plan was to destroy the SMILE

77
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,470
manufacturing factory and rescue a samurai

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,940
but after Zoro's sword was stolen,
they got separated.

79
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,850
Please! Hold me!

80
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,400
Or I will... fall for you.

81
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,310
　　　　　　　　　　　　BANG!!

82
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,770
My name is Violet.

83
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,690
Could you escort me to the next town
if you don't mind?

84
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,910
The next town?

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
And...

86
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,480
...I want you to kill someone!

87
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,480
What?

88
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,280
The champion will get a Devil Fruit?!

89
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,510
On top of that, it's none
other than "Fire-Fist" Ace's

90
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,760
Flare-Flare Fruit?!

91
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,330
Oh, here, here! I want to enter!

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,420
Enter! Enter! Enter! Enter!

93
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,410
What?

94
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,600
What?!

95
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,280
No, you don't! You're too old!

96
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,980
"A Formidable, Unknown Warrior!
Here Comes Lucy!"

97
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,650
Grandpa, I'm currently accepting

98
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,960
entries for the competition
in the Corrida Colosseum.

99
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,900
I know! I'm entering!

100
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,730
Huh? Does that old man want to enter?

101
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,220
Is he nuts?

102
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,370
Does he have any idea about
the other competitors?!

103
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,960
I don't think so.

104
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,930
Because, in addition to
all those powerful people

105
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,480
from the New World, looking
to win the Flare-Flare Fruit,

106
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,050
there are some formidable fighters
from the Don Quixote Family!

107
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey Luffy, listen. Promise me just one thing.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,730
You can fight as you like

109
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,580
but don't ever let them know who you are.

110
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,660
Okay!

111
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,990
Sign your name.

112
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,960
Luf...

113
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,290
You idiot!

114
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,340
Beyond this point, competitors only.

115
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,770
Follow me.

116
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,090
Just go ahead and beat them all up.

117
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,820
But keep a low profile.

118
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,440
Count on me!

119
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,830
I'll be back with the Flare-Flare Fruit!

120
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,950
As I thought, she entered. Rebecca...

121
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,530
Hey.

122
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,900
Huh?! Wh-What do you want?!

123
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,220
Were you born in this country?

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,620
Of course! I was born and raised here!
I'm a pure Dressrosan!

125
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,090
I see.

126
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,480
Can I ask you something?

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,340
Do you know if the big guns of
the Don Quixote Family

128
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,830
are here today?

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,420
Don Quixote?!

130
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,200
Keep it down!

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,560
Do you know or not?

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,180
Why do you wanna know such a thing?!

133
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,210
I can't tell you why.

134
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,620
Alright, then do you know something
about the factory?

135
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,750
Th-The factory?!

136
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,920
I said "Keep it down"!

137
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,850
Thank you!

138
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,470
Huh?

139
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,510
The food was really amazing!

140
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,660
Now I know.

141
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,230
I've been improving my
skill in cooking but...

142
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,950
...it was all for Violet-chan!

143
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,890
That's so...

144
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,660
Thank you!

145
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,200
Somebody's coming again!

146
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,420
This way!

147
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,280
Yes! I will follow you
to the end of the world!

148
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,700
Oh! We're like runaway lovers!

149
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,530
The more they chase us, the closer we get!

150
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,100
The more we turn the world against us,

151
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,950
the more the flame of our love burns!

152
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,770
I wish this happiness would last forever!

153
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,790
They can easily spot us if we keep running.
Let's walk.

154
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,130
Okay! Oh?

155
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,220
It was a short-lived dream.

156
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,380
What?

157
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,570
Th-Th-This is...

158
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,320
Let's go.

159
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,540
This is the dressing room
for the competitors.

160
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,120
You're free until we call you.

161
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,610
Wow! It's filled with excitement!

162
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,040
The Flare-Flare Fruit is mine!

163
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,020
No, it's mine, idiot!

164
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,400
Move! You're in my way!

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,510
What did you say?!

166
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,370
Hey, who is that little guy?

167
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,160
I see.

168
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,530
Can we use any weapons we like?

169
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,200
Hey, who is he?

170
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,070
Oh, he's the last person to enter.

171
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,690
What is that little guy here for?

172
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,740
This is the kind of joke I hate the most!

173
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,650
SPARTAN - A GLADIATOR AT THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM
(WON A MONTHLY TOURNAMENT 51 TIMES)

174
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,840
Hey, fake-bearded brat!
This is a fighting arena!

175
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,340
Don't, Spartan!

176
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,890
It's no fun seeing a weakling get pummeled!

177
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,050
The spectators only get excited
when the strong go head-to-head!

178
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,090
This is not a place for you! Go home!

179
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,100
Go home now!

180
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,280
Nice to meet ya!

181
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,680
Hey, what's wrong with that little guy?!

182
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,870
He took down Spartan!

183
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,380
No way!

184
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,220
He's one of the star gladiators
of this Colosseum!

185
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,600
Maybe, he just tripped over himself.

186
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,560
That wouldn't lodge someone in the ground!

187
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,080
Now, where should I sit?

188
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,610
Did you just start that fight?!

189
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,370
You'll have to leave now!
You're disqualified!

190
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,620
What?!

191
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,580
We don't need hooligans like you
causing scuffles before a match...

192
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,300
Whoa-whoa!

193
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,870
Hold it right there, you fool!

194
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,700
That big one started it!

195
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,500
If you wanna throw someone
out, it's got to be him!

196
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,090
He passed out though.

197
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,110
Oh! It's Sai and Boo from the Kano Kingdom!

198
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,530
Even Don Chinjao is here!

199
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,970
He's a legend!

200
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,440
SAI OF THE CHINJAO FAMILY -
A GANG FROM THE KANO KINGDOM

201
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,840
BOO OF THE CHINJAO FAMILY -
A GANG FROM THE KANO KINGDOM

202
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,300
DON CHINJAO - A LEADER IN THE CHINJAO FAMILY -
A GANG FROM THE KANO KINGDOM

203
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,870
Is it true?

204
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,370
Yeah, it is. Spartan started it.

205
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,310
I see.

206
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,080
Then Spartan has to go.

207
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,100
Lucy, you can stay.

208
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Okay!

209
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,880
You saved me! Thank you!

210
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,370
Don't mention it, fool!

211
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,700
Boy, you don't have to mention it...

212
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,100
You don't have to say "Thank you"...

213
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,370
I don't like to hear the words "Thank you."

214
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,180
Take back your "Thank you," you bastard!

215
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,480
You don't have to refuse
his thanks that much, brother!

216
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,410
Don't ever say those words to me, idiot!

217
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,240
Sorry. He's easily excitable.

218
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,290
There are all kinds of people in the world.

219
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,790
Hey! Stop ganging up with other powerhouses
in your block, Dagama!

220
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,770
Huh? What the hell are you
talking about, Kelly Funk?

221
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,940
Hey hey, look at them.

222
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,770
Yeah, there are a whole bunch

223
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,640
of big names from each and every country!

224
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,600
FUNK BROTHERS
ASSASSINS FROM A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY

225
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,980
It's like a war for the Devil Fruit between nations!

226
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,320
KELLY FUNK
(THE OLDER OF THE TWO BROTHERS)

227
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,770
Ganging up and paying people off?

228
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,320
Hey, you make me sick!

229
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:52,290
BOBBY FUNK
(THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO BROTHERS)

230
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,070
It's an individual fight.

231
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,430
Even if you cheat like that, only one winner per block

232
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,290
can go to the next round.

233
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:58,350
DAGAMA
A TACTICIAN OF THE PRODENCE KINGDOM

234
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,780
Cut that crap!

235
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,510
I know you two are here on your country's order, too!

236
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,300
Possessing the Flare-Flare Fruit,

237
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,030
which is more powerful than any weapon,

238
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,600
ELIZABELLO II - "THE FIGHTING KING"
THE KING OF THE PRODENCE KINGDOM

239
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,500
would give any country an

240
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,020
advantage in diplomatic relations.

241
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,440
Look around you. See those faces?

242
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,690
There! He is a class-A war criminal

243
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,880
who was involved in the Sea Battle of Dias
- Suleiman the beheader!

244
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,400
They're former bounty hunters

245
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,190
who bombed a government
institution - Abdullah and Jeet.

246
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,090
He's a fake adventurer -
"The Surmounter" Orlumbus.

247
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,080
He's sponsored by the Don Quixote Family -

248
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,300
a sadistic pirate who's worth over 100 million -
Bellamy the Hyena.

249
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,760
And "Pirate Noble" Cavendish is here...

250
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,790
...as well as the crazy rookie Bartolomeo

251
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,310
who became notorious a year ago.

252
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,690
Now, do you really think all
of these ill-famed people

253
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,880
are not plotting anything?!

254
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,420
It's crazy if they don't have a plan!

255
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,260
I'm sure you guys have something! Don't you?

256
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,650
Hey, aren't you gonna serve food?

257
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,630
No.

258
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,500
The first round is a battle royal.

259
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,360
Only one winner per block
will go to the next round.

260
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,550
Yeah!

261
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,770
Block A's match will start soon!

262
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,970
And then, B, C, and D will follow.

263
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,760
There are 550 competitors here.

264
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,680
And only four of us may win the first round!

265
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,270
It's not that easy to win.

266
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,420
So I guess...

267
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,020
...you brothers are in
the same block because

268
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,580
of paying somebody off, am I right?

269
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,860
It's just a coincidence.

270
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,270
It's a coincidence.

271
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,980
Which block am I in?

272
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm sure the receptionist told you already.

273
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,700
Your number is 556 so you're in Block C.

274
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,780
I know everybody has a different purpose

275
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,620
but the world could fall
into chaos depending on

276
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,710
who gets the Flare-Flare Fruit.

277
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,450
Let's cut the crap and
do our best, everybody!

278
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,990
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting!

279
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,860
Let me explain about today's competition!

280
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,290
For the first round, competitors
are divided into four blocks

281
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,580
and it's gonna be a battle royal!

282
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,410
A battle royal is a match in which
all competitors fight at once

283
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,020
so everybody is your enemy except yourself!

284
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,920
And the last one standing without being

285
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,460
eliminated
or getting killed will be the winner!

286
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,700
A competitor will be
eliminated if he gets thrown

287
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,760
out of the ring or if he
gets killed in the ring!

288
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,690
Meanwhile, in the water outside of the ring,

289
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,320
the Colosseum's unique attraction -

290
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,760
a school of Little Fighting Fish are
waiting to attack whoever falls!

291
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,050
Doesn't matter if you're
in or out of the ring!

292
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,480
It's Hell! That's the Corrida Colosseum!

293
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,080
We're about to get started!

294
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,920
All right!

295
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,030
It's the first round of the special
event in the Corrida Colosseum!

296
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,570
A battle royal of the
Block A - 137 competitors!

297
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,770
Let the battle begin!

298
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,410
Take this!

299
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,080
Armor! Helmets!

300
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,290
This is awesome!
Can we use anything here?!

301
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,500
You can use anything
except projectile weapons.

302
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,420
A half-naked statue of an old warrior man!

303
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,240
Cool!

304
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,980
Can I have it?!

305
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,760
No.

306
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,330
I will wear this armor!

307
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,240
And a helmet that's cooler
than that old man's!

308
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,120
Oh! This is good, too!

309
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,890
I'm gonna use this big sword!

310
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,180
This is nice! I look awesome!

311
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,720
So cool!

312
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,500
I wish Usopp and the others
were here to see me!

313
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,010
Hey, what's wrong?!

314
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,910
Th-The nobleman is so...

315
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,160
Nobleman?!

316
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,790
All of the female staff are fainting.

317
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,670
What?!

318
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,770
No, I can't take it anymore!

319
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,670
Look, that's Cavendish!

320
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,680
The Pirate Noble?! Is he alive?!

321
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,950
I can't believe how beautiful he is!

322
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,730
This is the dressing room, huh?

323
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,630
Hey you, right there.

Well, whatever you do,

330
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,040
I will win the Flare-Flare Fruit.

331
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:13,340
Yes! That beautiful power belongs only to me.
