2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,480
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,--

11
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,060
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

12
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,060
They landed on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen.

13
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,560
After forming an alliance with Trafalgar Law,

14
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,140
Luffy finally encountered Caesar Clown

15
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,530
aka the Master who rules the island

16
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,670
but was beaten by his mysterious power.

17
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,750
Meanwhile, Law, too, got taken down by
the Navy G-5 base commander - Vergo.

18
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,750
Why did you take them away?
The children are suffering!

19
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,800
What?!

20
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,970
Special Attack!

21
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,720
Fire Bird Star!

22
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,940
You bastard!

23
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,220
Gastanet!

24
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,700
--Brownbeard!
--What happened?!

25
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,240
Gastanet!

26
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,560
"Shaking Up the New World!
Caesar's Horrendous Experiment!"

27
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,430
IN FRONT OF CAESAR'S LABORATORY

28
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,020
Open up!

29
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,730
Dammit! It's as solid as rock!

30
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,240
Hey! Open the shutter!

31
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,320
Give us back Smo-yan and Tashigi-chan!

32
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,280
Those creepy creatures...

33
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,080
They went that way but...

34
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,500
Forget about them! Focus on saving
Smo-yan and Tashigi-chan now!

35
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,670
Open it, Caesar!

36
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,460
What's that?

37
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,760
An airship?!

38
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,610
Now, get off, children!

39
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,740
This is your home!

40
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,500
Don't ever go out on your own!

41
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,250
Master, thank you!

42
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,840
Sheep-san, give me the candy.

43
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,130
Master! I want the candy now!

44
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,470
My head hurts! Master, give me the candy now!

45
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,020
Of course, you can have it soon.

46
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,830
Everyone, go straight
back to the Biscuit Room.

47
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,030
I've left plenty of candy in there for you.

48
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,610
I have to go back to my research room now.

49
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,050
Relax and enjoy the candies in the room!

50
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,080
They are very, very delicious!

51
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,330
Yeah!

52
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,640
Let's go to the room! Show
me the way, Mr. Sheep!

53
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,840
It's this way, kids.

54
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,220
--The Biscuit Room!
--I want the candy now!

55
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,030
You know what to do, don't you?

56
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,870
Once they're all inside,

57
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,200
lock them up securely and
don't ever let them get out.

58
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,060
Yes, sir.

59
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,010
It's scary here!

60
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,870
Hey!

61
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,840
What's the matter, brat...

62
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,580
I mean, princess?

63
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,590
What's wrong?

64
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,710
Why don't you go back to
the room like everyone else

65
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,820
and have that sweet candy?

66
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,220
Huh? What?!

67
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,690
Don't go! Do you wanna go back to the lab?!

68
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,040
Get out of my way!

69
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,200
Usopp!

70
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,820
Master, give me the candy!

71
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,890
That's it. Come back to me, children.

72
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,620
Wait, you all!

73
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,250
You shouldn't go back to him!

74
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,770
Don't you wanna go home?!

75
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,150
1, 2, 3!

76
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,230
No! I wanna get out!

77
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,630
What are you talking about?

78
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,440
It's cold outside and don't you
realize what floor you're on?

79
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,150
Now, go back to the room.

80
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,360
No! Help me, Sis!

81
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,940
Mocha?

82
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,050
Let's go get the candy already!

83
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,580
Good girl! Go back to the room!

84
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,330
The candy is in that room!

85
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,530
Why are you people so scary?

86
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,510
I'm scared! I'm scared!

87
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,270
Sis and the others were very nice to me!

88
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,560
Is it because I'm not a good child?!

89
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,310
Oh yeah!

90
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,270
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you! Bro! Sis!

91
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,360
Help me!

92
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,480
Hey, get away from the door!

93
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,860
Damn! What a pain in the butt!

94
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,660
Help me! Sis!

95
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,080
Sis!!

96
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,210
THE REMAINS OF THE FIRST
AND SECOND LABORATORY

97
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,810
Ow, ow, ow...

98
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,940
I'm alive!

99
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,850
There are a whole bunch of cuts
and bruises on Sanji-kun's body

100
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,480
but it's so strong!

101
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,210
I'm alive thanks to his body!

102
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,430
Where are the children?!

103
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,030
Usopp!

104
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,490
Stay with me, Usopp!

105
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,140
You came to save me, Sanji?

106
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm Nami!

107
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,470
Hey, don't be so disappointed!

108
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,560
Now, get up!

109
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,820
We have to save the children!

110
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,810
Hey, Usopp!

111
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,540
Do you want milk?

112
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,530
No, just sugar is fine.

113
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,370
You don't have to take care of me.

114
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,670
Anyway,

115
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,290
what's taking Caesar so long?

116
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,750
Just in time.

117
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Sorry to keep you waiting, Vergo!

118
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,820
No problem. I was having coffee and cookies.

119
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,920
That's odd. The cookies are gone.

120
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,940
I didn't serve you any cookies.

121
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,460
Oh yeah, I wasn't having cookies.

122
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,030
When does the experiment start, Caesar?

123
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,090
Soon. Monet, turn the video on.

124
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,850
Right away.

125
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,890
By the way, I wish you had your man

126
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,090
under better control, Vergo!

127
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,480
When I saw Smoker here,
I broke into a cold sweat.

128
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,760
Yeah, well - he was like a wild
dog. He was beyond my control.

129
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,140
But that'll all change after today.

130
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,440
Look at yourself!

131
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,830
Law!

132
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,790
I bet you were quite helpless
against Vergo! Hmm?

133
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,900
The deal I had with you worked in my favor!

134
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,210
In exchange for letting you stay here,

135
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,650
you're going to give my people legs?

136
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,180
That would be nice, of course.

137
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,850
But since you're stronger than me

138
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,630
and I'm the boss of this island,

139
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,770
if you want to stay here, I
need a little bit of insurance.

140
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,470
I wasn't planning on hurting you.

141
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,900
What do you want me to do?

142
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,360
How about this, Trafalgar Law?

143
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,240
I want to entrust my dear
secretary Monet's heart to you!

144
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,540
Is that okay, Monet?

145
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,540
Yes. No problem.

146
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,790
In return,

147
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,300
let me keep your heart!

148
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,520
And that's a deal!

149
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,440
As long as we have each other by the balls,

150
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,100
you can't do anything bad.

151
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,930
And I feel safe.

152
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,110
I knew I shouldn't trust anybody.

153
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,620
It's your own fault!

154
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,440
I bet you learned it the
hard way already but...

155
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,110
...Vergo has your heart.

156
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,540
Hey!

157
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,960
I know it was impossible even for
a man such as yourself to notice

158
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,300
but Monet tactfully transformed
herself and followed you.

159
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,100
Hey, are you alright?! Tra-guy!

160
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,600
I know what you guys are up to.

161
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,560
What a shame, Law.

162
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,580
I thought we became good friends.

163
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,980
You've been saved by your
diligent secretary, huh?

164
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,830
I should've been more careful about Monet.

165
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,950
Seeing as how the "Master" was
so dumb, I didn't care much.

166
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,960
Watch your mouth, young man!

167
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,330
I can't believe it! He took your
heart and you're still alive?!

168
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,690
How stupid can you be, letting him
take advantage of your own ability?!

169
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,640
Where is mine?

170
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,190
It's here!

171
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,230
Smo...

172
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,270
Master.

173
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,820
The video is ready.

174
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,740
Oh yeah?

175
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,640
You're a lucky man!

176
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,710
Alright, put it on.

177
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,090
It's a huge ball!

178
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,640
What is he up to?

179
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,170
Finally!

180
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,510
Something is on the screen!

181
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,580
What is that? Where is it? That looks like...

182
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,230
...a candy! It's a huge candy!

183
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,350
When did they place that
Video Transponder Snail?

184
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:22,460
VARIOUS PLACES IN THE NEW
WORLD UNDERWORLD BROKERS

185
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,760
Thank you for waiting, brokers.

186
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,850
It's going to start soon. The Smilies...

187
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,110
...that made their way

188
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,180
from the Burning Lands separately...

189
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,940
...will all arrive at this

190
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,460
central part of the Ice Lands very soon.

191
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,750
When they merge into one another

192
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,320
and become one big "Smiley" again,

193
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,460
the experiment will begin.

194
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,150
You see - Smiley is...

195
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,220
...the H2S poison gas bomb itself...

196
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,210
...the same one that killed
everything on the island...

197
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,670
...four years ago!

198
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,090
H2S gas?

199
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,060
Last time,

200
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,810
despite the fact they were
growing weaker by the minute,

201
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,080
those afflicted with the gas
were able to take cover.

202
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,400
That was a problem.

203
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,470
So what I'm going to do is give Smiley,

204
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,720
the weapon from four
years ago, a big "boost."

205
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,110
It will add a new effect to the poison gas

206
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,810
and the weapon of mass destruction
will reach completion.

207
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,320
The new weapon that will make
its debut today is called...

208
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,070
...Shinokuni!

209
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,530
THE ICE LANDS - THE CENTRAL PART

210
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,760
They're coming!

211
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,750
Can we even outrun such monsters?!

212
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,680
Oh, it's coming!

213
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,150
It finally coalesced into
one blob on this side!

214
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,730
First of all, what is that?!

215
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,090
What difference does it make now?! Just run!

216
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,820
Hey, guys! I see a ball!

217
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,900
What's that?!

218
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,910
It looks like... a candy?!

219
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,990
Somebody's there underneath it!

220
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,370
VEGAPUNK'S DRAGON - SMALL SIZE

221
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,710
Master, I see a big, gel-like creature.

222
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,820
I think that's Smiley.

223
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,380
Now we are going to project Master's
video on the fog as planned.

224
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,700
Yes.

225
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,000
Then you all have to get out
of there. It's too dangerous.

226
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,410
Hurry up with the dragon sled...

227
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,770
What?

228
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,780
This is...

229
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,240
We have a problem! The sled is melting!

230
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,230
It's useless now!

231
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,330
How did it happen? Is it some
kind of chemical reaction?

232
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,250
We can't use it!

233
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,010
The dragon escaped!

234
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,540
What's going on?! One thing after another!

235
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,460
Wh-What?!

236
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,800
This is terrible!

237
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,720
That's a bit overdramatic.

238
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,650
You all, just run!

239
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,850
The protective suit won't help!

240
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,570
Take it off and run to the lab now!

241
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,540
What? O-Okay!

242
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,150
Take the suit off?!

243
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,860
The Master is always right!

244
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,990
I'm sure he has a plan! Do as he says!

245
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,840
Let's go!

246
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,880
Hope this works right!

247
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,470
Oh?!

248
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,440
Somebody's image is being
projected in the air this time!

249
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,150
Forget about all that crap! Just run!

250
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,110
Smiley! I missed you!

251
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,490
It's been three years!

252
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh yes, Smiley?

253
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,960
This brings back memories!

254
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,470
I have something good for you!

255
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,890
Wait! Wait, Smiley!

256
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,670
You have to wait!

257
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,810
You must obey me! Just as I taught you.

258
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,320
Wait! I said "Wait"!

259
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,640
We have a great deal to talk about!

260
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,260
Do you remember?

261
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,520
That was just...

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,230
...four years ago!

263
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,670
A-All right.

264
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Yeah, all right! You can eat now! Oh yes!

265
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,670
He's not listening to you.

266
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,640
Enough!

267
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,400
It's acting funny.

268
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,170
What is that?

269
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,590
That's a big candy!

270
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,790
Good boy, Smiley.

271
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,740
Nobody can stop him now!

272
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,380
Used in the past to convert Punk
Hazard into a land of death,

273
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,550
Caesar's ultimate poison is unleashed.

274
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,260
It swallows person after person as it spreads...

275
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,680
...and closes in on the Straw Hats as the island is transformed into a hellish landscape.

276
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

277
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,060
"The Deadliest Weapon of Mass
Destruction in History! Shinokuni!"

278
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,830
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
