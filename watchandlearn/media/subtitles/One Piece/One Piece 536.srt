00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,860
Daybreak hasn’t come yet and I can’t wait

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,690

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,660
Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660
Make waves, jump from your sleep

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,880
Being brazen, is it a crime?

shinpai nante dokofuku kaze--

32

It's not our way to worry

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

It’s important not to wake up

39
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,520
Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,690
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

76
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,440
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training.

77
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,990
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

78
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,870
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level.

79
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,830
But they have yet to gather and are
stirring things up as a fragmented crew!

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,960
Luffy set out from the Ryugu Palace
with Mermaid Princess Shirahoshi.

81
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,840
Robin got information about a Poneglyph

82
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,880
that's hidden somewhere
on the Fish-Man Island.

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,970
I think this kingdom holds the
important key to the 100-Year Void!

84
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,390
Franky found the Sunny at the Sea Forest
- the resting place for sunken ships.

85
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,520
I'll do the coating. Count on me, completely!

86
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,070
Oh, thank you... Um... Can I ask your name?

87
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm Den.

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,030
Oh, by the way, somebody has been
sitting there for quite a while.

89
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,330
Oh, that's Boss Jimbei!

90
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,540
He said he's expecting somebody.

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,260
Zoro, Usopp, Nami, and Brook who
have unintentionally taken over

92
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,130
the Ryugu Palace by accident...

93
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,640
...came face to face with
Hordy, Vander Decken

94
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,970
and his rebel forces who are
trying to destroy the kingdom!

95
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,190
My Shirahoshi disappeared?!

96
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,770
She's my... My daughter-jamon!

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,570
We've been in love for a decade!
Nothing will tear us apart...

98
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,280
...except for death!

99
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,370
Before you become somebody else's,

100
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:22,090
I'd rather see you dead with your blood
splattered all over! Shirahoshi!

101
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:31,060
"The Battle in the Ryugu Palace!
Zoro vs. Hordy!"

102
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,030
That's an octopus-san!

103
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,570
That's a blowfish-san!

104
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,110
Oh, there is a killifish-chan as well!

105
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,080
Coward, you only see fish!

106
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,870
Look, a rice ball and a doughnut!

107
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,080
Meat!

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,250
Luffy-sama, you're only seeing food!

109
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,090
Am I?

110
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,260
Jamon! Jamon!

111
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,430
Jamon!

112
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,730
What is it all of the sudden?

113
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,980
F-Father-sama! He must be
worrying about me at the palace now...

114
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,070
Boy, you're such a pain.

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,660
Here, Coward!

116
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,830
Luffy-sama!

117
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,210
Why are you laughing?! Swallow her now!

118
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,270
Vander Decken is going after Shirahoshi!

119
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,360
Neptune-sama!

120
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,650
I beg you-jamon, you people!

121
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,240
I'll give you anything you want!

122
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,450
Let me go after Decken!

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
You can take silver, gold and jewels...

124
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,540
...or my soldiers' lives or anything!

125
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,330
Huh?

126
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,920
No no, King!

127
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:30,010
He's gonna catch Shirahoshi!
My treasure--Shirahoshi!

128
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,550
How pathetic, Neptune.

129
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:41,560
I never thought that the hateful Straw Hats
would help us conquer the Ryugu Palace!

130
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
"Hateful"?

131
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,660
He's got Arlong's mark, too!

132
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,920
Jimbei told me there was something
going on in the Fish-Man District!

133
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I can't believe you, a former proud soldier
of Neptune's army, are the ringleader!

134
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,460
Shame on you, Hordy!

135
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,510
Shame?

136
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,940
I'd feel shame if I had felt any
real pride to be in Neptune's army.

137
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:32,110
The only reason I joined the army was to
learn fighting skills in actual combat.

138
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,280
And that's all.

139
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,120
--You bastard!
--I became stronger thanks to you.

140
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
What do you mean?

141
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,290
You all have failed to notice
what's been going on on the island.

142
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,760
Since I was a child, I've seen Fish-Men
oppressed at the hands of irrational humans.

143
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,630
Help me-dosun!

144
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,020
We've gone through all the trouble
to get to the Fish-Man Island,

145
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,440
why don't we take a Fish-Man back with us?

146
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,810
L-Let me go-dosun!

147
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,150
Give us back our friend! You kidnappers!

148
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,530
Do you Fish-Man brats
wanna mess with us humans?

149
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,540
They're worth far less than Merfolk

150
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,130
but we can make some extra
money by selling them as a set.

151
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,090
I can't take it anymore!

152
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,840
They can't even breathe in the water...

153
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,970
...but no matter how much we kill them,
these damn humans never go away!

154
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,780
I admired Arlong's ambition to
take the arrogance out of them!

155
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,990
We're gonna restore his dream!

156
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,370
We're the New Fish-Man Pirates!

157
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:16,300
I was training myself to become
Arlong's right-hand man one day...

158
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,010
...when he set out to conquer the world
from the East Blue as he planned.

159
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,430
But...

160
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,060
...unfortunately he was
stopped by some humans.

161
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,280
So these Fish-Men are followers of Arlong?!

162
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,410
What?! Arlong?!

163
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,250
Just kidding! I've never had Arlong before...

164
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,210
Ouch! Hey, Usopp-san, why did you kick me?!

165
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,010
Just shut up for now!

166
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,930
Enough with chit-chatting
and let's get down to business.

167
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,020
Stay away!

168
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,560
Wh-What the...

169
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,150
Shark Grip!

170
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,950
What a strong grip! What
the hell is he doing?!

171
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,460
--No! I tell you this is no good!
--What should we do?!

172
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,170
Nami-chin?

173
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,260
Camie, do me a favor!

174
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,630
What?

175
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,560
Is that his own strength?

176
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,770
Yeah, he hasn't taken an Energy Steroid yet.

177
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,230
The walls are broken!

178
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,990
Oh damn! It's a flood!

179
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,130
--Oh this is no good! Especially for me!
--I'm gonna drown!

180
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,390
--No, water drops!
--Get down! He's gonna do it!

181
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,570
Shark Arrows!

182
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,110
Those water drops are becoming arrows!

183
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,840
You bastard! How dare you
shoot my soldiers at random!

184
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,510
Stop it!

185
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,970
You fool!

186
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,890
--King-sama!
--Don't do that!

187
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,520
No-jamon! You guys are my subjects-jamon!

188
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,150
Neptune-sama!

189
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,440
What an idiot! What kind of a king
becomes a shield for his men?!

190
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,690
You don't have what it takes to be king!

191
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,820
--King-sama!
--Damn Hordy!

192
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,780
It's awful! He's shooting at the unarmed!

193
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,290
And he's way stronger than Arlong!

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,630
One-Sword Style!

195
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,960
Bird Dance!

196
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,300
Hey wait, Boss Hordy! It's...

197
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,890
That bastard! He shielded
himself with his own man!

198
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,010
Hey guys, untie the soldiers!

199
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:34,510
What?

200
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,940
The negotiation with the
kingdom has broken down.

201
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,730
We couldn't keep our word to give
them back all the hostages unharmed.

202
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,610
He's so trustworthy.

203
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,400
Alright, I got it!

204
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,370
Oh, my foot is in the water!
I'm losing my strength!

205
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,370
Help me, Nami-san!

206
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,410
Oh? Where is Nami-san?

207
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,410
Huh? Nami is gone?

208
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,880
Where did she go? Camie is missing too!

209
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,090
Boy! First Luffy and now Nami?
But we have to untie them first!

210
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,600
Hang on for a minute, Brook!

211
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,020
He's driving my bones too hard...
Why don't you run now?

212
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,690
Please untie the others.
I have no energy left...

213
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,610
Untie the others and take up your arms!

214
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,610
Don't let them do a damn thing!

215
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,120
Destroy all of Neptune's
army and the Straw Hats!

216
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,620
Special Attack--Green Star "Rafflesia"!

217
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,670
--Whoa! A flower from earth opened up!
--I've never seen such a flower!

218
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,840
Take it!

219
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,760
Oh, it stinks!

220
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,680
Damn! How stupid!

221
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,520
--How's that?!
--I can't take it anymore...

222
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Zoro! The water is rising!

223
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,780
I have a favor to ask!
Let those two get out of here!

224
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,950
What about you?

225
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,490
No one can get away with
that guy chasing after them!

226
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,750
Don't stand in my way of
conquering this country!

227
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,310
Okay! Nothing has been broken.

228
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,020
Sorry that I pushed you
so hard all of the sudden.

229
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,350
You can rest here for a while.

230
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,770
Do you want me to help you with the coating?

231
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,990
No, every man knows his own trade best.

232
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,860
Okay, thank you!

233
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,240
Oh, there you are, Sunny!

234
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,540
--Robin!
--Is she your friend?

235
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah. Did you finish your business?

236
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,710
Not yet. I really need to
check something. There it is.

237
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,420
Hey hey, outsiders should stay out of there!

238
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,380
Thank you for your suggestion.

239
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,800
She's odd, isn't she?

240
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,850
Look who's talking.

241
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,990
You were the only one who
could see my arrows earlier.

242
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,450
Is it because you've seen Arlong's?

243
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,370
If you've learned how to see them for
the second time, that's impressive.

244
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:57,300
But no matter how skillful you are,
no one can beat a Fish-Man in the sea!

245
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,610
You can't deflect them in the water!

246
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,580
Three-Sword Style! Dragon Twister!

247
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,040
Oh, seems like I can have some fun.

248
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,680
I don't have much time!

249
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,760
CORAL HILL--AT THE SHORE

250
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,770
Stay with me! It's gonna be okay!

251
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,650
Hurry up and get out of here!

252
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,360
Don't worry about us now!
Just think about yourself...

253
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,860
What do you guys want?

254
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,610
We want the Mermaids back!

255
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,820
You humans only see us as novelties!

256
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,740
Ah? What are you talking about?!

257
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,830
Don't play dumb, you pirates!

258
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,540
We heard that 3 more young Mermaids
disappeared at a beach in the south.

259
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,790
Where are those girls?

260
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,090
I don't know what you're talking about!

261
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,050
Why do you think that we
did it? It's true that...

262
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,560
...I love Mermaid-chans so much
that I wanna take them away!

263
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,560
But we didn't kidnap them.

264
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,480
See? You just said that
you wanna take them away!

265
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,110
Why are you guys arguing? Be quiet!

266
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,280
I knew humans did it!

267
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,700
Get out!

268
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,610
Ouch!

269
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,540
There's some left in it! Don't waste food!

270
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,290
Shut up, human!

271
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,080
Oh? Sanji! Chopper!

272
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,590
Hey, Sanji! Is your nosebleed stopped now?

273
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,260
Is that Luffy?! What's that blowfish?

274
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,760
A human gentleman and...

275
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,060
...a racoon! It looks exactly
the same as in the book!

276
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,390
A-Are they your friends, Luffy-sama?

277
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,150
They are my crewmembers!

278
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,230
They are?

279
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,190
Look! That's their captain!

280
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,030
That straw hat... He's the boss
of the Mermaid kidnappers!

281
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,040
I don't want them to see me! Megalo,
close your mouth a little more!

282
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,550
I'm gonna go down there for a bit!

283
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,510
What?

284
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,050
He came down!

285
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,060
Hachi! I thought that was you!

286
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,020
Straw Hat...

287
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,310
What happened to you?! Who did this?!

288
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,940
He's not saying!

289
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,440
Get off of this island!

290
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,990
That's all he's been saying!

291
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,830
But if I'm correct, the pirate--Straw Hat
is occupying the Ryugu Palace now!

292
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,750
They're kidnapping Mermaids! He came to
kidnap more leaving his men at the palace!

293
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,710
Maybe he's gonna kidnap
Princess Shirahoshi in the end!

294
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,510
Don't be ridiculous! That's impossible!

295
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,050
The Princess is a giant
smelt-whiting Mermaid

296
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,180
and the God of the Sea--
Neptune's beloved daughter!

297
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,640
Some people might dream about kidnapping
her, but no one could do it for real.

298
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,400
What is that blowfish?

299
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,650
No!

300
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,190
What?!

301
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,610
--Oh!
--Huh?!

302
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,410
Princess Shirahoshi-sama?!

303
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,960
Um... Well, uh...

304
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,750
You found me!

305
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,840
She's big! Don't tell me that that is...

306
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,300
...the Mermaid Princess?

307
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,220
What? Is there anybody behind me?

308
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,270
No, Sanji! Don't turn around at any cost!

309
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,400
Huh? What's going on?

310
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,980
If you do, you're gonna die, Sanji!

311
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,940
Oh, no.

312
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,250
They kidnapped the Mermaid Princess!

313
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,750
Angered by the kidnapping
of Princess Shirahoshi,

314
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,030
the terrifying Hammond of
Fish-Man Island captures Luffy.

315
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,050
And then, Vander Decken
finally reveals himself!

316
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,430
Can Luffy escape his bonds and safely
take Shirahoshi to the Sea Forest?

317
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,890
And, upon seeing an attractive mermaid,
