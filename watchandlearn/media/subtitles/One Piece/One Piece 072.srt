00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,540
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,710
"Luffy Gets Angry!
A Dirty Trick Violates The Sacred Duel!"

22
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,370
H-He blocked the blow with his helmet!

23
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,700
If he was off by even an inch,
he would've died instantly!

24
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,660
What a fight...

25
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,330
Each of their attacks is a mortal blow
aimed at the opponent's vital point!

26
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,730
Those two have continued this
duel to the death for 100 years?

27
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,370
But this is good... We can use this
opportunity to get out of here.

28
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,350
Usopp?

29
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,020
Incredible...

30
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,020
Reason?

31
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,690
I don't remember.

32
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,370
Even without a reason,
they're fighting so seriously...

33
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,810
This fight sure is a bother.

34
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,340
You idiot!

35
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,980
This is what people mean
by a real battle between men!

36
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,650
What's that about?

37
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:38,990
To use an analogy, those two fly
a warrior's flag in their heart.

38
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,330
This flag is even more
important than their life.

39
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,730
In no way do they want it
to be destroyed by others.

40
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,600
That's why they've continued to take
on each other for 100 long years!

41
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,340
Do you get it? This is unmistakably

42
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,040
a "proud duel" between "warriors"!

43
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,820
Whatever... Stuff like that
doesn't interest me.

44
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,350
Now, hurry up!

45
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,520
I'm gonna watch this a little longer.

46
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,430
This is exactly what my goal is...
To be a "brave warrior of the sea"!

47
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,430
I wanna be a proud man like them!

48
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,310
I see... So you wanna be a giant.

49
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,310
No!! Were you even listening to me?!

50
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,750
There! Don't you have
to watch them over there?

51
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,360
If there's a village with
warriors like them in it,

52
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,930
I wanna go there someday.

53
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,000
I've got a good view from here.

54
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,140
They'll find you, Miss Valentine.
Come down already!

55
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,340
Don't worry, Mr. 5... After all,
they're absorbed in the fight.

56
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,680
They won't notice.

57
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Just come down!

58
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,180
Okay, okay.

59
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,520
Hey, do you really get it?

60
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,960
This is a big job for 200 million Berries.

61
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,630
Of course...

62
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,800
Although I feel reluctant
to do as Mr. 3 tells us...

63
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,200
I know... Let's go.

64
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,340
Okay.

65
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,390
We're both getting homesick,
aren't we, Dorry?

66
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,600
That's why I'll beat you
and go back to Elbaf, Broggy.

67
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,950
73,466 duels...

68
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,760
73,466 draws...

69
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,940
Dorry! Actually,
I got alcohol from my guests.

70
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,880
Great! It's been a while since
I had a drink. Give me some.

71
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,290
What was that?

72
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,630
First a long, strange earthquake,
and now this? What is it this time?

73
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,970
Are there weird creatures other
than dinosaurs in this jungle?

74
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,700
Well, that damn cook is
probably the only one

75
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,640
who'd be happy to
capture things like that...

76
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Were those bird cries?

77
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,310
Even so, those were vulgar,
unappetizing cries.

78
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,980
Although we're competing to capture a
big prey, we're still looking for food.

79
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,490
Not only does it have to be big,
it also has to be tasty.

80
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,660
That guy doesn't get it at all.

81
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,940
I see. His guests are your friends, huh?

82
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,170
I saw a man with a long nose and a woman.

83
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,610
That's Usopp and Nami!

84
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,540
Hah! They said they
wouldn't get off the ship,

85
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,610
but they really do like
adventures after all!

86
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,480
Then you could also say that
I got this alcohol from you.

87
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,690
By the way, Dorry-san,

88
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,290
does it really take a year
for the Log to be stored?

89
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:51,300
Didn't you notice the
human skulls lying around?

90
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,640
Those who come to this island die
before the Log is stored in most cases.

91
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,310
Some become dinosaurs' food.
Some suffer from the heat and starvation.

92
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,650
Some others are killed because
they attack us. They all die...

93
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:13,990
It seems that one year on this
island is too long for humans.

94
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,330
What're we gonna do?
Even if we could survive for a year,

95
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,670
if that much time passes, I don't know
what will happen to my country by then.

96
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,670
Yeah. I'd get bored, too,
if we stay here for a year.

97
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,010
Isn't there a good way, old guy?

98
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,370
Hmmm...

99
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,010
We do have an Eternal Pose,
but it's to our hometown, Elbaf.

100
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,350
In other words, we're fighting
for this Eternal Pose.

101
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,920
Do you wanna try taking it by force?

102
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,020
That's no good.
That's not where we wanna go.

103
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,360
We just wanna go to the island
after this one. Right?

104
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,160
Yes...

105
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,700
If we lose the route to Alabasta,
there's no point in moving forward.

106
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,370
See?

107
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,310
Then why don't you
move forward randomly?

108
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,380
If you're lucky, you'll get there.

109
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,320
Maybe we'll do that!

110
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,130
We may actually get there, huh?

111
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,330
Come to think of it, there was someone
who left before the Log was stored.

112
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,670
What happened to him?

113
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,340
How should I know?

114
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,010
He must've gotten to the next island.

115
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,670
That must be it!

116
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,350
What's so funny?

117
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,020
I can't understand what they're thinking!

118
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,420
A brave warrior of the sea? What's that?

119
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,250
I'm talking about you guys.
I wanna be like you guys someday!

120
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,990
Hm? You mean a giant?

121
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,330
--See?
--That's not it!

122
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,670
I hope to live proudly
just like the warriors of Elbaf!

123
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,400
I see!

124
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,340
Especially since our life span
is longer than you humans',

125
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,010
we think about how we die.

126
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,680
Your assets, life...
Everything will eventually cease to exist.

127
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,020
But if we could die as a warrior of
Elbaf without destroying our pride,

128
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,690
that would be "dying with honor."

129
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:08,030
That pride is an everlasting treasure
that is passed on in the land of Elbaf.

130
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,030
So pride is your treasure...
That's so cool...

131
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,970
I've just decided... that I'll
call you Master from now on!

132
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,210
Huh?

133
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,590
Giant old guy!

134
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,660
What's going on?!

135
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,000
Why did the alcohol explode?!

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,570
That was the alcohol
we had on our ship, right?!

137
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,440
It exploded in his stomach!
His opponent must've laid the explosive!

138
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,680
What the hell were you watching?!

139
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,350
They've been fighting for 100 years!
No way they'd do something like this!

140
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,520
Then who on earth...

141
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,620
You bastards did...

142
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,700
It wasn't Broggy.

143
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,970
We're proud warriors of Elbaf.

144
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,870
Who else besides you
should I be suspicious of?

145
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,310
Let's get out of here for now! It's
probably no use saying anything to him!

146
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,910
It's probably no use even if we run.

147
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,650
Hold this and stay back.

148
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,020
Don't tell me! Are you going to fight?

149
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,060
I feel bad to do this to the old guy,
but I'll quiet him down.

150
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,330
Both of you, stop! Please!

151
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,670
Dorry-san, please listen!
We really don't know anything about it!

152
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,010
Anything about the alcohol that exploded!
So please don't fight!

153
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,280
You have to stay calm!
Your insides are in bad shape right now!

154
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,020
How dare you...
do something so insolent?!

155
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,760
Gum-Gum!

156
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,420
Gum-Gum!

157
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,330
I'm sorry.

158
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,900
Rocket!!

159
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,700
Luffy-san!!

160
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,310
So he has... the powers of a Devil Fruit...

161
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,610
I underestimated... him...

162
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,970
Luffy-san! Are you all right?

163
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
How's the old guy?

164
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,670
He's probably okay.

165
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,840
This is actually good.
Otherwise he wouldn't have calmed down.

166
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,610
I'm angry!

167
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,010
What?

168
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,290
Like the old guy said, this alcohol
explosion isn't the act of the other giant,

169
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,620
and my friends would never
do a stupid thing like this!

170
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,960
Then who on earth...

171
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,030
There's someone else...
on this island...

172
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,580
Games are heavily influenced
by people's state of mind.

173
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,980
They are confused right now...

174
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,990
...by the cryptic bomb service
from an invisible enemy...

175
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,320
First, about our first target,
Dorry the Blue Ogre...

176
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,990
I knew it was impossible to finish him,

177
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,930
but the damage he received in his
stomach still must've been quite large.

178
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:14,940
Now we can drink some tea and
wait for the next duel to start...

179
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,280
So we'll let the other giant take
care of the injured giant, huh?

180
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
That's right.

181
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,610
That's quite a roundabout
way of doing things.

182
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,290
The Warrior species is the
same as wild boars, after all.

183
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,620
We don't have to fight seriously when
they're only good at going head-on

184
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,030
since even if we can't win power-wise,

185
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,300
we have brains that can make up for it.

186
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:05,320
Geez... Get it yourself, Miss Golden Week.

187
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,660
By the way, what're we going
to do with the Straw Hat gang?

188
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,930
Straw Hat? Oh yeah, the small fries
that found out the Boss's secret...

189
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,600
Well, we can just lure them out one by
one starting with whoever's convenient

190
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,540
to my "service set"...

191
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,110
My motto is "big crimes via cheap tricks."

192
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,620
There're many ways to defeat
enemies without actually fighting.

193
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Mr. 3, refill please.

194
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,220
Hey, me too.

195
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,420
You guys! Take time to savor it!

196
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,630
Ah!

197
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,760
That mountain is...
if I'm not mistaken...

198
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,810
This isn't good.
I'm running out of time...

199
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,310
Ah... Sorry.

200
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,990
Ahh! Let it go! I said sorry! Hey!

201
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,320
I don't have time to
mess around! Let it go!

202
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,790
The time-out signal has rung.

203
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,760
Having no prey isn't even funny... Damn...

204
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,670
There's the signal...

205
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,340
It's quite active today.

206
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,350
You're going?! Your wounds from
that last battle still haven't...

207
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,180
It's nothing!
We're both in the same condition!

208
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,130
Making excuses during a merciless
fight to the death would spoil my name!

209
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,710
Hey! Wait, old guy!

210
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,710
Don't go!

211
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,040
You can't go, Dorry-san!
You need to keep still!

212
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,550
You'll die if you push yourself too hard!

213
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,980
I, Warrior Dorry, am here...

214
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,990
At the very least...

215
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,790
...I will fight to uphold the name of Elbaf!

216
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

217
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

218
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

219
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

220
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,170
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

221
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

222
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

223
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

224
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

225
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

226
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

227
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

228
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,980
Damn. I'm lost.

229
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,320
Nami has disappeared!
What am I gonna do?!

230
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,990
Huh, Luffy?

231
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,650
A duel that's been interfered
with isn't a duel anymore!

232
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,160
Who is it?! Who's doing this?!
Show yourself!

233
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,330
Hey, who are they?

234
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,330
Baroque Works!

235
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,330
So you're the ones...

236
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,330
How dare you violate the proud battle?!
You won't get away with it!

237
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

238
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,670
"Broggy's Bitter Tears Of Victory!
The Conclusion Of Elbaf"

239
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
