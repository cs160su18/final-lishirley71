Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,740
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,620
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,380
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,650
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

75
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,680
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,250
Now, the detail of the

77
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,000
nightmare that Dressrosa faced
10 years ago is revealed.

78
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,320
I am the rightful king of this country!
And now, I'm...

79
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,810
...back!

80
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,780
I'm going to sell you this country
for 10 billion berries.

81
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,950
Please let me borrow all of your money!

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,990
Stop! Don't make me do this!

83
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,500
--King Riku-sama, please stop!
--What are you doing?!

84
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,100
Boy... What kind of king he is!

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,460
Well, the night has just begun, soldiers.

86
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,520
You should dance, too!

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,780
Parasite String!

88
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,960
Wh-What the hell? What's going on?!

89
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,360
M-My arm is moving on its own!

90
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,010
Why does it move on its own?!

91
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,010
Is it what's happening to King-sama?!

92
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,280
There's no way to justify myself!

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,270
This country is finished!

94
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,510
Doflamingo set us up!

95
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,810
Hey, hey!
Can we do it already, Doffy?

96
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,970
Idiot. Don't rush.

97
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,720
I have to make the people tremble
with fear more

98
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,060
and get them hate King Riku
with all their heart!

99
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,910
And then, the heroes will appear!

100
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,780
"A Nightmare!
The Tragic Night of Dressrosa!"

101
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,040
--What happened to King-sama?!
--The whole country is in chaos!

102
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,960
He didn't look right
when he left the palace earlier

103
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,240
but I didn't expect this!

104
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,200
It's more than we can handle within
the country so I called the Navy!

105
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,170
Captain Vergo said
he's gonna take care of it!

106
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,430
Oh, that's good!

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,340
Father-sama!

108
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,500
Father-sama...

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,140
Why?

110
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,660
Why are you doing that?!

111
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,000
Snow?

112
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,730
Monet! What are you doing there?!

113
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,890
You're a maid!

114
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,050
Why are you opening the gate of the palace?!

115
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,450
Princess Viola.

116
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,490
If you use your Clairvoyance,
you can see clearly...

117
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,050
...what is happening in this country!

118
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,040
I'm waiting to welcome
the new royal family.

119
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,930
Wh-What are you...

120
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,550
Now, shall we?

121
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,440
Viola-sama.

122
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,430
--The east tower has been bombed!
--Some pirates have breached the palace!

123
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,540
They took Viola-sama!

124
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,690
The palace is not too bad.
It's kind of nice.

125
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,770
Yeah, I love it-dasuyan!

126
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,060
It's perfect for Young Master-sama-in!

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,260
--Stop, you fools!
--Are you Doflamingo's clan?

128
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,620
Monet! Let go of Viola-sama!

129
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,270
Did you guys do something to King Riku-sama?!

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,940
Now, we have a lot to do!

131
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,110
We have to "clean up" the whole palace!

132
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,320
Father-sama!

133
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,570
Why are you doing such a thing?!
King Riku Army!

134
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,240
Please stop!

135
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,270
Please stop!

136
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,490
If there's no preventing me
hurting the citizens...

137
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,520
I'd rather be dead!

138
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,450
Somebody, please...

139
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,940
...kill me!

140
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,450
Why is it, King Riku-sama?

141
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,940
Did we do something wrong?

142
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,560
You were always just.

143
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,450
You were...

144
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,200
...the king we were proud of.

145
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,670
You told us that you needed our money.

146
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,770
So we've brought you all our money.

147
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,600
Because you've...

148
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,200
...always cared about us
more than anything!

149
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,830
Because you were our pride and joy!!

150
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,040
King Riku has...

151
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,940
King Riku has trampled
on our feelings!

152
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,210
He's gonna take our money
and kill us all!

153
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,410
To satisfy his own selfish desires,

154
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,880
he's gonna toss us aside like trash!

155
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,160
King Riku, you bastard!

156
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,780
I hate you!

157
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,000
You're...

158
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,450
You're a low-down, dirty scumbag!

159
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,940
The King Riku Army's coming!

160
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,510
Hey, move out of there! Get away!

161
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,980
H-H-Help...

162
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,040
Who are you people?

163
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,710
We're here to save this country!

164
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,060
My name is Don Quixote Doflamingo!

165
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,760
Th-They're pirates!

166
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,650
Pirates?

167
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,140
What is going on?
Why are the pirates...

168
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,400
But they're gonna save us
from the King Riku Army.

169
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,630
King Riku's here!

170
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,510
Here comes a hero!

171
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,490
I like how you "dance"!
King Riku!

172
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,360
Trebol! Pica! Diamante!

173
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,070
Now, go and sweep out the trash
from the whole country!

174
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,790
Yes...

175
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,880
Yes!

176
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,240
We did it!

177
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,630
We survived!

178
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,130
Doflamingo! Doflamingo!

179
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,100
Doflamingo! Doflamingo! Doflamingo!

180
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,240
Follow your doom! Embrace violence!

181
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,770
Stop running! Fight!

182
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,520
You coward!

183
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,130
I'll never forgive your evil family!

184
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,010
--Go to hell already, Rebecca!
--Chop her up!

185
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,740
--You're a piece of shit!
--Drop dead!

186
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,290
The country fell into hands of Doflamingo

187
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,830
in just one night.

188
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,280
How awful!
It's like a nightmare!

189
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,110
How cunning of him!

190
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,190
I-I-I can't stand that Doflamingo guy!

191
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,770
We believed that King Riku
went crazy at that time, too,

192
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,430
so we got in touch with
the new king Doflamingo

193
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,030
and ended up like this.

194
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,810
I'm so ashamed of myself
for distrusting King Riku!

195
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,270
I see! It's really too bad!

196
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,920
You let the innocent king that

197
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,930
you all admired so much die for nothing.

198
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,630
No, he's still alive!

199
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,600
What?!

200
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,150
Doflamingo loved the special ability
the former princess Viola-sama had.

201
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,520
So she bargained with him!

202
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,810
If you promise me that
you won't kill my father,

203
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,000
I will obey you!

204
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,800
She still lives and works
under Doflamingo!

205
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,720
Becoming an officer in his group

206
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,880
and changing her name to Violet!

207
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,010
S-S-She's an officer?!

208
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,480
Then, King Riku is still
alive thanks to her?!

209
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,430
Yes, I'm sure he's still living somewhere
in this country.

210
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,490
But I can't imagine how much pain

211
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,520
he must've gone through over the last decade!

212
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,030
And how hard it must've been for Viola-sama!

213
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,580
Fear, anger, tears!

214
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,750
I wonder how she has spent
the last decade.

215
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,110
And, on the same night,

216
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,240
other soldiers were
manipulated as the king was

217
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,950
and massacred the civilians unwillingly,
they must've been suffering so much, too!

218
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,990
I thought all of them must've
been killed that night!

219
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,570
Some got killed

220
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,070
but others surrendered to Doflamingo

221
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,500
and they're working for him as his guards.

222
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,630
They sold out to him?!

223
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,040
I believe they made an agonizing choice!

224
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,740
Screw you!

225
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,110
They just followed the crazy king's order.

226
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,620
Forgive me for welcoming them
to work under me.

227
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,050
If so, I can't help crying!
Everybody has been suffering so much!

228
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,670
It's a tragedy! You poor people!

229
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,190
There were soldiers who got killed
and who surrendered.

230
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,490
But when you sum it up,

231
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,100
it doesn't add up to a
whole army for a country!

232
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,670
What do you mean by that?

233
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,830
I believe I have lost some memories!

234
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,200
That's what I meant!

235
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,250
Lost some memories?!

236
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,630
Fra-land.

237
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,150
Remember what I've told you earlier?

238
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,310
Even after we became toys,

239
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,050
we remember everything
about when we were humans.

240
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:47,330
But people around us, even our own family,
forgot that we even existed.

241
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,270
What?!

242
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,150
They don't even know
that they lost their loved ones.

243
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,800
That's the biggest tragedy of Dressrosa

244
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,740
and even we toys forgot some things, too.

245
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,750
You mean, there might be your
friends among those toys

246
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,820
that are walking on the streets

247
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,800
but you can't recognize them
because you forgot about them?

248
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,320
Exactly.

249
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,490
In addition, they must've been feeling

250
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,490
angry since Doflamingo turned them into toys.

251
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,900
Damn it all!
Why should I be a toy?!

252
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,670
Get away from my wife!
Damn! I can't say what I wanna say!

253
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,870
--Damn Doflamingo!
--I hate him so much!

254
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,010
Isn't there anybody
who can take him down?!

255
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,880
Doflamingo tried to bury all the dissidents

256
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,100
but that means...

257
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,280
...there are countless dissidents
dwelling in the shadows of this country!

258
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:47,480
That unknown number of those poor people
is the key to our plan!

259
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,020
I see!

260
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,160
That's why you think
there is a chance to win.

261
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,920
It's true that it seems foolhardy

262
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,070
to fight the Warlord's group but...

263
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,940
...if all the toys in this country are dissidents,
it'd be a powerful enough force!

264
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,730
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute!

265
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,340
You seem like you're going for
taking down Doflamingo!

266
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,050
We're only here to destroy the factory!

267
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,480
When it's done, we'll say
goodbye to the country!

268
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,680
Right, Robin?!

269
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,310
I'm so mad at Doflamingo!

270
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,410
You see?

271
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,540
What?!

272
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,980
We're destined to fight
this decisive battle today!

273
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,150
With the event of this morning,
they're challenging us!

274
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,290
It's not a coincidence
that Usoland came to us today!

275
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,810
Somebody from above is telling us
to fight!

276
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,430
--Yeah!
--What event?

277
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,060
Doflamingo's abdication
from the throne.

278
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,450
Oh, the fact is we...

279
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,870
Can you imagine how happy we were
when we heard about it?!

280
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,890
I thought it was a miracle!

281
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,400
And then, we heard it was a false report.

282
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,160
We felt like we were dropped
from heaven to the edge of hell!

283
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,600
So it was only natural for us to...

284
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,930
...decide to fight him today!

285
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,990
We're so sorry for what we did!

286
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,950
You're retired but you led your crew here?

287
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,910
We have no disciples
to succeed the Happo Navy.

288
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,590
I wish I had a grandson.

289
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,230
I see. It's not so easy to be a pirate, eh?

290
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,160
Maybe it's just my imagination
but I feel like I'm forgetting something.

291
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,970
I felt the same way 10 years ago.

292
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,590
Hey, hey, hey, hey, where am I going?!

293
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,740
Grandpa, help me!

294
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,210
What have they done to me -
Abdullah, the lone wolf?!

295
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,120
What have they done to me -
Jeet, the maverick warrior!

296
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,800
Help!

297
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,190
Zoro!

298
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,310
Damn Crest Head!

299
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,300
He said he was gonna show me
the way but he's collapsed!

300
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,330
Is Zoro really here?!

301
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,140
Hey!

302
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,160
Zoro! Kin'emon!
