00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,740
Sickle-Sickle...

22
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,640
...Whirlwind!

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,930
Oww!

24
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,070
A wind slash!

25
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,030
Here they come! Here they come!

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,280
Now!

27
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,370
I won't let you escape...

28
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,810
Yahoo!

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,550
Okay! Set sail for Lost Island!

30
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,540
"A Solitary Island in the Distant Sea!
The Legendary Lost Island"

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,530
Contacting all squad captains!

32
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,670
Assemble on the deck of Ship #1!

33
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,450
Where's the resource manager?!

34
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,880
Turn the yard this way!

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,590
No, no! To the right!

36
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,170
Go get repair planks
from the other ships!

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,010
Repair Team!
Get to work repairing Ship #1!

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,160
Those damn pirates...

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,920
They're quicker at running
than I expected.

40
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,920
No worries. It'd be best to
let them go for now, anyway.

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,440
What do you mean?

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,450
They went to such dangerous lengths
to escape from this island.

43
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,030
Why do you think that is?

44
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,570
Have you forgotten
this island has a legend?

45
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,890
The story about the dragons'
nest on Lost Island...

46
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,700
What? Are you saying they...?!

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,960
It's only a guess.

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,780
But if so, they'll wind up
being the perfect guides there.

49
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,720
Reporting to Commodore Nelson?

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,500
Yes...

51
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,460
There will be no need for that.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,240
Sir! But...!

53
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,340
The Dragonite I seek...
The elixir of immortality...

54
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,730
As if I'd ever hand it over
to the likes of Nelson Royal!

55
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,340
I will have it!

56
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,820
To become a flawless
Eric the Whirlwind!

57
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,580
What's taking so long?!

58
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,220
Commodore, sir! Please have this!

59
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,260
That's not what I mean!

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,740
Commodore Nelson Royal!

61
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,590
Oh! It's about time!

62
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,060
You have a report from Eric, I assume?

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,440
No. It's a message from a soldier
working at Warship Island.

64
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,690
"Eric has located the
legendary Millennial Dragon."

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,270
He goes on to say that all ships
are presently busy repairing damage

66
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,820
that the flagship received.

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,920
Curse you, Eric...

68
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,030
Why've you not reported to me
after finding the Millennial Dragon?!

69
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you planning to take the
Dragonite all for yourself?!

70
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,050
You're nothing more than a hired soldier.

71
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,900
Our main forces will now
head for Warship Island!

72
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,630
All ships, move out!

73
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,320
Lost Island, huh?

74
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,120
The map doesn't have any islands
in the waters around Warship Island

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,240
that fit the bill...

76
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,090
Hey! Grandpa Ryu!

77
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,040
Which way should we go?!

78
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,320
Hey.

79
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,700
I think he went to sleep again!

80
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,310
Sorry for the wait, everyone!

81
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,370
The food's ready!

82
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,200
Did she cook again?!

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,030
No one was waiting for her food!

84
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,960
Oh! Sanji!

85
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,090
Whew, what a relief!

86
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,750
So you made today's meal--?!

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,500
Grandpa Ryu!

88
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,470
Eat lots, okay?

89
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,720
Oh! Food!

90
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,730
Food!

91
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,770
Hot!

92
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,650
Why, you...!

93
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,230
Hot!

94
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,410
Grandpa Ryu!

95
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,320
Apis!

96
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,730
Grandpa Ryu!

97
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,840
Grandpa Ryu!

98
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,880
Are you okay?

99
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,740
Sheesh. I made all that food
and it goes to waste!

100
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,540
Can't you just make some more, then?

101
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,200
The point is we shouldn't waste food!

102
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,880
What is it?

103
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,250
Lost Island...

104
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,620
The dragons' nest...
It's east of Warship Island...

105
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,860
So that's where Lost Island is?!

106
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,870
Grandpa Ryu said he just remembered!

107
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,260
We know where!

108
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,670
Lost Island is east of Warship Island!

109
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,040
Grandpa Ryu said so!

110
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,280
That's right!

111
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,940
Usopp! Take the wheel!

112
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,350
You got it!

113
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,530
Alright! Let's rush
straight for Lost Island!

114
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,570
Dammit! You better eat all of that!

115
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,070
Yep! Leave it to me!

116
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,880
They've changed course?

117
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
Yes, sir! The pirate ship appears
to be headed for the waters

118
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,180
east of Warship Island!

119
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,760
So they're making their move...

120
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,100
Turn the bows eastward!
Full speed ahead!

121
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,850
We're now going to close
in on the Straw Hat Pirates!

122
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,730
Cannoneers to the gun batteries!

123
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,130
All ships, prepare for Level 3 combat!

124
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,270
Our destination...

125
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,340
...is Lost Island.

126
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,930
All ships, move out!

127
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,120
Here, Zoro.

128
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,930
Yeah.

129
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,310
Here you go, Zoro.

130
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,120
Yeah.

131
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,580
Here, Zoro.

132
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,370
Yeah.

133
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,280
Zoro.

134
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,170
Yeah.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,850
Here, Zoro.

136
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,100
Can't you hand 'em
to me without talking?

137
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,670
Lost Island is at the
end of this great ocean!

138
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,690
What kind of island could it be?!

139
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,950
Hey!

140
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
Usopp! See anything?!

141
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,910
Nope, nothing!

142
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,080
No?

143
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,940
Man, we've come a long way, but
there's no sign of an island at all...

144
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,960
Are we sure about this?

145
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,220
Yeah...

146
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,760
And then there's Grandpa Ryu...

147
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,920
I wish he'd remember
some more details or something...

148
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,730
Oh! I know!

149
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,670
Let's bonk Grandpa Ryu
in the head with this!

150
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,350
Think maybe then the shock'll
help him remember something else?

151
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,890
Knock it off!

152
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,330
Hey! Grandpa Ryu! We're almost there!

153
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,910
We're almost to Lost Island!

154
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,640
And it's there, right? The dragons' nest?

155
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
And if you go to the dragons' nest,
you'll get better, right?!

156
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,480
What?

157
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,970
You're so goofy, thanking me!

158
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,560
We're not even there yet!

159
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,580
They followed us, huh?

160
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,120
What's that? Smoke?

161
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,790
Oh, well! We'll see when we get closer!

162
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,670
Urgh!

163
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,030
That's not true! I don't think
you're troubling me at all!

164
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,300
What's your problem?!

165
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,310
--It turned into an argument at some point.
--Hey! Grandpa Ryu!

166
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:45,850
--It turned into an argument at some point.
--Hey! Are you listening?

167
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,620
--It looks more like Apis is
--Hey! Are you listening?

168
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,350
--It looks more like Apis is
--Pretending to sleep isn't fair!

169
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,850
--the only one who's angry, though...
--Pretending to sleep isn't fair!

170
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,520
--the only one who's angry, though...
--Hey, say something!

171
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,350
--Do you think we should stop her?
--Hey, say something!

172
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,190
A... ship?

173
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,170
But something's definitely
not right about it...

174
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,810
Awesome! Nami! Check it out!

175
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,900
I already am...

176
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,820
Look! Look at me!

177
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,250
--The pirate ship!
--This can't be real!

178
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,490
What the--?!

179
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,320
I-It vanished!

180
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,500
What's going on?!

181
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,560
Hey! What just happened?!
Why did they disappear?!

182
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,500
I-I have no idea!

183
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
--All ships, full stop!
--Yes, sir!

184
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,340
Tell everyone to wait on
standby until my next orders!

185
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,080
Yes, sir!

186
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,970
Continue moving forward.

187
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,710
You can't be serious! There's no
telling what's in the waters ahead!

188
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,060
It's too risky!

189
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,820
That again?

190
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,940
Then have them prepare a small craft.

191
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,900
You're not seriously going to...!

192
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,280
That's right. I'm going on my own.

193
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,580
Huh? It's just fog...

194
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,750
I thought Nami was in
big trouble again or something...

195
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,670
What in the world's going on?!

196
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,810
What was that?

197
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,780
Our own ship was right in front of us...

198
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,950
And then we went right through it... right?

199
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,250
I can't see anything at all!

200
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,820
It was almost like... a mirage...

201
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,270
A mirage? That's it!

202
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,190
I read about this a long time ago!

203
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,910
It said temperature differences
between warm and cold ocean water

204
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,640
can create mirages at sea!

205
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,030
Is this a mirage, too?

206
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,660
Urgh! What's the deal with this sea?!

207
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,850
Dammit! What're you doing?!

208
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,580
Shut up! I can't help it,
you damn bastard!

209
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,990
Sanji-kun! Zoro!

210
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,230
Let's raise the sails! Undo the ropes!

211
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,360
Yes, Nami-san!

212
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,200
You stay in the cabin!

213
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,120
No! I'm going to stay
by Grandpa Ryu's side!

214
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,960
You idiot! There's nothing you
can do by staying with him!

215
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,290
I'm sure he's feeling lonesome!
I hafta hurry to him!

216
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,330
Hey!

217
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,090
Just sit down and shut up!

218
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,520
Hurry! We need to hurry back
down and get out of danger!

219
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,250
For some reason it seems...

220
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,800
...like this sea's trying
to push the ship back.

221
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,900
Grandpa Ryu!

222
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,110
Grandpa Ryu!

223
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,280
Don't worry! This storm is no big deal at--!

224
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,630
No!

225
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,010
Zoro!

226
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,130
Grandpa Ryu! No! What are you saying?!

227
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,860
We will save you! Don't give up!

228
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,860
We promised we'd go
to your nest together!

229
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,410
Gum-Gum...

230
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,000
...Lasso!

231
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,350
Nami-san! There's light over there!

232
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,010
That's the eye of the typhoon!

233
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,710
Hey! I see an island below that light!

234
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,320
We're going to land there!

235
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,640
Luffy!

236
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,420
Don't worry! Leave it to me!

237
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,600
We're taking him to
the dragons' nest, right?!

238
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,470
Yeah!

239
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,140
Stormy seas surround the island...

240
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,420
It's almost like they're trying
to keep people away from it...

241
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,700
That must be why nobody's
ever found it before, huh?

242
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,760
But it seems more like a castle
that's sunk into the sea than an island...

243
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,240
Whoa! Check it out!

244
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,320
Doesn't that seem shaped like a dragon?!

245
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,770
This must be where the
Millennial Dragon lives after all!

246
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,300
Wow! Dragons sure are skillful!

247
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,110
You idiot! It was obviously
humans who made this building!

248
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,440
Well, whatever.

249
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,720
We made it to Lost Island!

250
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,860
But does anyone even live here anymore?

251
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,530
The whole place has been
swallowed up by Mother Nature...

252
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,870
Say, where do you suppose
the dragons' nest is?

253
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,750
Hey!

254
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,920
Grandpa Ryu!
I'm talking to you, Grandpa Ryu!

255
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,170
Sheesh! We're at the
dragon nest island now!

256
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,170
Come on, wake up!

257
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,920
What did he say?

258
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,850
He says he's not sure...

259
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,520
He says this might not be Lost Island...

260
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,690
What?!

261
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,980
You can't be serious!

262
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,780
We went all the way through
that stormy sea just to get here!

263
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,780
Apis!

264
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,770
Look at the top there!

265
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,780
We could look down at the
whole island from up there!

266
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,540
Yeah! Trying to figure things
out here won't get us anywhere!

267
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Let's go have a look!

268
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,200
Okay!

269
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
Alright! Let's go!

270
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,080
Stupid Nami makes
the men do all the work...

271
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,300
It's like, "Try pushing it yourself!"

272
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,800
Hey, you! Less complaining
and more pushing!

273
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,630
Don't start getting cocky, you!

274
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,570
Quit complaining and push!

275
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,310
Ah! Nami-san is so nice
when she's snappy!

276
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,270
If only!

277
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,760
It's a city...

278
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,000
Wow! Everything is broken everywhere!

279
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,260
Did people really used to live here?

280
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,060
Obviously, given all of these houses.

281
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,330
Then why's there no one here now?

282
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,580
Who knows? Maybe they found
a better island to live on.

283
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,470
The Millennial Dragon's mark...

284
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,940
Did the Millennial Dragon play
with children here on this island?

285
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,240
Hey! Are you guys friends
of the Millennial Dragon too?

286
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,180
Come on, Apis. Don't get left behind!

287
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,370
Guess what?!
These birds told me something!

288
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,550
They said there's a building
on the summit with a dragon mark!

289
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,130
For reals?!

290
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,880
It might be the dragons' nest!

291
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,500
Nami! Hurry up!

292
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,790
Wait for me!

293
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,550
Ready... go!

294
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,660
We finally made it... I can't go on...

295
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,970
Thanks for showing us the way!

296
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,090
We've sure come up a long ways.

297
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,160
Good work, everyone!

298
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,880
Yep! Good work!

299
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,450
This painting is of the
Millennial Dragon, right?

300
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,090
Yeah, it is.

301
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,840
This building is the dragons' nest?

302
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,640
This place?

303
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,320
Hold on! Where's the entrance?
How do we get inside?

304
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,260
This is the door!

305
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,540
You're so stupid!

306
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,450
There's no handle
or keyhole anywhere!

307
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,610
How're you supposed to open it?!

308
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,160
H-Hey!

309
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,130
Apis! That pendant... You don't mean...

310
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,500
It's actually a key that opens
the door to the dragons' nest?

311
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,050
Yeah.

312
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,010
Huh?

313
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,220
I can't reach...

314
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,100
You're so little, Apis!

315
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,120
So what?!

316
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,350
Alright! Leave it to me!

317
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,660
Huh?

318
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,730
Huh?!

319
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,620
We're alive... right?

320
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,610
Yeah, it seems that way...

321
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,240
Say, what was that about it
being a key just a minute ago?

322
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,200
Here!

323
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,290
Well, in any case, we're inside now.

324
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,710
It worked out!

325
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,250
But... what is this place?

326
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,780
Yeah... What is it?

327
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,060
What is this?

328
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

329
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

330
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,670
I'll set off by myself,

331
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,630
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

332
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,400
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

333
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,490
Why is it so hot?

334
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:55,490
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

335
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

336
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

337
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

338
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

339
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,270
Hey, now! Is this really Lost Island?!

340
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,450
See! Look at that! This means...

341
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,220
Look out!

342
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,240
That bastard!
He followed us all the way here?!

343
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,030
Alright! Let's fight! You too, Zoro!

344
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,990
I said stop already!

345
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,580
Oh, no! Now there's a huge armada!

346
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,120
On the next episode of One Piece!

347
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,170
"Showdown in the Ruins!
Tense Zoro vs. Eric!"

348
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
