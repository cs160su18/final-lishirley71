2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,320
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,010
The feelings of those who are in anguish

21
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,470
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,940
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,870
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

24
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,530
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

25
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Vivi and her friends continue to fight in
order to save Alabasta from its crisis...

26
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,420
Sanji was toyed with by Mr. 2, a master of
ballet kenpo, and fought a difficult battle.

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,540
However, during the battle, he figured
out the Clone Clone power's weak point

28
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,130
and finally emerged victorious.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,810
Meanwhile, Princess Vivi has
decided to destroy the palace

30
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,710
in order to save citizens' lives.

31
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,340
However, as the countdown to the
explosion began, Crocodile appeared.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,150
"Nami's Cyclone Advisory! Clima Takt Burst"

33
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,560
Luffy-san's dead...? You're lying!

34
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,850
It's not a lie.

35
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,520
Straw Hat is buried in the sands
of Rainbase, Miss Wednesday.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,100
If only he hadn't gotten involved
with you, he could've lived a long life.

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,730
There's no way he could be
killed by someone like you!

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,680
Well, it's thanks to their sacrifice
that you're able to rant right now.

39
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,710
Give them your deepest thanks,
so at least the dead can...

40
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,520
Where's Luffy-san?!

41
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,100
Why're you here?!

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,300
...rest in peace...

43
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,080
I can hear the sounds of battle from here...

44
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,470
So she wasn't able to stop
the rebel army at the entrance...

45
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
I wonder if Vivi and the others are okay...

46
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,880
They're all... fighting with their very lives...

47
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,420
And yet I'm...

48
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,160
Like I said...! I want a
more powerful weapon, too!

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,990
Powerful weapon...? What's the
point in you becoming strong?

50
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,330
It's true that I'm not a combatant,
I have a nice figure and I'm cute...

51
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,680
--Huh? Say what?
--...but I still...

52
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,940
...wanna be at least strong enough
not to cause the others trouble...

53
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,500
Especially this time, for Vivi...

54
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,430
Usopp... You can understand
how I feel, can't you?

55
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,410
We're different from them.

56
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:15,270
"Usopp Factory"

57
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,680
They're as strong as monsters.

58
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,570
They can fight against any enemy
using only their own power.

59
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,800
But you and I are ordinary
humans with no power.

60
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,330
Once the battle starts, we just
get flustered shamefully...

61
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,690
We'll just be a burden to the others,
unable to even protect ourselves.

62
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,760
When we're like that, if we wanna fight,

63
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,490
all we can do is depend on
powerful weapons... Right?

64
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,580
The reason you frantically
work on inventing weapons

65
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,020
is that you wanna have pride that you
can fight just like the others, right?

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,780
Me, too! I want to fight with
my own two hands, too, for Vivi!

67
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,510
So help me!

68
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,520
There isn't much time left
before we arrive in Alabasta.

69
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,320
Yeah... Also, there's no way that
I can get strong just like that...

70
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,540
I'm sorry for being unreasonable...

71
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,990
Who said it's unreasonable just
because we don't have time?

72
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,620
Are you saying that there's
something that Usopp-sama can't do?

73
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,620
Then...

74
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,480
...you're gonna do it?!
Oh, I love you! Thank you, Usopp!

75
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,550
Well then, let me get right to the point.
About the material cost...

76
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,340
Thank you, really!

77
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,890
Hey, hey, hey... It's not like
weapons can be created for free...

78
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,640
Well then, I'm counting on you!

79
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,850
Hey, listen to me!

80
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,280
You guys are off the hook now.

81
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,890
Nami-san...

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,680
What am I doing... getting
scared by a noise like that...?

83
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,340
...when I grandly boasted
in front of Usopp like that...

84
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,310
I'm prepared, aren't I...?

85
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,380
To fight for Vivi...

86
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,560
That's right... Usopp kept his promise.

87
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,230
In any case, I'll fight! If it's just
that woman, I should be able to...!

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,760
It's no use running, girl.

89
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,250
Miss Doublefinger! What was that
spear-like weapon she just used?

90
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,870
Does she also have Devil Fruit powers?

91
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,700
Do you get it now?

92
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm a spike person with
Spike Spike Fruit powers.

93
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,070
I can release spikes from
anywhere on my body.

94
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,490
Spikes that can easily
pierce through stone walls...

95
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,010
If I get caught even once,

96
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,960
she'll pierce my entire body with
those spikes, and that'll be it for me...

97
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,140
Oh? Don't tell me you're going to fight me...

98
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,090
That's right!

99
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,110
Sometimes, it calls forth clouds...
other times, it makes rain fall...

100
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,620
Yet other times, it produces wind...!

101
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,520
This miracle takt causes
catastrophes when it is re-arranged!

102
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,230
Take this! My new weapon, Clima Takt!

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,690
What... on earth...

104
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,400
First, sunny weather! Fine Tempo!

105
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,410
Wow, amazing! Doves flew out!

106
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,700
That was stupid!

107
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,470
Are you... okay?

108
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,920
The first shot is often like this...

109
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,890
We start by getting the enemy's
guard down, right? I get it, Usopp.

110
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,810
This time, it'll be the end
of you! Cloudy Tempo!

111
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,270
Wow! What pretty flowers!

112
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,670
No way I can win like this!

113
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,660
What the heck is this?! Say something!

114
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,040
I don't know her situation...
but what a poor child...

115
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,640
Hurry up! Vivi-sama is in danger!

116
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,190
Cannons! Bring cannons here!
Destroy the gate!

117
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,300
Hurry up!

118
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,340
Dieciseis Fleurs!

119
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
What the...

120
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,790
I hope we can have some peace and quiet now.

121
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,970
What a stubborn girl...

122
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,820
Don't you think it's pointless to
work so hard to dodge my attacks?

123
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,980
You have no chance.

124
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,030
You're wrong!

125
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,110
According to the instruction,
there're tons more attacks!

126
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,150
My Clima Takt!

127
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,280
When on earth... did you...

128
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,240
It wasn't me. You dropped it here...

129
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
Give it back to me!

130
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,000
Sure, I will. I'm not a magician, so...

131
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,860
And I do have enough power to fight
without depending on a thing like that.

132
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,470
Now be a good girl and stay right there.

133
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,350
Then I'll be able to kill you
without causing you much pain.

134
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,240
You still wanna continue
your fun magic show?

135
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,610
The weather forecast is thunder!
Thunder Tempo!

136
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,860
Thunder Tempo...
Thunder Tempo... Thunder...

137
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,710
Stinger... Finger...!

138
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,510
No!

139
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,020
My cheek is bleeding...

140
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,520
Ahh... I wonder if I'm gonna die like this...

141
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,490
I'm gonna die, aren't I...? I'm gonna die...!

142
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,960
If I die, I'm gonna curse him...
That long nose...! Long nose!

143
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,880
Why didn't he make a
real good battle weapo...

144
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,330
Hm...?

145
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Well, then... I'll kill you now... okay?

146
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,470
She's standing on the underside
of the bridge...! Why...?!

147
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,680
Stinger... Hedgehog!

148
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,690
That was close!

149
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,860
H-H-Hey, hold on! Stop!

150
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,610
I said hold on! Hold on a bit! A minute!
Would you give me a minute?! Hey!

151
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,950
I'll get caught if I'm in an open space!

152
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,000
This is it for you. Time to get skewered!

153
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,880
No... thanks!

154
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,290
Well, well...

155
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,110
It seems like she isn't a
total amateur in battles...

156
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,350
What was that...? I think
I read something ominous

157
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,480
in these Clima Takt instructions earlier...

158
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,620
Where was that?

159
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,200
That's it! I'm sure that if you use the
techniques I wrote up so far at parties,

160
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,750
people will love them and
the party will really heat up!

161
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,740
You gotta be kidding me!

162
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,560
Also, I'll write the configurations
for battle on the back.

163
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,210
The back?

164
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,940
Well... I wonder where you're
hiding this time, little kitty?

165
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,760
I won't run or hide any more.

166
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,350
I may not look it, but during the
eight years of my life as a thief,

167
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,250
I survived life-or-death
crises... all by myself!

168
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,510
I can't stand being treated
like just an ordinary girl.

169
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,940
Really... I'm sorry, then...

170
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,730
What's got you so
confident all of a sudden...?

171
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,940
Listen up, I'm gonna show
you my real ability now!

172
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,880
The battle configurations of the takt!

173
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,310
First, understand the
characteristics of the three takts!

174
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,160
Each of the takts can shoot off
air bubbles by shaking or blowing.

175
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,360
The first one shoots off hot air...

176
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,940
...a Heat Ball!

177
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,580
What is this? It feels warm.

178
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,500
The next one shoots off cool air...

179
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,490
...a Cool Ball!

180
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,020
Ah, it feels cool.

181
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,640
And the last one shoots off electricity...

182
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,730
...a Thunder Ball!

183
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,770
Oh, no... that tingled.

184
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,810
These techniques aren't complete yet,
so if you use them at parties...

185
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,020
Then don't write them down!

186
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,370
Are you happy now?

187
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,430
Sewing Stinger!

188
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,060
Please, something I can use! Not for
entertainment, but some techniques!

189
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,010
I'm sorry...

190
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,420
Enough is enough.

191
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,800
Stinger Step!

192
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,370
Oh, I get it! The Heat Ball and the Cool Ball!

193
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,420
When they stop spinning, the air bubbles
hit each other, create an air flow

194
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,680
and cause a tremendous wind!

195
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,480
This is incredible, Usopp!

196
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,180
The Cyclone Tempo is like
an ordinary boomerang.

197
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,980
If you go outside after
a party and play with it...

198
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,760
He doesn't seem to understand it himself...

199
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,270
But with this, I might be able to...

200
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,120
She uses a strange weapon...!

201
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,350
Pay attention until one of us wins!

202
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,040
To show your back to your
enemy during the battle...

203
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,820
Aren't you taking a battle
to the death too lightly?

204
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,260
I changed the air density
by using the Cool Ball.

205
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,430
An abnormal refraction of light due to
a considerable temperature difference...

206
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,210
In other words...

207
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,370
A mirage...! Can't be...
when it was this close...

208
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,800
We can't win with power. At any rate,
survive by using your brain!

209
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,860
That's how we fight, right?!

210
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,060
If I use it efficiently,
even a miracle can happen!

211
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,070
Looks like this is a perfect weapon for me!

212
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,460
Now I've figured out the Clima Takt!

213
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,780
Just give up!

214
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,330
Father!

215
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,260
Let His Majesty go, Crocodile!

216
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,880
Hey, hey... You really think
that I'd agree to let him go

217
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,670
after going through all the trouble
to immobilize him like that?

218
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,850
Seriously... try and use your head...

219
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,870
I'm sorry, Vivi...

220
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:28,540
I couldn't make full use of the chance
that you risked your life to create...

221
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,860
Father...

222
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,130
Good grief... Is this how a father and daughter
talk after being separated for so long?

223
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,630
Anyway, Miss Wednesday...

224
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,430
Don't call me by that name!

225
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,640
Let me tell you something first. I don't
intend to keep you and your father alive.

226
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,760
When a kingdom dies out, it's just
natural for its royal family to die as well.

227
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,940
Right?

228
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,650
However, before I take the throne,

229
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,830
there's something that I need
to ask you, the current king.

230
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,000
In fact, this is indeed my biggest goal...

231
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,680
Cobra... Where is the Pluton?

232
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,410
How... do you know that name...?

233
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,790
I always wanted to talk about it

234
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:31,340
I couldn't even say half of it

235
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:41,850
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

236
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:54,570
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

237
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,770
Glory glory you're my shine

238
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:06,530
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

239
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:12,280
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

240
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,730
I'm sure I'll make it there

241
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,170
Tornado Tempo! That's the
centerpiece of this weapon!

242
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,970
If you miss, consider it over.

243
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,790
I'll make the last technique successful!

244
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,590
What is Pluton?

245
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,850
It must be sleeping somewhere in this country.

246
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,930
That's been my goal from the start.

247
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,560
Such a thing exists in this country...?

248
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

249
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,450
"Secret Passed Down in the Royal Family!
The Ancient Weapon Pluton"

250
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,660
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
