2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,700
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,730
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,030
Blackbeard who acquired Whitebeard's
power now is in a standoff with

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,450
the Navy at the plaza!

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,560
Meanwhile, Jimbei rushed to the bay
head carrying the unconscious Luffy

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,580
but they got attacked by Admiral Akainu!

65
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,170
Good job, you young Navy soldier.

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,440
The courageous moments that you
created by risking your life

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,220
just now have changed...

68
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,520
...the future of the world
tremendously - for better or worse.

69
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,650
I'm here to...

70
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,330
...end this war!

71
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,840
"Here Comes Shanks! The War
of the Best is Finally Over!"

72
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,310
"Red-Haired"! He is the one who
motivated Luffy to become a pirate!

73
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,530
There he is!

74
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,930
It's the Red Hair Pirates!

75
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,930
Prepare for surgery! Both of them
are bleeding uncontrollably!

76
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,560
We need to prepare for transfusions!

77
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,650
Captain, it's dangerous!

78
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,980
Sure, you can't often see The Four
Emperors but close the door already!

79
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,490
No way!

80
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,010
"Red-Haired" had a run-in with Kaido,
another one of The Four Emperors,

81
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,960
just yesterday in the New World!

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,500
And he made it here already?!

83
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,760
Sh... Shanks?!

84
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,430
Why the hell are you here?!

85
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,680
Buggy!

86
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,390
The straw hat?!

87
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,100
Give it back to Luffy!

88
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,440
Why should I?!

89
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,400
I refuse! I was just trying hard to fade out!

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,450
I don't wanna draw their attention anymore!

91
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,360
Oh no! That's too bad!

92
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,530
There's a treasure map
that I wanted to give you!

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,450
Really?!

94
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,200
Yes and it's a great one!

95
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,560
Yeah, right! Don't think that
I'm gonna fall for a deal

96
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
that is too good to be true!

97
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,800
Okay, then I gotta ask somebody else...

98
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,470
Al-Alright, hang on! I'm
gonna go give it to him!

99
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,390
Boss!

100
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,270
You haven't seen Luffy for 10 years.
Don't you wanna see him?

101
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,320
Yeah, maybe...

102
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,060
He got you good, boss!

103
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,090
Why are you laughing?!

104
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,800
That was so uncool! Why
didn't you fight them?!

105
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,300
No matter how many there are
or how strong they seem,

106
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,080
you're not men--or pirates - if you
laugh after something like that!

107
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,780
Hey, don't cry! You're a man!

108
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,530
But... Shanks...!

109
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,490
Your arm!

110
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,700
It's only an arm. It's no big deal.

111
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,250
I'm just glad you're alright...

112
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,890
Yeah, I wanna see him.

113
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,390
Captain! Captain!

114
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,920
They're gonna attack us
if we don't submerge soon!

115
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,020
Please close the door!

116
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,360
Okay.

117
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,990
--Wait a minute!
--I can't wait anymore!

118
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,910
Oh no!

119
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,410
This was left behind! Here, catch it!

120
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,460
He threw something.

121
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,050
--This is...
--Captain, hurry up, hurry up!

122
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
Okay.

123
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,830
I wanna see him but...

124
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,700
I'll leave this hat with you.

125
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,580
Come bring it back to me someday!

126
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,780
Once you've become a great pirate!

127
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,930
That's our promise, Luffy!

128
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,270
If I see you now,

129
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,980
it means I fail to keep the
promise, doesn't it, Luffy?

130
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,040
Alright, let's do this.

131
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,460
This one's been shot through his
stomach and he's barely alive.

132
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,990
Straw Hat-ya is severely injured too but I

133
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,460
think there are more problems deep inside.

134
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,670
Do they need anesthesia?

135
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,840
No, they don't.

136
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,000
They're both so seriously
hurt that they can't feel any pain.

137
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,350
They don't have the energy to complain

138
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,640
no matter how drastic the remedy will be.

139
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,990
It's gonna be a fun operation!

140
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,400
"Red-Haired", you bastard! You
let Dragon's son get away!

141
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,740
Ice Age!

142
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,830
He's after the submarine!
The sea is gonna be frozen!

143
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,830
His pulse is steadying.

144
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,560
What's that?

145
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,020
It's an emergency! The water
is starting to turn into ice!

146
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,190
Oh no! Oh no!

147
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,690
If nothing is done, we're
gonna get caught, Captain!

148
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,140
Do something!

149
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,410
We'll submerge rapidly!

150
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,220
Did I lose him?

151
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,520
W-We made it!

152
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,250
Yasakani Sacred Jewel!

153
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,500
What is it this time?!

154
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go deeper--to the bottom of the sea!

155
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,090
It's gonna hit us! I'm sure
that it's gonna hit us!

156
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,550
Hurry up! At full speed!

157
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,140
Luffy!

158
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,400
--Damn! They're so persistent!
--It didn't hit them, did it?!

159
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,530
Ace's brother! Jimbei!

160
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,580
Luffy...

161
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,350
If they're still alive after this,

162
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,270
we have no choice but to let
them go and count them lucky!

163
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,390
Why is that Navy ship taking off on its own?

164
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,820
Hurry up! Go after the submarine!

165
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,140
But they went underwater

166
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,830
and I don't think that they could've

167
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,890
escaped the attacks from the admirals!

168
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,330
No, I'm sure that they're alive!

169
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,000
Listen to me!

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,170
Tell the Navy that, being a Warlord,

171
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,870
I will catch  and kill Straw
Hat Luffy at any cost!

172
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,010
Y-Yes, ma'am!

173
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,880
--But I don't know where we should go...
--Shut up and advance!

174
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,200
She's reckless but beautiful!

175
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,840
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...

176
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,340
What did you just say?!

177
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,310
You lied about the treasure map?!

178
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,770
Y-You bastard!

179
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,470
I just said that on the
spur of the moment, Buggy!

180
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,310
It's been awhile, huh?

181
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,940
Cut the "It's been awhile, huh?" crap!

182
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,150
Don't forget that I have a reason
to be mad at you, Shanks!

183
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,950
--What's that?
--Don't forget about it!

184
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,580
If you didn't surprise me at that time,

185
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,880
I wouldn't have lost the treasure
map and become a Devil Fruit eater!

186
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,010
Is that what happened?

187
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,260
Thank you for that great reaction.

188
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,640
I always hated that about you!

189
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,650
How could you made me work for
free as soon as we met again!

190
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,970
You said you were here to
stop the war or something

191
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,160
but I can start a war with
you right now if you want!

192
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,120
--Did you see that?
--Yes, I did.

193
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,040
He has such sass, even against
"Red-Haired" of The Four Emperors...

194
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,510
Captain Buggy!

195
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,720
We will follow you for the rest of our lives!

196
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,760
I understand so just relax.

197
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,140
Say what?!

198
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,090
But, wait a minute!

199
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:08,440
If I stay with them, I can
get off this island safely!

200
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,580
"Red-Haired"...

201
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,130
Marco.

202
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,550
Stop fighting back. Just
back out nice and easy.

203
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,300
"Hawk-Eye", where are you going?

204
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,750
I agreed to fight Whitebeard

205
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,020
but fighting "Red-Haired"
is not in the agreement.

206
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,860
It's time to quit.

207
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,470
If you continue desiring more and more,

208
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,710
it will just increase the damage
on both sides purposelessly.

209
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,150
Those of you who only want to fight more...

210
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,440
Bring it on! We're happy to fight you!

211
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,870
What do you think, Teach?

212
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,390
I mean, Blackbeard!

213
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,370
You're more handsome than ever, "Red-Haired".

214
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,360
Those scars look good on you.

215
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,760
Let's stop this, then!

216
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,600
I already got what I wanted.

217
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,770
And we're not ready to fight you guys yet.

218
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,550
Let's go, guys!

219
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,360
Everybody.

220
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,070
For now,

221
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,220
you need to do as I say!

222
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,170
Looks like our coverage of
the war will soon be over!

223
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,820
Whitebeard, Ace...

224
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,980
Let us handle the burial of those two.

225
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,380
The war was broadcast to the world.

226
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,420
I won't let you dishonor their
death in public any longer!

227
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,870
That's ridiculous!

228
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,220
We raise a shout of victory by exposing
their dead bodies to public view!

229
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,820
Vice Admiral is right!

230
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,780
Are you trying to bring
disgrace to our victory?!

231
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,030
We're not gonna listen to a pirate!

232
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,450
I agree!

233
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,740
Fleet Admiral-dono!

234
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,290
Only because it's you, I
allow it, "Red-Haired"!

235
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,490
But...!

236
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,490
I will take the blame on myself!

237
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,970
Thanks.

238
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,800
Treat the injured now!

239
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,640
This war is...

240
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,200
...over!

241
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,660
Those of you who are able, help the medics!

242
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,290
Carry for the seriously injured ones first!

243
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,540
Don't let anyone else die here!

244
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,590
Thus, the biggest war since the
beginning of the Great Pirate Era -

245
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,930
the War of the Best in Marineford has ended

246
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,620
and so it will be recorded in history.

247
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,670
The "War of the Best" has shattered
the balance of the world.

248
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,380
The end of the war becomes the sign

249
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,570
for the pirates to set out
upon the wave of a new era.

250
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,310
With the menace that was Whitebeard gone,

251
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,640
the seas are growing rough again.

252
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,280
On the next episode of One Piece!

253
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,850
"Mighty Leaders Face Each Other
Down! Heralding the 'New Era'!"

254
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
