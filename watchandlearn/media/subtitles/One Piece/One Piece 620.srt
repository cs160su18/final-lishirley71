00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,570
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,610
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,440
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,410

At any cost, One Piece,

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,530

67
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,390
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,720
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,510
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

74
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,580
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,050
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,050
The Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

78
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,050
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

79
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,000
and landed on Punk Hazard;

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,140
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen.

81
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,300
They learned about the ruler
of the island and the puppeteer

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,540
of Shinokuni - Caesar Clown's motive

83
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,560
and along with their pirate ally -
the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,590
they are caught in a climactic battle.

85
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,450
And they finally defeated Caesar.

86
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,290
Smoker! The least I can do is...

87
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,080
...take you along to hell with me!

88
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,620
Monet. I can't believe you're alive.

89
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,660
Vergo's been beaten.

90
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,400
It's all because of my misjudgment.

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,320
I feel bad for you all.

92
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,490
But I want to make sure
to wipe out all those squirts now.

93
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,730
At the Third Laboratory, there
is another weapon that was

94
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,010
responsible for destroying the
First and Second Laboratory

95
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,580
and the rest of the
island four years ago.

96
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,460
With just the push of a button,

97
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,380
there will be only one survivor on the whole island.

98
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,270
No one else can take
that highly toxic gas.

99
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,880
And that's Caesar!

100
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,730
The button is at...

101
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,310
You don't have to say it, Joker.

102
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,800
I was gonna do that, anyway.

103
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,740
Thank you.

104
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,260
I need you to perish along
with everything else.

105
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,520
Understood.

106
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,320
"A Critical Situation!
Punk Hazard Explodes!"

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,810
It's fast!

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,500
Hey, get off of him!

109
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,170
I won't!

110
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,660
Hey, you're heavy! Get off!

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,050
Why is there a dragon here?!

112
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,350
Oh, I met him at a garbage dump.

113
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,300
You brought him with you?

114
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,770
It's no mistake!

115
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,960
Father!

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,810
What's wrong with him?

117
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,730
Father!

118
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,550
The eel is gonna attack me!

119
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,910
Hey, Momo!

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,080
Who is this dragon? He said "Father."

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,930
Find out later.

122
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,470
I don't see any light.
The exit must be farther away.

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,950
How far did Caesar fly?!

124
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,510
This is it for you!

125
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,110
Smoker!

126
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,980
The Straw Hats.

127
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,740
Trafalgar Law.

128
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,990
G-5.

129
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,300
Poor children.

130
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,090
You all...

131
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,820
...have to...

132
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,570
...die with me.

133
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,150
Goodbye, Young Master.

134
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,930
I know you will become...

135
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,530
...the King of the Pirates.

136
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,640
Why is the Transponder Snail
still receiving the signal?

137
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,820
Are you okay?

138
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,220
Uh-huh!

139
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,940
Seems like there was an explosion!

140
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,210
I think it was in D Building.

141
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,060
The SAD Manufacturing
Room where I was before.

142
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,460
Monet.

143
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,190
Goodbye, Smoker!

144
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,980
What happened, Monet?

145
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,570
Young Master...

146
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,750
Hey, Law.

147
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,030
If we can get out of here,
we'll go separate ways.

148
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,880
But there is something
I want to ask you.

149
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
What?

150
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,700
This is yours.

151
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,410
I thought Caesar had my heart.

152
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,780
How did it end up in your hands?

153
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,920
He just got the wrong idea.

154
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,740
Let me keep your heart!

155
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,760
And that's a deal!

156
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,470
To earn the trust of Caesar,

157
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,520
I let him keep my heart

158
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,960
and took his secretary
Monet's heart in return.

159
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,150
Now it's a deal!

160
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,860
And then I cut your heart
out when you got to the lab.

161
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,410
So I had two hearts in my possession.

162
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,580
The Navy G-5 Vice
Admiral Smoker's heart!

163
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,050
What a nice gift, Law.

164
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,810
I gave his secretary Monet's heart
back to him out of kindness.

165
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,910
Respond.

166
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,800
Monet.

167
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,610
As they say, if you are kind to people,

168
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,290
good things will happen to you.

169
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,940
How did you like it?
This Missile Girl's...

170
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,660
...flame of love?

171
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,510
Hey, Baby 5!

172
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,870
Do you need this weapon?
Even though you're a weapon woman yourself.

173
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,150
Thank you for picking it up, Buffalo!

174
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,710
That's my good luck charm!

175
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,630
An owner of this weapon is
destined to become happy

176
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,980
and if you buy this,
you'd make me happy, too!

177
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,310
What?! He...

178
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,240
...needs me!

179
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,770
I'm absolutely sure that he fooled you!

180
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,430
Behind you-dasuyan!

181
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,040
I don't know who you are but...

182
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:27,530
I'm an invincible Iron Pirate!

183
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,350
I don't fight for the peace of the sea!

184
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,830
--Iron Pirate!
--How persistent!

185
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,530
Weapon-morphosis!

186
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,900
Revolver Girl!

187
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,660
Oh! It doesn't work!

188
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,420
It just made me itchy!

189
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
This guy's pretty tough!

190
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,390
Baby 5!

191
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,940
Catch it!

192
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,190
Thanks, Buffalo!

193
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,590
It's not over yet!

194
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,400
This is no good!
It's collapsing faster!

195
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,480
Look out!

196
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,920
The passage is gonna collapse!

197
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,600
We're in a tunnel through a mountain.
If it collapses, we'll be buried alive.

198
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,660
Don't say it in a relaxed matter!

199
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,870
Oh no! The wreckage blocked our way!

200
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,590
Where are the brakes?!

201
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,380
Keep going.

202
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,250
What?!

203
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,620
Cool!

204
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,290
Can't believe it! He saved us!

205
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,520
I don't want him to be my enemy!
Although he already is!

206
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,630
Don't get too comfortable yet.

207
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,680
The deadly gas!

208
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,740
You've got to be kidding!

209
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,400
It's that thing again.

210
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Is it flowing in through
cracks of walls?

211
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,020
It's gonna be more than
just being buried alive.

212
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,370
Stop saying such horrible things
in a cool manner!

213
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,900
There is going to be
gas around the exit.

214
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,000
Can anybody here generate wind?

215
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,940
What?

216
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,460
It's not so easy to find a person
with such a special skill!

217
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,650
I can do that.

218
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,100
How easy?!

219
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,970
I see the exit!

220
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,150
Alright, we're almost there!

221
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,500
Go faster!

222
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,040
Young Master!

223
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,810
Young Master?

224
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,980
Young Master?

225
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,780
Young Master!

226
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,440
I can't find him.

227
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,340
Young Master!

228
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,750
The Young Master is nowhere to be found.

229
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,750
He must be in the room
on the fourth floor.

230
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,990
Uh-uh! He wasn't there.

231
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,110
The window was open.

232
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,040
Oh, okay.

233
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,890
Then I don't know where he is.

234
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,240
He went out by himself again.

235
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,640
It's me. Tell me what's
going on over there.

236
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,450
W-We've actually been blocked by
some kind of iron guard!

237
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,120
Is it still safe there?

238
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,570
Yes, it is!

239
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,590
Which means the island and those squirts
haven't been wiped out.

240
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,450
You two.

241
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,980
Take care of that guard.

242
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,410
I'm on my way!
