2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,820
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,750
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,000
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,640
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,440
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,910
drove people around
the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,210
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,800
Find it!

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,880
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,060
Having defeated
Duval's Flying Fish Riders,

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,810
Straw Hat Luffy and company
now head for Fish-Man Island.

51
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,420
So, umm...

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,230
What do you say, Nami?

53
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,200
This doesn't mean
you're suddenly somehow forgiven.

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,130
No! Of course not!

55
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,040
That's not what I meant!

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,070
I was just wondering how it tastes!

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,870
It's really good!

58
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,160
Really?! It is?!

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,540
First, there are actually two routes
that lead to the New World!

60
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,010
But for outlaws like you guys,
there's really only one.

61
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,220
Just maintain course
for the route you'll use,

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,580
which is known as Fish-Man Island's

63
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,430
"Sea Floor Route"!

64
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,530
The Red Line is a large barrier
that stretches all around the world,

65
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,150
but there is one small hole
in one part of it,

66
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,360
and that's where Fish-Man Island is!

67
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,780
In order to make their ship
capable of submerging to the sea floor,

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,030
Luffy and company
needed to visit a certain island first.

69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,780
This is it!

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,870
Sabaody Archipelago!

71
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,080
Awesome!

72
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,550
Oh! It came outta the ground!

73
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,840
Neat!

74
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,510
I'm riding it!

75
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,640
That looks fun!

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
Say, Hachi.

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,600
What's our purpose
on this island, anyway?

78
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,810
Oh, we're going to see
a coating craftsman

79
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,020
and have him cover your ship in resin.

80
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,960
Simply put, that'll make it
so your ship can go underwater.

81
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,990
Are you serious?!

82
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,330
And so Luffy and company landed
on the Sabaody Archipelago

83
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,280
to find a coating craftsman Hachi knows.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,840
"Tyranny! The Rulers of Sabaody,
the Celestial Dragons"

85
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,850
Everyone's gone into town.

86
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
You guys aren't going?

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,670
Nah, we used up all the cola
in that last sea battle.

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,780
The ship's maintenance is my job!

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,230
And I'm stayin' behind
because I wanna help, of course!

90
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,450
Let's all three of us
go when we're done!

91
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,790
This island looks like fun!

92
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,130
No,

93
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,590
I'm gonna wait for someone to come back
and then go shopping.

94
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,840
Huh? How come?

95
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,590
Actually, you see...

96
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,340
It's because my beloved
Nami-san said this...

97
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,090
Whatever will I do?

98
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,460
The ship is so full
of treasure right now...

99
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,450
I wish there was a knight somewhere
who could protect it for me...

100
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,100
Tadah!

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
It's me!

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,980
You sure know how to fall
right into Nami's hands.

103
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,140
I'm a slave of love!

104
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,170
Admitting it yourself saves me trouble.

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,800
Hey! Zoro!

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,370
Earth to Zoro-kun!

107
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,540
Where are you going all by yourself?!

108
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,010
Just for a walk...

109
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,490
Stop!

110
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,730
Don't you dare, you damn bastard!
You always get lost!

111
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,850
This is an archipelago, you know!

112
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,500
We'll never be able to find you!

113
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,260
I ain't gonna get lost!

114
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,530
As if anyone could get lost on such
straightforward islands as these!

115
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,910
All the trees are numbered!

116
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,560
Worst case, even a kid could make
it back by asking for directions!

117
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,210
Oh!

118
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,370
I never expected you
to have such street-smarts!

119
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,690
We underestimated you!

120
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,990
Sorry! Take care!

121
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,760
Make sure to ask for directions!

122
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,940
Don't trust yourself!

123
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,960
I dunno what the hell
they're talking about!

124
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,540
I just need to remember
this tree's number.

125
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,770
#1. Okay.

126
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,240
They can mock me all they want;

127
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,380
I'll never get lost on these islands!

128
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,840
Unlike some other guy
with no sense of direction!

129
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,300
The World Nobles are also known
as the Celestial Dragons.

130
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,870
They act so high and mighty
that they wear masks

131
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,450
to keep from breathing
the same air as common people.

132
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,320
Whatever you do, don't defy them!

133
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,630
That's one thing you have to promise!

134
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,080
Sure!

135
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,280
There are a couple other things
to watch out for, too.

136
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,130
Like I mentioned before,

137
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,480
people heading for the New World
gather on these islands.

138
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,530
There are infamous
pirates like you here,

139
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,010
as well as marines and bounty hunters
who are out to catch them.

140
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,680
Not to mention kidnappers!

141
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,270
There's no law here at all
against buying and selling pirates.

142
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,290
Do anything to stand out
and they'll set their sights on you,

143
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,190
so be very careful what you do!

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,440
The marines here
aren't pushovers, either.

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,160
Navy Headquarters is in
nearby waters, you see.

146
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,620
Which is why the bounty hunters
are all just as ferocious.

147
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,620
And one other thing!

148
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,090
Oh, come on!

149
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,030
There are too many things
to watch out for!

150
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,960
Hey, when did you get hurt there?

151
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
Oh, this? Don't worry about it.

152
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,750
Camie and I aren't merfolk
or fish-men here.

153
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,430
Treat us like we're human
on these islands.

154
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,060
Huh? How come?

155
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,180
It'll make things a lot simpler.

156
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,430
When in a city,
do as its citizens do, Luffy.

157
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,780
Let's do as Mr. Octopus says.

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,500
Harder! And push into it slowly!

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,380
I'm inside!

160
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,530
Neat!

161
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,680
How curious!

162
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,320
I can get in! I can get in!

163
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
It's not leaking at all!

164
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,140
All right, then!

165
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,140
Put this inside.

166
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,990
Like this?

167
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,970
Is that high enough for ya?

168
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,360
You'll go forward now if you peddle.

169
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,240
Oh! It's going forward!

170
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,620
Awesome!

171
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,540
This is fun!

172
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,750
Yahoo!

173
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,000
It really doesn't pop!

174
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,210
Convenient, huh?

175
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,810
They're Sabaody Archipelago's
famous Bubble Bikes!

176
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,960
I wanna ride too!

177
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,960
Whadya say?

178
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,100
It's 500 Berries a day to rent one,
or 10,000 Berries to buy one!

179
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Pretty cheap, huh?

180
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,530
I think we'll rent--

181
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,510
I want it!

182
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,560
I'll buy this one
with my spending money!

183
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,730
Me, too! Me, too!

184
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,640
Forget it!

185
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,270
Let's just rent.
There's no point in buying one.

186
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,280
Why do you get to decide?!

187
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,940
Yeah!

188
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,460
Urgh! I'll explain later!

189
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,240
We'll rent two more, mister!

190
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,070
Huh? You're from around these parts?
What a bummer...

191
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,920
This feels so nice!

192
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,500
Doesn't it, though?!

193
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,400
They even have different kinds.

194
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,560
It makes me want to sing now!

195
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,510
I think I'm gonna buy
a Bubble Bike after all!

196
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,670
Straw Hat.

197
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,760
You know how you first went up
into the sky on those bubbles?

198
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,060
Why did you come falling down?

199
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,250
Oh! Actually, I went
past the tops of the trees

200
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,980
and wondered if I could
go any higher up...

201
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,660
...when all the bubbles
around me disappeared

202
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,880
and the bubble I was on
suddenly popped too...

203
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,540
Then I fell.

204
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,290
You must have left
Sabaody Archipelago's climate area, then.

205
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,990
This place has a suitable climate
for Hustle Mustle Mangroves to grow.

206
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,370
Outside that area,

207
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,910
the resin components in the bubbles
lose a lot of their capabilities.

208
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,600
I see.

209
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,220
Then that means the bubbles
can't be ridden outside of these islands?

210
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,530
That's right.

211
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,290
Newcomers here often buy Bubble Bikes
and take them with them.

212
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,760
That's a dirty business.

213
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,320
Renting Bubble Bikes is all you need.

214
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,960
No! I'm buying one!

215
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,780
'Cause I can't agree
with that explanation!

216
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,160
You just don't understand it!

217
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,560
Basically, the bubbles will pop
outside of these islands,

218
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,090
mysteriously enough!

219
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,660
What?! They pop mysteriously?!

220
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,160
Why didn't you say so sooner!

221
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,130
We have been trying to tell you!

222
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,800
But you can use it on
Fish-Man Island, Luffy-chin!

223
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,340
There's a bubble civilization
on the sea floor, too!

224
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,910
I wanna go to Fish-Man Island
right away!

225
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,930
I can't wait!

226
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,670
Then you should meet
the Mermaid Princess!

227
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,480
She's a girl of matchless beauty!

228
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm a panderer; shall I hook you up?!

229
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,850
That sounds splendid!

230
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,230
I love having an eyeful
of beautiful girls!

231
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,810
Though I lack eyes,
due to being a skeleton.

232
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,660
Wait, are you even listening?

233
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,860
Ooh, that smells good!

234
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,660
What's a "Grand-Bun"?

235
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,120
"Grand-Bun" "GR Famous Food"

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,370
"GR Famous Grand-choco!!"
"GR Famous Grand-Bun!!"

237
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,360
Grand Line Manju buns!
Commonly called Grand-Buns!

238
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,460
How about a taste test?

239
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,010
See how they say
"Grandline First Half" here?

240
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,120
They're very popular as souvenirs
for going into the New World!

241
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,130
They last for three whole months,
so you can rest easy!

242
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,720
These are delicious!

243
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,490
Could I ask you to open the next box?

244
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,650
Are you planning to pay?!

245
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,330
Grove #35.

246
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,680
There seem to be a lot of hotels here.

247
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,830
They're for the sailors who're waiting
for their passes from Marie Jois.

248
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,480
Building hotels is easy, you know!

249
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,920
See, look over there!

250
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,670
Paint a giant bubble with a metal alloy
and you have your foundation!

251
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,700
That's how round buildings are made!

252
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,790
Oh?

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,050
Robin!

254
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,930
Look! Is that a shopping mall?!

255
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,930
Come again!

256
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,060
Grand-cracker! Grand-choco!

257
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,380
Keychain!

258
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,220
Pennant!

259
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,980
You guys are all about the memories!

260
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,270
You really bought a lot!

261
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,100
It'd be tough to lug all that around.

262
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,780
Have 'im bubble pack it for you.

263
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,450
Bubble pack?

264
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,060
It's so light!

265
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,580
You don't need strength
to carry stuff on these islands!

266
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,450
Upsy-daisy...

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,370
Huh? Where are Nami and Robin?

268
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,730
They went to the shopping mall
in Grove #30.

269
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,100
They left us in charge
of getting the ship coated.

270
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,300
Oh? They did?

271
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,460
Okay! Leave it to us!

272
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,010
Where are we headed again?

273
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,080
Grove #13.

274
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,270
It's still a ways away,
even by Bubble Bike.

275
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,720
Let's go!

276
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,530
Camie-chan didn't come along
when we invited her...

277
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,550
Yeah.

278
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,580
She's been a bit reserved
ever since we landed on these islands.

279
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,320
I wonder what's up with her...

280
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,160
Who knows, perhaps this island
has a bad history...

281
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,790
Bad history?

282
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,940
Yahoo!

283
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,020
It's so fast!

284
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,090
Huh? Where's Straw Hat?

285
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,760
Over here!

286
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,560
Straw Hat!

287
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,230
I'm in the lead now!

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,260
You won't beat me!

289
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,440
We still have a long way to go!

290
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,820
Go, Hatchin!

291
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,900
What?!

292
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,320
When did this suddenly
turn into a race?!

293
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,340
I'm sorry!

294
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,560
U-uhh, umm...

295
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,660
I-I'm sorry!

296
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,330
Please stop!

297
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,230
Take it off!

298
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,430
Please! Take...

299
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,280
Take this off!

300
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,300
I...

301
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,070
I'm...

302
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,820
...going back home now!

303
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,750
What's all that noise?

304
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,460
Please! Hey!
I beg of you!

305
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,510
Anyone will do!

306
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,960
Just lend me an axe or a saw

307
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,260
or anything!

308
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,640
Please!

309
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,560
I'm just going to break this collar!

310
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,730
I won't hurt anyone!

311
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,370
Please let me go!

312
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,650
I don't want to die!

313
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,720
I've given up on the New World!

314
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,340
I have a wife and kid back home!

315
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,770
Come on! Please!
Help me out!

316
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,530
I wanna go home!

317
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,660
My kid was just a baby back then!

318
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,670
The bugger still doesn't
even know what I look like!

319
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,460
I'm begging you!

320
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,170
Who's that?

321
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,880
I wanna go home! Please!

322
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,090
I beg of you!

323
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,860
Don't get involved, now.

324
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,810
He's probably a pirate who was caught
by kidnappers and then sold!

325
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,020
His owners brought him to this island,

326
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,850
and then he ran away!

327
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,520
Even though he surely knows
there's no escape!

328
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,490
W-What's that sound?

329
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
Damn this collar!

330
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,870
If only... If only it wasn't for this!

331
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,840
Damn it! No!

332
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,550
No! Stop!

333
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,050
I... I...!

334
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,650
Damn it!

335
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,000
Slaves always have leashes
around their necks

336
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,200
that are set to explode if the slaves
try to remove them and escape.

337
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm gonna buy souvenirs and go home...

338
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,240
I'm giving up the pirate business...

339
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,540
It's an escaped slave!

340
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,460
Get away!

341
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,720
Don't get involved with him!

342
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,440
H-Hey! We need to help that person!

343
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,060
You idiot!

344
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,350
You promised not to get involved,
no matter what happens!

345
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,020
What's with this town?!

346
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,900
Hatchin! What should we do?!

347
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,950
There are Celestial Dragons nearby!

348
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,950
It's okay.

349
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,910
Just stay calm, Camie.

350
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,220
Straw Hat.

351
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,450
Come down from the Bubble Bike.

352
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,700
How come?

353
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,950
Just hurry!

354
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,170
Okay... Got it.

355
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,380
Here they come!

356
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,240
That's a Celestial Dra--?

357
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,350
You kneel down, too!

358
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,610
What's the big idea?!

359
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,020
Whoever comes,
don't look them in the eyes!

360
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,240
Same for you guys, too!

361
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,980
Right!

362
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,900
Oh, my! How disgraceful, Saruu!

363
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,010
Is that them?

364
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,820
Yeah.

365
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,280
Dear me, Father.

366
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,180
Another one has broken down.

367
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,600
Did you remember to give it
a sedative every day?

368
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,300
I most certainly did.

369
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,390
It has no effect on the poor fool.

370
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,530
Please buy me a new one.

371
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,220
Honestly, now!

372
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,240
You're terrible at taking care of them!

373
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,200
You keep breaking everything
in my ship captain collection...

374
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,200
It's this thing's fault.

375
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,620
A grown man, always crying
about family this, family that!

376
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,940
When he's nothing but a mere human!

377
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,090
Honestly, now!

378
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,050
He's not doing anything now...!

379
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,490
You make me sick.

380
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,190
--She's--!
--Stop! Please!

381
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,390
I think I would like
a giant for a slave next.

382
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,160
No, you will start with a human child.

383
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,900
I don't like such weak ones!

384
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,970
Please! Just endure it!

385
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,160
It's the navy!

386
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,790
Outta the way!

387
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,360
We need to get out of here for now!

388
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,450
Would you like some tea?

389
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,700
It will help you relax.

390
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,960
I don't feel very good now...

391
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,260
That guy...

392
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,950
Do you think he'll survive?

393
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,200
Even if he does,

394
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,100
he'll probably go to prison,
seeing that he's a pirate.

395
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,220
That pirate could've easily
beaten that old man and lady!

396
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,860
So why...?!

397
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,580
Harm a Celestial Dragon

398
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,340
and a Navy HQ admiral
will lead an entire army here!

399
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,920
An admiral?!

400
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,620
Aokiji?!

401
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,980
It could even be Akainu or Kizaru...

402
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,330
There's no way of knowing.

403
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,920
Navy Headquarters
is very close by, you see.

404
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,000
What makes them so high and mighty?!

405
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,250
They share the Creators' blood!

406
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,880
Creators?

407
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,390
The twenty kings who created the huge
World Government organization

408
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,210
800 years ago!

409
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,880
Their descendents are
the Celestial Dragons.

410
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,810
With each passing generation,
they grow more reckless with power,

411
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,310
which is why they act like that now.

412
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,070
Celestial Dragons...

413
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,400
That him?

414
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,370
Yeah.

415
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,760
No doubt about it.

416
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,200
Straw Hat Luffy.

417
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,910
300 million Berries!

418
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,880
Shakky's Rip-Off Bar?!

419
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,820
Monkey-chan, is it? Welcome.

420
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,340
You know about me?!

421
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,590
Of course, I would know of the 300 million Berries, Luffy.

422
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,250
However, there are currently,

423
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,850
people with higher bounties than you.

424
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,310
Higher than Luffy?!

425
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

426
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,350
New Rivals Gather! The 11 Supernovas

427
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,710
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
