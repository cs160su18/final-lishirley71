00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,010
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,800
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,440
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,250
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,910
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,440
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,880
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,490
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm sorry!

35
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,310
I'm sorry for being bullheaded!

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,070
I was wrong!

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
Luffy...

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,020
You idiot! Grab my hand already!

39
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,710
"Wanted Posters Make It Around the World!
Celebration in Their Hometowns

40
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,680
as the Ship Moves Forward!"

41
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,110
Meteor... Fist!

42
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,830
L-Luffy-san...

43
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,620
Vice Admiral Garp sure doesn't show
any mercy, even to his own grandson.

44
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,920
"Navy"

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,830
Go, our town's heroes!

46
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,920
Don't be taken out by the Navy!

47
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,720
Hey, rooting for them could get us in trouble!

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,680
Go, Straw Hats!

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,490
Run, run, then keep running!

50
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,020
Bro!

51
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,870
Huh?

52
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,870
Wh-What the heck? They're furling the sails?

53
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,920
I wonder if they gave up.

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,320
Give up?

55
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,670
I doubt Luffy's given up,
but then, just what is he up to?

56
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,550
Hurry up! Furl the sails!

57
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,130
Yeah! Furl the sails!

58
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,480
Hey! Are you really sure about this, Franky?!

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,890
Huh? Are you asking me if I'm really sure?!

60
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,750
You dummy! Have faith in this ship!

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,100
He's right! Have faith in it, you dummy!

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,860
You jerk! You dummy!

63
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,020
Usopp, just a minute ago, you were...

64
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,220
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

65
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,320
Give me a hand, you bastards!

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,410
Seriously, what the hell are they
thinking at a damn busy time like this?!

67
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,110
Franky, I've furled the sails, as you said to.

68
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,000
We'd better hurry up, or the
battleship will catch up with us.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,060
Not quite yet.

70
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,810
Huh?

71
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,170
We still haven't named this ship yet.

72
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,290
Name?! At a time like this?!

73
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,180
That's right. You don't wanna depart
in an unnamed ship, do you?

74
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,560
What the hell?

75
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,100
Then, a name like "Something-or-other Lion"?

76
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,340
Okay! I got a name that sounds strong!

77
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,720
The "Bear! Polar Bear! Lion!"

78
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,860
No one would give a ship
a weird name like that!

79
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,270
Then, the "Tiger! Wolf! Lion!"

80
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,170
Stop just listing animal names like that!
What is it, some sort of a curse?!

81
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,580
"Squid! Octopus! Chimpanzee!"

82
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,040
Now you're not even putting "lion" in it!

83
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,660
Well, "lion" is on the right track.
But the Galley-La guys were like...

84
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
This figurehead looks good.

85
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,960
Oh, that's a nice sunflower!

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,630
It's not a sunflower, you idiots!

87
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,140
Well, it's just natural that
you guys wouldn't get it right.

88
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,480
But this is a ship that the future
King of the Pirates will board.

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,070
So you made it with that
hope in mind, right, Franky?

90
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,400
That's right. He'll set sail into
a sea filled with savage beasts

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,070
and rise to the top. So I wanted
a figurehead suitable for that.

92
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,440
That's a splendid sun!

93
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,940
It's not a sun, you idiot!

94
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:33,060
A ship that'll cross a thousand rigorous
oceans cheerfully, just like the sun...

95
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,620
It's perfect for them!

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,660
I said it's not a sun, you Stupid-berg!

97
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,050
What do you think about this
for the ship's name, Franky?

98
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,960
The pirate ship...

99
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,220
...Thousand Sunny!

100
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,350
Whoa!

101
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,080
That sounds cool!

102
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,000
That's better than the "Dumpling!
Gorilla! Lion!" name I came up with!

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,190
What is this, a word game?!

104
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,720
That sounds better than
"Boss Lionel" that crossed my mind...

105
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,250
Better than the "Darkness" that I thought of...

106
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,160
Better than the "Monsieur
Sunflower" that I thought of...

107
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Have you guys lost your marbles?!

108
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,830
A ship that crosses a thousand oceans...

109
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,080
How lovely! And so is the sun!

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,460
Wait, you guys! That was
just to start things off.

111
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,890
The one I came up with sounds a lot better!

112
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,050
Here's my name for the ship!

113
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,720
--The "New Battle Franky,
Lion Gang Champion"!
--Let's use what Ice pops came up with! I like it!

114
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,890
--"Lion Gang Champion"!
--"Thousand Sunny," huh? That's a good name!

115
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,180
--I agree!
--Let's get along, Sunny!

116
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,970
I guess deciding on the ship's name has
helped us brace ourselves for departure.

117
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,140
I agree.

118
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,900
Hey, Franky, what're you
booing about over there?

119
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,960
Hurry up and shake them off with
the secret weapon or whatever.

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,450
Yeah, you'd better hurry up.
The battleship is already nearby.

121
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,700
All right, fine, stop bugging me!

122
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,190
Take a last look at this beautiful
city of water while you can.

123
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,660
In just a second, this island
is going to be out of sight.

124
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,040
I see. Then...

125
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,020
Grandpa!

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,140
And Coby and...

127
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,910
I was glad I got to see you
after such a long time!

128
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,520
Call my name, too!

129
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,780
What, Luffy? I've got more cannonballs left!

130
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,480
Meteor... Fist!

131
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,620
It's no use!

132
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,150
We're gonna run with all our might now!

133
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,670
I'll see you guys again someday!

134
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,790
Luffy-san's cool!

135
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,180
How dare you talk cheeky?!
You're nothing but my kid's kid! Luffy!

136
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,470
Vice Admiral Garp, please calm down a little!

137
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,890
Ice pops! We decided to use the
name you came up with for the ship!

138
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,110
Thanks for the nice name!

139
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,110
Everyone! Thanks for everything!
We're taking off!

140
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,530
It sounds like he's saying something.

141
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,400
We can't even make it out.

142
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,120
Seems like pirates can't even
depart without making a racket.

143
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,360
Here we go!

144
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,180
This is an astonishing emergency
accelerator made with a huge air cannon

145
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,810
taking advantage of the strength
of the treasure tree Adam!

146
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,630
"Navy"

147
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,220
A-A massive iron ball!

148
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Luffy!

149
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,310
What the heck is that?

150
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,480
Ahhh! We're gonna die!

151
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,860
No way we'll survive that! That's not possible!

152
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,970
If you underestimate me...

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,820
R-Run, Luffy-san! You're gonna get killed!

154
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,200
Franky! Hurry!

155
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,500
...you'll get hurt!

156
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,300
We're gonna die!

157
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,640
Coup de Burst!

158
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,440
The ship... flew... away.

159
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,580
Not bad.

160
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,980
Cool!

161
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,970
I remember experiencing this feeling before.

162
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,060
Merry...

163
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,560
It consumes three barrels of cola,
but it lets us fly one kilometer.

164
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,500
There's nothing the Going Merry
could do that this ship can't.

165
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,030
It exceeds the Merry in every way.

166
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,700
But the Merry's brave soul will be
inherited by the Thousand Sunny.

167
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,830
If it breaks down, I'll fix it perfectly!

168
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,120
When it comes to the ship and weapons,
rely on me for anything!

169
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,830
From today on, this is your ship!

170
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,590
Yeah!

171
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,680
"Navy"

172
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
They sure showed me.

173
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,310
They escaped.

174
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,330
That's my grandson!

175
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,180
After all, he didn't come with us.

176
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,740
Of course he wouldn't.
But the king of snipers promised us

177
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,750
that he'd come to Elbaf
some day with his friends.

178
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,830
I'll look forward to it.

179
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,470
We'll wait patiently.
A giant's life span is 300 years.

180
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,320
We did some good work!

181
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,430
Yeah. Now, let's go back
to our work place, shall we?

182
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,290
Or do we wanna go get a drink?

183
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,350
All right, I'm in!

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,150
We're heading back to
the station, Chimney, Gonbe.

185
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,920
Let's see... How did Bro do things?

186
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,580
Beats me.

187
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,570
We were just doing whatever
he told us to do, so...

188
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,910
We're gonna starve to death like this, huh?

189
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,780
Iceberg!

190
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,350
Well... I knew this would happen.

191
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,790
Wh-What?! What'd you come here for?!

192
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,290
If you're worried about work,
I can give you some.

193
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,030
Come to Galley-La's headquarters
one by one, one per day, every day.

194
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,800
What?! Are you sure, Iceber... I mean, Bro?!

195
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,790
New Bro!

196
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,470
Don't call me that.

197
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,910
"An island in the Grand Line"

198
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,810
Commodore Smoker!

199
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,910
Thank you for your help, sir!

200
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,210
Huh? The bounty on that pirate
I just caught is 50 million?

201
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,410
Yes, sir!

202
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,830
How ridiculous! What kind of
criteria does the Navy use?!

203
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,920
Geez, the days sure are boring...

204
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,210
Smoker-san!

205
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,590
Ensign Tashigi!

206
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,260
Have you seen the wanted posters?
The Straw Hats are...

207
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,210
Who are you talking to?

208
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,220
What?

209
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,030
Ah! I-I'm sorry!

210
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,770
Wear your glasses, you idiot.

211
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,360
We're marines after all.

212
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,060
Since the Navy is hierarchical in nature,

213
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,990
there's a limit to my freedom
so long as I'm only a captain.

214
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,020
What we need now is higher ranks.

215
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,780
After the incident in Enies Lobby,
pirates all around the world

216
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,250
started acknowledging that
the Straw Hats have the edge.

217
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,710
Yes.

218
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,420
On my pride, I'm gonna crush
them in the New World!

219
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,590
"Sea Restaurant 'Baratie,'
East Blue"

220
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,720
The judicial island Enies Lobby is the front door

221
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,930
that leads to the World Government,
a huge organization.

222
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,120
Now that they've caused it to fall,

223
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,480
neither the Navy nor pirates
will leave them alone.

224
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,990
You can say that the Straw Hats
are now known all around the world.

225
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,450
And so is this wanted poster.

226
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,650
Sanji! You're the best!

227
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,580
Isn't this incredible?!
It's the spitting image of him!

228
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,450
Black Foot Sanji with a
77-million bounty used to work here!

229
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,590
We hope you'll come visit us again
here at the sea restaurant Baratie!

230
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,550
"'Fusha Village' (Luffy's hometown),
East Blue"

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,340
Party time! Let's have a party today!

232
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,370
He's the most successful one in the
East Blue with a 300-million bounty!

233
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,770
Cheers to our Luffy!

234
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,080
Shut up, you idiots!

235
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,440
Shame on you!

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,620
Cheers!

237
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,910
Stop it!

238
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,330
Seriously... No one's listening to me,
the mayor of the village.

239
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,720
Luffy seems like he's having a fun life.
He's got such a cute pet, too.

240
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,670
So these kids are his friends, huh?

241
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,900
"Friends"? They don't look friendly to me!

242
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,130
Someone from our village
became a vicious criminal

243
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,180
that made the entire world his enemy!

244
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,120
I've never heard of pirates picking
a fight with the World Government!

245
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,850
Yeah, that's true.

246
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,090
To start with, what is Garp doing,

247
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,560
allowing his own grandson to run
free and commit such a crime?

248
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,250
Something's wrong with that whole family.

249
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,070
Does Dadan know about this?

250
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,060
Cheers!

251
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,530
Like I said, shut up!

252
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,490
"'Syrup Village' (Usopp's hometown),
East Blue"

253
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,510
King of snipers... Yes!
There's no mistake about it!

254
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,780
This is Usopp-san!

255
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,460
--Right?
--This nose has to be our captain's!

256
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,380
Yes!

257
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,700
People at the village wouldn't believe us!

258
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,450
Well, his bounty is 30 million, so...

259
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,590
But we thought you'd agree, Kaya-san!

260
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,310
They don't know how incredible our captain is!

261
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,900
Our captain turns all lies into truth!

262
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,150
This mask looks cool!

263
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,640
Let's make it using clay!

264
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,340
Oh? Where are you going, Kaya-san?

265
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,540
I'll go home and continue
studying to become a doctor.

266
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,780
I'd better hurry up and
become a full-fledged doctor

267
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,950
so that I can treat Usopp-san if
he's injured when he comes back.

268
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,020
I envy Captain.

269
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,510
Let's hit him if he makes Kaya-san unhappy.

270
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,750
Yep!

271

Sensei! Sensei!

273
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,970
Is it true that the Pirate Hunter Zoro

274
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,250
used to train at this dojo?

275
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,230
Yes, that's true.

276
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,220
But you kids shouldn't look up to him, okay?

277
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,610
What?

278
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,340
Why? He's so cool!

279
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,720
Teach us how to become pirates, too!

280
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,640
I didn't teach him how to become a pirate.

281
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,610
Are you telling the truth?
Don't play favorites, Sensei!

282
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,400
--Good grief, what a troublesome alumnus.
--He's amazing! I wanna
be a swordsman like him!

283
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,390
I sure was surprised to hear about
the incident on the judicial island,

284
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,700
but Zoro-kun, I think there's
no doubt in your mind.

285
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,640
No matter who you become,

286
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,950
if you're faithful to your swordsmanship,
that's all that matters.

289
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,870
Here, I brought some tangerines.

290
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,750
What, you brought them again, Nojiko?
I told you I'd buy them at the store.

291
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,080
Well, just take them.
Don't act like we're strangers.

292
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,050
I think of you like a father to Nami and I, so...

293
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,310
I was never consulted.

294
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,430
What're you doing?

295
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,260
Hm? Oh, this...

296
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,650
I've been calling the Navy Headquarters
to complain, but I can't get through at all!

297
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,910
Complain?

298
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,650
That's right!

299
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,550
They can't just release a lewd wanted
poster like this to the entire world!

300
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,370
She'll have more suitors after her
than bounty hunters! Outrageous!

301
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,620
But you like that picture itself, right?
You did blow it up quite a bit.

302
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,460
Well, let it go, because this
proves that they're keeping...

303
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,340
But if you guys ever do anything
to take away Nami's smile...

304
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,460
...I will come kill you!

305
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,430
...the promise they made you, right?

306
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,090
W-Well, it's true, but...

307
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,580
...that's those pirates' business, not mine.

308
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,540
Then, would you have preferred
if she looked rough in the picture?

309
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,060
No! That'd be outrageous!

I can let you use some of the rooms.

317
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,960
Well, I like living in this familiar village.

318
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,100
Also, I like rice cooked with chestnuts.

319
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,170
Oh? These are those Straw Hat lads.

320
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,070
These wanted posters were issued
after the big incident the other day.

321
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,240
Chopper...!

322
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,610
I think his bounty amount
is some sort of a mistake.

323
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,740
I don't care as long as I can see his face.

324
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,930
I see... This is wonderful news.

325
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,710
"The sand kingdom 'Alabasta,'
Grand Line"

326
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,710
Wh-What?!

327
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,880
Nico Robin... Why is Miss All Sunday
a member of Luffy-kun's gang?

328
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,750
She surely was a mysterious woman,

329
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,010
so much so that something about
her stuck in my mind, but...

330
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,980
If Vivi-sama finds this out,
she'll probably feel very sad.

331
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,730
Oh, that. I already know,
but it doesn't bother me at all.

332
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,660
I-It doesn't bother you at all? I thought
you'd be more shocked than anyone.

333
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,510
Even if you stayed close to Luffy-san,
you wouldn't understand what he's thinking.

334
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,580
It's just a waste of time thinking about it,
but you can trust everything they do.

335
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,800
He's the man who'll be King of the Pirates.

336
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,960
He's of quite a different caliber.

337
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,060
How magnanimous! You've grown, Vivi-sama.

338
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,930
Hey, why are you crying?

339
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:50,850
"Land of white soil 'Baltigo,'
Grand Line"

340
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,850
The rebel group took Centaurea in the South Blue.

341
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,230
Another country has fallen...

342
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,460
We did it! Now the North Blue's--

343
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,230
This is no cause for rejoicing. This is a war.

344
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,440
Y-Yes, sir, I'm sorry.

345
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,540
What's this?

346
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,160
Oh, it's Straw Hat Luffy.

347
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,240
He's the guy who actually
defeated Crocodile in Alabasta.

348
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,800
After the incident in Enies Lobby,
his pirate group is becoming so big

349
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,670
that the government can no
longer hide their existence.

350
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,590
The total bounty for the entire group
is 667 million and 50 Berries.

351
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,530
I heard that their captain is the
grandson of Garp from the Na...

352
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,190
Where are you going?

353
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,470
I'm going to get some air.

354
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,610
Live as you please, Luffy.

355
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,230
In the flow of time, as a result of
various circumstances and strong spirits...

356
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:55,000
"'The World's Most Heinous Criminal'
Revolutionist Dragon (Monkey D. Dragon)"

357
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,670
...people come to question the world they live in!

358
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,500
The day we meet will come at some point.

359
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
Guys!

360
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,720
Do you have it?

361
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,270
Yeah!

362
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,680
Well then, once again...

363
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,050
To Robin and Usopp, who came back to us,

364
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,270
to our new friend, Franky...

365
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,940
...and to our pirate ship, the Thousand Sunny!

366
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,920
--Cheers!
--Cheers!

367
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,560
Let's go! Our next destination is Fishman Island!

368
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,950
Yeah!

369
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,400
Blackbeard, is that the power you
gained by killing your comrade?

370
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,680
Ace, you can't defeat me now.

371
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,800
What?

372
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,350
I've gained the power I need
to fulfill my ambition!

373
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,880
On the next episode of One Piece!

374
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,820
"The Most Heinous Power!
Blackbeard's Darkness Attacks Ace!"

375
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
