00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,130
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,690
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,540
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,780
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

25
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
and a mighty swell.

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,620
At long last, Luffy's group reached
Crocodile's base in Rainbase.

27
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,940
However, waiting for them there

28
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,380
were marines led by Captain
Smoker of Navy Headquarters.

29
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,210
While fending off the marines
and Baroque Works' Millions,

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,020
Luffy's party storms the Raindinners
Casino, where Crocodile is.

31
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,560
"The Trap of Certain Defeat!
Storming Raindinners"

32
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,050
I know you're in there, Crocodile!

33
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,350
Get back here, you!

34
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,090
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

35
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,320
Damn, they're annoying!

36
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,110
That quieted things a bit.

37
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,900
Crocodile!

38
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,330
Come out!

39
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,680
I came all this way to kick your ass!

40
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,850
Crocod--!

41
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,790
That's not gonna make him come out here!

42
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,330
We're dealing with the country's hero!

43
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,460
Are you trying to make these
patrons our enemies too?!

44
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,500
Alright! What do we do, then?!

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,710
H-Hold on! Without Vivi,
we won't know who Crocodile is!

46
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,930
Speaking of which, where is Vivi?!

47
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,510
Vivi! Crocodile! Where are you?!

48
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,330
Hey, now!

49
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,970
Assistant Manager! Some strange
people have come inside!

50
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,220
Have security take care of 'em.
Don't make such a fuss!

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,940
Hey! Vivi and Crocodile aren't coming!

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,170
I've got you now, Straw Hat!

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,360
Smoker!

54
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,010
You think you can just
scurry all over the place!

55
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,770
It's Smokey!

56
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,840
R-Run!

57
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,160
Damn! What's that smoke freak
doing here in Rainbase?!

58
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,430
I'd say he's taken quite a liking to Luffy!

59
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,290
This building is surrounded by
a lake! There's nowhere to run!

60
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,580
Please stop, sir!

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Government officials aren't allowed inside!

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,060
Move!

63
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,300
He's so stubborn!

64
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,880
Get back here!

65
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,840
I can't deal with that guy!

66
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,180
Just a minute, sir.

67
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,930
I must ask that you leave--

68
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,190
W-What the--?!

69
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,600
Huh? Did I just run into something?

70
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,460
Manager! This is terrible!
A strange group of people has...

71
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,980
Send them to the VIP room.

72
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,220
Owner Crocodile's orders.

73
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,060
Stop!

74
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,590
Hey! Look there!

75
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,040
Thank you...

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
...for coming!

77
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,700
Right this way!

78
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,510
This is the VIP room!

79
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,420
VIP room?!

80
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,130
Could it mean, "Bring it on"?!

81
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,390
This guy gets right to the point!

82
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,960
Alright! Let's go!

83
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,770
VIP?! What sort of connection
do they have with Crocodile?!

84
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,320
Depending on that, all of 'em
could get sent to the gallows!

85
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,830
But what's a VIP?!

86
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,900
Hey! The path splits!

87
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,600
VIPs go to the left!

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
And it says pirates go this way!

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,300
Which way do we go?!

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,620
Hurry and decide!

91
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,590
VIPs, obviously! VIPs!

92
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,980
But we're pirates! Pirates go this way!

93
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,300
Yeah! You got a point there!

94
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,160
W-Wait!

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,260
Straw Hat!

96
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,910
Huh?!

97
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,150
What in the world is going on?!

98
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,160
I can't believe we fell for this trick.

99
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,670
My "I Wind Up Swimming when
Falling in the Darkness" disease!

100
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,800
A trapdoor!

101
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,570
Where did everyone go?

102
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,980
Captain Smoker!

103
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,850
Where could Captain Smoker have gone?

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,590
He should be chasing Straw Hat, but...

105
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,050
S-She's with the Navy...

106
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,190
Oh no! My glasses!
My glasses! My glasses!

107
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,210
Now what?! I can't do
anything without my glasses!

108
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,730
Are you all right?!

109
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,480
Umm, have you fainted?!

110
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,340
Please, say something!

111
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,270
Sergeant Major Tashigi!

112
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,750
Oh, here you are!

113
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,730
Yes! I'll be right there!

114
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,080
Oh! Umm--!

115
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,680
Are these...

116
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,550
Oh, you found them for me!

117
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,610
You're such a nice person!

118
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,390
Eh?

119
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,070
Thank you! Goodbye!

120
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,070
This way!

121
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,850
Right!

122
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,650
She's a world-class dimwit, that's for sure.

123
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,080
She said I'm a nice person!

124
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,200
Being praised doesn't
make me happy, you moron!

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,450
Not to mention him.

126
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,080
A clever trap.

127
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,380
Yeah. It wasn't our fault.

128
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,410
We could have avoided it!

129
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,170
You did exactly what the enemy wanted!

130
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,850
I can't believe how stupid you are!

131
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,710
Anyways, I'm suddenly out of strength...

132
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,640
How come? Are you hungry or something?

133
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,940
Luffy!

134
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,270
Luffy!

135
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,460
I-I-I'll fight you if you want, smoke freak!

136
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,660
I once helped take down a bomb man!

137
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,030
Hiyaaa!

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,260
Huh? I have no strength...

139
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,870
Just like when I fall in water...

140
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,450
What have you done to Luffy?!

141
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,700
At the tip of this jutte is a
material known as Sea Prism Stone.

142
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,960
A strange type of stone that supposedly
only exists in one certain sea.

143
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,790
Not much is known about it,

144
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,070
but it basically gives off
the same energy as the ocean.

145
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,940
You can think of it as the sea in solid form.

146
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,730
So it makes Luffy weak?

147
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,670
All Navy HQ prison cells are made of it.

148
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,310
To prevent criminals with
Devil Fruit powers from escaping.

149
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,490
Then this prison cell is the same?!

150
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,910
If it weren't, I'd be long gone by now...

151
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,380
...after making it so none of
you take to the seas again!

152
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,290
Wait! Wait! What good will
fighting in this situation do?!

153
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,140
Besides, he's made of smoke!
Swords won't work on him!

154
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,510
That's correct. Give it up.

155
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,370
You're going to die together...

156
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,120
...so why not get along first?

157
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,550
Crocodile!

158
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,240
What?!

159
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,270
So he's one of the Seven Warlords?

160
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,820
Looks as despicable as I thought.

161
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,900
Oh, you really are the wild dog
I've heard about, Smoker-kun.

162
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,460
It seems you never once
believed I was on your side.

163
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,450
But, yes. You're correct.

164
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,270
Smoker. I think I'll have you
die an "accidental" death.

165
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,900
I'll inform the government
that you fought well

166
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,510
against the lowly "Straw Hat" pirate.

167
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,230
I don't know why you've
come to this country,

168
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,470
but I assume you're on your own.

169
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,860
The government would
never have sent you here.

170
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,730
Because everyone trusts me,
as a Warlord of the Sea.

171
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,440
So you're Crocodile?!

172
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,550
Hey! You! Fight me--

173
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,200
Pay attention! Don't touch the bars!

174
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,540
Straw Hat Luffy.
You've done well to come this far.

175
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,260
I promise to get rid of you,
so wait a little more.

176
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,170
Our guest of honor has yet to arrive.

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,450
Guest of honor?

178
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,920
I just sent my partner to pick her up.

179
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,370
I can't afford to waste time
in a place like this!

180
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,490
You've put up quite the fight, Princess.

181
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,580
I'd expect no less from
a former Frontier Agent!

182
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,400
But don't you think it's time
you accepted your fate?

183
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,370
I have to hurry to the others!

184
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,650
Now come! The boss is waiting!

185
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,650
Don't touch me!

186
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,520
W-What the--?! What's that bird?!

187
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,330
A falcon?!

188
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,700
What is a bird doing with machine guns?!

189
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,830
It's huge!

190
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,210
Shoot it down!

191
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,360
Crap! The princess!

192
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,140
Pell! You came for me!

193
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,230
It's good to see you again, Vivi-sama.

194
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,020
How is my father?!

195
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,480
He's well.

196
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,990
Both the king and I read your letter.

197
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,100
That means Karoo made it
to Alubarna safely?!

198
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,690
Yes. He's quite a duck.

199
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,830
Thank goodness!

200
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,790
Thanks to you and Igaram-san,
we know who we're fighting now.

201
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,990
Yes.

202
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Vivi-sama. Wait here a moment.

203
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,040
Pell?!

204
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,250
Not Pell the Falcon?!

205
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,250
H-He's the strongest warrior in Alabasta!

206
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,560
The Bird-Bird Fruit, Model Falcon!

207
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,070
Only five types in the world are
known to have the power of flight...

208
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,760
...which you can savor now!

209
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,870
S-Shoot! Shoot like crazy!

210
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,570
He vanished!

211
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,730
Flying Talons!

212
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,790
Thank you!

213
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,050
Now I have to hurry to the others!

214
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,950
Really?

215
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,590
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

216
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,150
You've been a real thorn in our side.

217
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,890
Miss All-Sunday!

218
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,990
It looks like our precious
employees are no longer usable...

219
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,960
Vice-President...

220
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,690
Who are you?!

221
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,810
That was magnificent.

222
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,480
I've never seen someone
who can fly before.

223
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,490
But, are you stronger than me?

224
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,000
Vivi-sama. I take it these are
the ones threatening our homeland?

225
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,860
I'd like to invite the
princess to our mansion.

226
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,960
What do you say?

227
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,840
Don't ask such pointless queries!
It's out of the question!

228
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,150
Oh.

229
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,640
Don't screw with us!

230
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,640
Princesses mustn't use such
uncouth words, Miss Wednesday.

231
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,120
How dare you kill Igaram...?

232
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,140
Igaram? Oh, Mr. 8?

233
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,700
Don't tell me you killed Igaram-san?!

234
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,150
What are you getting so worked up for?

235
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,810
How was that any different from
what you did to our employees?

236
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,090
It's silly.

237
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,170
Damn you!

238
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,310
Become sand of Alabasta!

239
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,800
Tres Fleurs.

240
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,930
Pell!

241
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,740
Vivi-sama! You're all right?!

242
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,870
Did it look like I killed this girl?

243
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,770
D-Damn you! What did you do?!

244
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,570
Don't be so angry. I only teased you.

245
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,810
You have Devil Fruit powers?!

246
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,160
That's right. I partook of
the Flower-Flower Fruit.

247
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,590
The power to make body
parts bloom like flowers.

248
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,070
This is my ability.

249
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,580
There is no escape from my body,
which can bloom anywhere.

250
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,070
Escape?! Nonsense!

251
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm going to avenge Igaram-san
right here, right now!

252
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,510
I'm sorry.

253
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,400
I'd like to play a little more,
but I don't have time.

254
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,770
That's all right! This won't take long!

255
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,240
It seems you still don't understand.

256
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,920
Seis Fleurs!

257
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,350
A submission hold?!

258
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,200
Power. Speed.

259
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,000
These mean nothing to me.

260
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,520
Clutch!

261
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,730
Pell!

262
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,150
He was the kingdom's greatest warrior?

263
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,180
N-No...

264
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,780
Now, let us go.

265
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,860
This can't be...

266
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,540
Our boss and your friends are waiting.

267
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,400
Inside a prison cell in Raindinners.

268
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,990
Look at me, I'm Sanji.

269
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,510
You the one who ate the meat?

270
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,370
--"Collier!"
--Act like...

271
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,230
--Here's Zoro! "Oni!"
--Act like...

272
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
...serious prisoners!

273
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,850
How can you act like that in such
a serious situation as this?!

274
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,060
We can't get out,
so what else is there to do?!

275
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,700
The fact we can't get out
is what makes it serious!

276
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
We might wind up dead
if we don't do something!

277
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,170
And why are you sleeping?!

278
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,890
Oh, is it morning?

279
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,430
It's noon!

280
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,220
You're a high-spirited girl.

281
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,800
Whatever! Go ahead and act
confident while you still can!

282
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,970
Once these guys get out of here,

283
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,310
they'll kick your butt and send
you flying above the clouds!

284
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,300
Isn't that right, Luffy?!

285
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,690
Of course it is, you jerk!

286
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,820
You seem to be quite the
trustworthy captain, Straw Hat Luffy.

287
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,120
Trust...

288
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,660
The most unneeded thing in this world.

289
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,630
Who does he think he is, insulting people?!

290
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,120
Q-Quit! You'll make him mad, too!

291
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,900
Crocodile!

292
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,960
Vivi!

293
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Welcome, Vivi, Princess of Alabasta!

294
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,880
No, Miss Wednesday!

295
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,970
I'm impressed you managed to evade
our assassins to come this far!

296
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,360
I would go as far as it takes!

297
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,700
Because I want you to die, Mr. 0!

298
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,940
If only you hadn't come to this country...

299
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,570
Wait! Vivi! Let us out!

300
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,030
...Alabasta would've remained peaceful!

301
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,460
Peacock String Slasher!

302
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,680
It's no use.

303
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,100
Satisfied?

304
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,910
As a citizen of this country,
you surely know

305
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,320
that I have the power
of the Sand-Sand Fruit.

306
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,910
Want to become a mummy?

307
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,500
A s-sand person!

308
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,990
Hey, you! Get away from Vivi!
I'll kick your ass!

309
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,450
Sit.

310
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,460
Perfect timing. The party is just starting.

311
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,530
Correct, Miss All-Sunday?

312
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,200
Yes.

313
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,890
Party?

314
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,210
It just turned noon.

315
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,670
Operation Utopia is beginning.

316
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,850
Operation Utopia?

317
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,140
What's an "Operation Utopia"?

318
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,540
Hey!

319
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,090
It will be this pathetic little
kingdom that dies, Miss Wednesday.

320
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,850
I'm going to wipe Alabasta
from the face of the earth!

321
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,430
All people, big and small,
will be sucked into eternal darkness

322
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,090
as they writhe in pain.

323
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,230
Let Operation Utopia...

324
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,340
...commence!

325
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,020
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

326
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,070
I continue on to the ends of emotion

327
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:38,710
I scoop up my hands, and the sand
and time that spills from them

328
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,680
show me that this is what
I was born to do

329
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:57,820
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

330
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:08,570
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

331
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,120
no one knows about

332
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,600
Alabasta is going to die?

333
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,360
What does he intend to do?!

334
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,140
The operation has begun.
This country will fall.

335
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,640
At the hands of the royal army,
the rebel army, and the people!

336
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,470
Love for the kingdom will be
what destroys the kingdom!

337
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,830
On the next episode of One Piece!

338
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,180
"Operation Utopia Commences!
The Swell of Rebellion Stirs"

339
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
