2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,240
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,780
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,320
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,540
While Buggy and Mr. 3 got out of level 4,

53
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,750
moribund Luffy had been treated by
Ivankov, the queen of New Kama Land...

54
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,090
...the land of vanished prisoners
and recovered miraculously!

55
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,260
I know what's going on in the world now.

56
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:09,100
The world is about to change with the Navy
and the Whitebeard Pirates as major players!

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,020
But he's not gonna make a move yet!

58
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,650
He's the mastermind of all revolutionaries
in the world and my comrade!

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,820
The revolutionary--Dragon!

60
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,780
Oh, you're talking about my dad.

61
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,070
What?!

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,290
Dragon is...

63
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,540
...your dad?!

64
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,600
After finding out that Luffy is Dragon's son,
Ivankov decided to accompany him in rescuing Ace!

65
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,260
The Vivre Card was pointing down
which means that he's still here!

66
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,210
Alright, Portgaz D. Ace!

67
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,890
We will take you to Marineford...

68
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,790
...where the execution ground is!

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,750
"Ace's Convoy Begins! Battle
on the Lowest Floor Level 6!"

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,470
Ace!

71
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,920
Hurry up!

72
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,940
Don't let them pass!

73
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,760
--They're coming!
--Move it! Move it! Move it!

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,930
Ready!

75
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,660
Gum-Gum...

76
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,310
...Pistol!

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,150
Dammit! Take this!

78
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,710
What an annoying trap! Ha!

79
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,450
Death Wink!

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,080
Heehaw!

81
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,080
We better hurry!

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,580
Oh! You're right! Hmmm?

83
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,760
W-Who are you people?!

84
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,180
Hey, you! Could you come
with us for a minute?

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,560
--No, wait! Let me go!
--Don't worry! You won't regret it!

86
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,850
Let's go! We can't spare even a second.

87
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,520
Don't hesitate! Attack him!

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,270
Clear the way! Gum-Gum...

89
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,590
...Ricochet!

90
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,080
The trap didn't work! And
the jailers are out cold!

91
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,660
Straw Hat Luffy! Ivankov--the king of queers!

92
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,790
Inazuma--the revolutionary!

93
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,630
The three criminals are
now entering... level 6!

94
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,630
Ace!

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,930
So this is level 6!

96
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,890
Only legendary criminals have been
held here in the Eternal Hell!

97
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,920
Where are you, Ace?!

98
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,960
I'm here to save you!

99
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,130
Ace, where are you?!

100
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,010
Ace!

101
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,120
You can't just yell blindly!

102
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,480
Would you like to tell us where he is?!

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,310
N-No, I would not!

104
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,520
Oh no, what should I do then?!

105
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,490
You have to be true to yourself!

106
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,070
W-What're you gonna do to me?!

107
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,780
Emporio...

108
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,240
...Female Hormone!

109
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,460
W-What happened?

110
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,780
Wow! He turned into a woman!

111
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,620
How do you like being your true self?

112
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,260
What?! Is that me?!

113
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,520
You're reborn!

114
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,100
You're not a jailer anymore,
you're a New Kama now!

115
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,330
Oh! How fabulous!

116
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,200
Thank you very much, Ivan-sama!
I found my true identity!

117
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,660
Oh, don't mention it!

118
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,620
--By the way...
--Where's Ace?!

119
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,160
That way!

120
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,220
Ace!

121
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,920
Is this it?!

122
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,020
Ace?!

123
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,610
He's not here!

124
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,320
Are you sure that this is the right cell?!

125
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,700
Yes, I am! I'm not lying...

126
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,810
We're a bit too late.

127
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,180
It's a straw hat! So he must be... Yes!

128
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,020
She said that my brother's here!

129
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,230
He's really here! He broke into
the impregnable Impel Down

130
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,360
and made it all the way down to level 6!

131
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,500
You're Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?

132
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,310
Yeah.

133
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,130
They took him just now!

134
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,200
Go! They've taken Ace-san to the elevator!

135
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,120
Go! You can still catch them!

136
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,700
Who're you, old man?

137
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,840
He's a big deal!

138
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,730
Okay, I got it!

139
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,770
Thank you! Whoever you are!

140
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,070
I can't believe it!--

141
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,870
Even after risking your life, it's almost
impossible to get all the way here!

142
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,670
Did he really get through all five hells?!

143
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,380
My brother would do something
like that! He does stupid things!

144
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,590
Since we were kids, he always
made me worry, that fool!

145
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,200
They took that to the upper floors!

146
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
Let's go!

147
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,350
They've left the iron door
to the elevator open!

148
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,560
Nice!

149
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,170
The operation system is locked! It's no good!

150
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,840
It doesn't work?!

151
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,260
But we can just climb!

152
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,430
Do it!

153
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,840
Okay!

154
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,260
T-That was close!

155
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,740
Of course, they wouldn't
allow us to climb it!

156
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,570
It's not usable! They're
already keeping an eye on it!

157
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,410
Let's go back up the stairs!

158
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,960
You can't get away!

159
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,880
Hey, they blocked the staircase!

160
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,390
They're trying to trap us!

161
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,350
We gotta break through! There's no other way!

162
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,480
Alright!

163
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,560
That's a lot of gas! Is it poisonous?!

164
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,270
Poison gas, again?!

165
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,940
Hey, you guys!

166
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,760
I don't know who you
are but don't make us suffer with you!

167
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,990
Shut up, you level 6 people!

168
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,080
-- I don't care if it's poisonous or not!
-- Wait!

169
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,540
It's sleeping gas!

170
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,580
How reckless you are, Straw boy!

171
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,090
You really need to stop...

172
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,260
We don't want to...

173
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,840
They wanna make us sleep
to stop us in our tracks!

174
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,640
Vice Warden, we've blocked
off level 6 completely!

175
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,770
The sleeping gas is potent
and there's no place to run!

176
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,270
Keep the guards armed and
on standby just in case!

177
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,610
Did you report to Warden Magellan?!

178
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,440
Just now!

179
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,610
Good!

180
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,660
My job is safe now!

181
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,160
Now I'll lay the blame on
Magellan for all of this mess

182
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,290
and then I'll become the warden...

183
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,910
The microphone's still on!

184
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,080
Whaaat?!

185
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,670
What unfortunate timing!

186
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,090
Straw Hat made it to level
6 just after we left!

187
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,970
L-Luffy!

188
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,980
We're completely trapped!

189
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,710
The emergency sleeping gas
has just been released!

190
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,170
It's only a matter of time
before they catch Straw Hat!

191
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,930
The Freezing Hell wasn't
punishment enough for him!

192
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,180
Since the cell that you were in is open now,

193
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,110
this time he'll be held on level
6 and will suffer greatly!

194
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,400
-- Luffy...
-- Don't stop! Keep walking!

195
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,780
You!

196
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,180
You better not resist because it's useless!

197
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,310
Luffy!

198
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,730
Your brother is also a pirate! There's
no way that he'll walk out of here alive.

199
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,610
I wished that she was lying!
Why did you come, Luffy?!

200
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,660
Anyway, no one can live after that much
poison no matter how strong he is!

201
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,660
How did you recover,

202
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,000
Straw Hat?!

203
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,630
We made it back to level 3!

204
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,010
We still got another half to go!

205
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,980
It was faster on our way down because
we often fell down accidentally!

206
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,150
I can't walk another step!

207
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,940
I'm thirsty!

208
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,320
What?! Let me take a break for a minute!

209
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,450
What are you...?!

210
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,960
Hello!

211
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,620
Gnocchi!

212
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,420
You're still here?!

213
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,010
Penne! Buckwheat noodle with an egg!

214
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,890
--Let us go!
--Let us go!

215
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,760
Buckwheat noodle with fried tofu!

216
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,840
Wheat-flour noodle in curry soup!

217
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,930
Wheat-flour noodle?!

218
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,100
Do something!

219
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,190
The floor's gonna be filled with gas!

220
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,690
Help me!

221
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,760
Who is he?!

222
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,460
He's cutting the floor like paper!

223
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,320
Now he's flipping the floor like paper!

224
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,790
He blocked the gas with the floor!

225
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,640
That's amazing!

226
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,580
Inazuma ate the Snip-Snip Fruit
and now he's a scissor-man!

227
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,170
He can manipulate whatever
he cuts as though it's paper!

228
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,470
Oh, really?

229
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,590
Wake up! I'm fighting off
the urge to sleep but I...

230
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,810
I...

231
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,390
...Don't sleep!

232
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,190
Were you kidding just now?!

233
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,310
You're awake!

234
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,400
I wanna keep going! Crab-chan!

235
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,990
You've blocked the staircase but
now I can't catch up with Ace!

236
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,410
That was the only way to stop the gas!

237
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,330
If you fall unconscious, you can't save him!

238
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,370
I'm gonna save him even if I'm
unconscious! I don't want him die!

239
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,290
Don't be ridiculous!

240
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,380
It's simple but their plan defeated us!

241
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,920
We're confined to level 6! There's
no way for us to get out!

242
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,930
I'm sorry but this is all I can do now!

243
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,560
They can't see us anymore!

244
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,190
You have to realize--we're too late!

245
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,070
They must've gotten to the top
floor with Ace boy by now!

246
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,330
On the other hand, we have a lot
of obstacles standing in our way!

247
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,070
The Navy's convoy is pretty
quick! Look at the Vivre Card!

248
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,750
It's not pointing straight up, is it?

249
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,880
I think that Ace has already
been handed over to the Navy!

250
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,220
You're right on time!

251
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,590
We transfer custody of the criminal
- Portgaz D. Ace to the Navy!

252
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,790
Here.

253
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,040
It's just a paper.

254
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,260
Yes, but that paper will
lead us to one another.

255
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,620
You don't want it?

256
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,640
No, I want it!

257
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,600
Luffy!

258
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,960
We need to move on now!

259
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,200
I'll do my best to help you break
out of this great prison safely!

260
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,500
They'll hand over Ace boy to the
Navy Headquarters at any cost!

261
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
You need to give up on him!

262
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,670
I mean, you need to trust Whitebeard.

263
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,010
He's not gonna give up on one of his
own! He'll definitely do something!

264
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,220
--I'm going!
--Huh?!

265
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,850
I'm gonna go to Navy headquarters!

266
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,560
Don't be stupid!

267
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,960
There's a battle brewing between
the world's two leading forces!

268
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,320
What can you do?!

269
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,400
Do you know how strong Whitebeard is?!

270
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,200
What about the admirals, vice-admirals,
and Warlords on the Navy side?!

271
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,750
Don't you remember that you fought
just Magellan and almost died?!

272
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,040
Do you have that many lives to spare?!

273
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,760
What?

274
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,900
If I give up now...

275
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,510
...I'm gonna regret it!

276
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,800
I've seen this face so many times before!

277
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,270
It's exactly like looking at Dragon!

278
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,720
But first of all, how can
you get off of this floor?!

279
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,280
If you wanna get out of here, set me free!

280
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,900
I can create a hole on the ceiling!

281
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,280
What do you think?

282
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,070
You're being held here?!

283
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,070
Crocodile!

284
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,950
It's been a while!

285
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,250
Straw Hat!

286
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,090
Joining forces with Crocodile and Jimbei, Luffy and the others plan their escape.

287
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,840
Meanwhile, Hannyabal takes note of their actions

288
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,510
and is determined to settle things for his
own gain, so he turns his gaze to level 4.

289
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,390
The final showdown between the Straw Hats
and Impel Down is about begin!

290
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

291
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,930
"The Ultimate Team Has Formed! Shaking Impel Down!"

292
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
