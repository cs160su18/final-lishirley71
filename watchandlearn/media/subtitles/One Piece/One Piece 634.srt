Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,640
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,940
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,360
Luffy and the others formed
a pirate alliance with Law

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,000
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,600
Their plan was to destroy the
SMILE manufacturing factory

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,700
and rescue a samurai

78
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,860
but after Zoro's sword was stolen,
they got separated.

79
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,180
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

80
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,520
at the Corrida Colosseum
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,590
he decided to enter.

82
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,470
The other competitors, however,

83
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,290
were the heavy hitters
from all over the world!

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,920
Hey you, right there.

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,830
That's no good.

86
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,020
There is a weight limit for gear.

87
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,600
Huh? Is that so?

88
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,540
Whatever you do,
there is no chance for you.

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,690
I will win the Flare-Flare Fruit.

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,110
Yes! That beautiful power belongs only to me.

91
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,460
"A Pirate Noble!
Cavendish!"

92
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,380
My name is Cavendish.

93
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,520
CAVENDISH OF THE WHITE HORSE

94
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,100
I didn't have to tell you my name because...

95
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,470
...everybody knows who I am.

96
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,460
THE CAPTAIN OF THE BEAUTIFUL PIRATES
BOUNTY: 280 MILLION BERRIES

97
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,020
How beautiful!

98
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,540
The "Pirate Noble" of the
white horse - Cavendish-sama!

99
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,050
Oh, I didn't expect to see you here!

100
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,200
How sinful it is to be this beautiful!

101
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,380
Perfect as this rose. That is what I am.

102
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,450
I've been blessed with
everything all my life.

103
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,930
Because I've made it this far without

104
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,640
eating a Devil Fruit or even really trying.

105
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,190
Just with my natural gifts!

106
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,430
You're overweight.

107
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,540
What?!

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,980
I told you earlier! Come here!

109
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,180
Tsk! I look awesome this way!

110
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,500
That's why everybody's half-naked.

111
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,230
Everybody's excited!

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,930
Do you know what makes them so excited?

113
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,340
It's blood.

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Gladiators are just part of a show for them.

115
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,340
People get excited seeing a loser's blood.

116
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,150
At the Colosseum, people
really show their true color.

117
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,190
They're bottling up frustration,
fear, and anger everyday

118
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,710
and hiding their bestiality
deep inside of them.

119
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,770
But they want to let it all out.

120
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,030
Who wants to see a prolonged match
between heavily armored competitors?

121
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,640
For them, this competition is just a show.

122
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,170
Should I take off this cape, too?

123
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,560
But it looks so good!

124
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,880
Hey you.

125
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,070
I was watching you take
down that big guy earlier.

126
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,580
Who are you?

127
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm Luffy!

128
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,050
--What?!
--Lu...

129
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,350
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

130
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,830
Lu...

131
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,730
Your name is Lucy!

132
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,200
Oh yeah, it's Lucy.

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,560
Ouch.

134
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,770
Don't confuse us!

135
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,210
Oh, you're Lucy!

136
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,840
I thought Straw Hat Luffy was here!

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,040
No way!

138
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,460
I heard the real one is
an eight-meter-tall giant!

139
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,680
This is nice!

140
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,900
If you were really...

141
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,640
...Straw Hat Luffy, I would have...

142
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,720
...killed you here and now.

143
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,650
What?

144
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,160
Why?

145
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,360
I entered the New World three years ago.

146
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,070
The whole world was talking
about this beautiful rookie

147
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,930
who was worth over 200 million.

148
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,360
Newspapers covered me everyday.

149
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,940
Girls went nuts over my wanted posters.

150
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,300
They stole all of the
posters throughout a town.

151
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,750
Everybody was going crazy about me.

152
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,510
"Hey, big star!"

153
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,790
"Who? Me?"

154
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,180
"Of course!"

155
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,160
"Cavendish-sama, look at me!"

156
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,740
"Don't worry! I'm always looking at you all!"

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,870
But...

158
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,970
...a year later,

159
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,180
Whitebeard's War of the Best
drew their attention away!

160
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,040
Straw Hat Luffy came into the public spotlight
along with Whitebeard!

161
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,920
On top of that,

162
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,020
new rookies kept coming up one after another

163
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,260
and became popular as the Worst Generation

164
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,930
and wreaked havoc like crazy!

165
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,430
Reporters don't pay attention to me anymore!

166
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,300
That's why I'm gonna kill them!
Those annoying newcomers!

167
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,840
All of them!

168
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,510
What you're saying is absurd.

169
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,840
Say whatever you like!

170
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,210
To recapture everybody's heart,

171
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,850
I would kill as many newcomers as it takes!

172
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,450
To do so, I'm gonna win the
Flare-Flare Fruit today!

173
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,420
Your weight is okay now.

174
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,550
Great!

175
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,760
Hey, you can't ignore me like that!

176
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,570
Dammit! I'm gonna win the
Flare-Flare Fruit at any cost!

177
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,360
Are you a competitor?

178
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,490
You don't look strong but you're cute!

179
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,290
Damn, she's not very friendly.

180
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,570
Don't mess with her too much.

181
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,560
Why?

182
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,310
Don't you know?

183
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,020
Hmmm... How interesting.

184
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,330
I ended up looking like this old man.

185
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,300
Are you interested in that guy?

186
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,300
Who are you?

187
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,370
I'm Rebecca. A gladiator.

188
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,320
REBECCA
A GLADIATOR OF THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

189
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,140
Thank you for what you did earlier.

190
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,340
I didn't like Spartan.

191
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,210
Ah, don't mention it.

192
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,710
This man was a legend.

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,580
A legend? This old man?

194
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,150
He was the strongest
gladiator in the history

195
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,120
of the Corrida Colosseum, named Kyros.

196
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,290
He won 3000 out of 3000 matches.

197
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,000
The only wound he ever
got was a single slash.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
Wow! He was that strong?!

199
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,820
He used to fight here until 20 years ago.

200
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,040
But no one in this country knows about him.

201
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,710
Huh? What do you mean?

202
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,430
None of elders or gladiators in this country
has ever seen him.

203
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,910
It's the strangest statue in Dressrosa.

204
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,190
We don't know if Kyros the
Gladiator actually existed

205
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,790
or somebody made up the story.

206
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,220
And when and why they built this statue here.

207
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,990
All we know is
what's written on this plate right here.

208
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,870
Although nobody knows about him,

209
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,500
nobody wants to remove it.

210
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,030
That's strange, too.

211
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,360
Hmmm... It's so mysterious but...

212
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,290
...I like this statue! It's so manly!

213
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
I like it, too.

214
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,890
Hey, great warrior - Rebecca-chan!

215
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,710
An undefeated girl!
We know you'll do it today, too!

216
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm sure you were happy earlier!

217
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,700
To see Spartan who bullied you for
a long time got his ass kicked.

218
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,110
Stop it, idiot! Let's go!

219
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,430
Everybody's looking forward
to see you get beat!

220
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,570
What's wrong with them?

221
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,550
Don't pay attention to them.

222
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,560
I...

223
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,770
I'm gonna fight for the last time today.

224
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,440
I'm gonna win the Flare-Flare Fruit and...

225
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,550
...kill Doflamingo!

226
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,250
What?! Mingo?!

227
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,230
What block are you in?

228
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,290
C.

229
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,420
Great. I'm in D.

230
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,590
I hope we both survive the first round.

231
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,560
Lucy.

232
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,090
That guy is so strong!

233
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,930
Happy Store!

234
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,980
He's overwhelmingly strong!
The man with a paper bag mask!

235
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,480
Mr. Store!

236
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,600
I wonder if anyone can defeat him!

237
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,540
Hey, there is an extraordinary
guy in Block A!

238
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,210
Huh? What? Who?

239
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,850
I'm not gonna lose here!

240
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,580
I don't think he can't get away now!

241
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,550
Happy Store!

242
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,920
The winner of Block A is the masked man!

243
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,820
Mr. Store!

244
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,530
It was so fast!

245
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,900
We got the new hero in the Colosseum!

246
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,670
Oh? Is he going to take his mask off?!
For real?!

247
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,350
He took it off!

248
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,700
What?!

249
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,650
He's...

250
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,030
I can't believe this! We all know him!

251
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,240
What an interesting beginning!
And an unexpected competitor!

252
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,090
The battle royal of Block
A - the winner is...

253
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,040
Oh, he's...

254
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,680
The winner of Block A is...

255
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,080
...the captain of the first ship of
the fearful Emperor Blackbeard's group -

256
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,630
Jesus Burgess!

257
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,340
He's...

258
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,850
The champion I met that time!

259
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,190
I'm the Fighting Champion.

260
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,160
The Blackbeard Pirates?!

261
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,450
Why is such a guy fighting here?!

262
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,090
I can't believe it was Burgess!

263
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,920
No wonder he was so formidable!

264
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,100
This is exciting! Go, Burgess!

265
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,750
Burgess! Burgess! Burgess! Burgess!

266
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,280
The Blackbeard Pirates, huh?

267
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,490
I was expecting
Luffy will win this thing pretty easily

268
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,830
but maybe it's gonna be tough.

269
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,450
I hope no one finds out who he is.

270
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,980
Now, I've got work to do.

271
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,280
Hey! Wait a minute!

272
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,810
I'll come with you!

273
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,850
What?! Go away!

274
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,020
Can we talk a little bit?

275
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,560
I don't have time to waste!

276
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,030
Wait!

277
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,550
You fool! That's enough!

278
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,600
I don't need a guy who doesn't
know where the factory is!

279
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,380
I'm gonna beat the hell out of

280
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,170
some high-ranked guy in the Doflamingo Family...

281
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,350
--...and make him cough up where it is...
--Whoa-whoa! Wait! Be quiet!

282
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,490
What?!

283
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,320
Peeking, peeking... Peeking, peeking...

284
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,890
Let's go some place else!

285
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,620
You shouldn't say such a radical thing here!

286
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,860
Who the hell are you?

287
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,570
Medical team! Give aid to
the injured of Block A.

288
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,420
"Pirate Mercenary" Hajrudin! Cavendish!

289
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,180
And "The Missionary" Gambia?!

290
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,760
Let's go!

291
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,740
Hey hey, you don't have to rush like that.

292
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,440
Yeah, there are a bunch of bad eggs.

293
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,180
It's gonna be big trouble if one of
these guys wins the Flare-Flare Fruit!

294
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,160
I was surprised about Burgess, too.

295
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,180
I'll talk to Issho-san right away.

296
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,110
Okay.

297
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,450
Hey hey!

298
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,160
Young man, are you talking to yourself?!

299
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,740
You were talking to somebody

300
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,320
A STAFF OFFICER OF A PIRATE GROUP
- THE BARTO CLUB - BOUNTY: 67 MILLION BERRIES

301
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,330
out there, weren't you?

302
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,220
You're fishy!

303
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,490
"THE MISSIONARY" GAMBIA

304
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,540
Am I right? Am I right?

305
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,380
What's that note?!

306
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,410
You were whispering those cool guys' names!

307
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,250
"The Missionary" Gambia. That's... me!

308
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,790
What are you up to?

309
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,960
You can't say?!

310
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,760
Don't tell me you're a Navy soldier...

311
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,580
Are you all right, sir? Please respond.

312
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,870
Everything's fine.

313
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,130
I'll call you back in ten minutes.

314
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,370
Roger that.

315
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:50,990
Clank.

316
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,390
You don't wanna put your nose in any further.

317
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,320
(I won't!)

318
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,000
"The Missionary" Gambia.

319
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,660
Go away.

320
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,990
That bastard!

321
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm scared! Th-That beast is gonna kill me!

322
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,170
Come to yourself! It's over!
You're okay now!

323
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,790
The Colosseum is still excited
from the battle of Block A!

324
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,900
I wonder how it's going to be for Block B!

325
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,150
Shall we go?

326
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,630
There are so many familiar
names, aren't there?

327
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,760
What should we do now?

328
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,600
Oh, your coat.

329
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,020
Here. Are you okay?

330
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,190
Uh-huh!

331
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,060
Thank you, mister!

332
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,310
You're welcome!

333
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,030
Issho-san, here is your coat.

334
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,670
Oh, thank you.

335
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,060
Shall we?

336
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,050
We need, maybe, three Navy ships.

337
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,540
And in the meantime, let's head for... um...

338
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,550
AN ADMIRAL OF THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS

339
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,410
What was the name?

340
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,850
It's Green Bit.

341
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,200
FUJITORA (ISSHO)

342
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,970
Yes, let's go there.

343
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,200
And um...

344
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,480
We need as many medics as possible.

345
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,580
Just in case, we have casualties.

346
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,480
Yes, sir.

347
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,370
I also want to know how many spectators
there are in the Colosseum

348
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,680
and the population of this town.

349
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,630
Okay... Instead of the enemy numbers?

350
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,720
Is it necessary?

351
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:26,080
What we have to consider first is
not the number of enemies...

352
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,140
...but the number of people we have to protect -
don't you think so?

353
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,660
Yes, sir!

354
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,740
All Navy soldiers in Dressrosa!

355
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,480
We're gonna head for Green Bit now!

356
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,780
Meet us in front of the Colosseum!

357
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,220
Under command of the Admiral,
we put our plan...

358
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,350
...into action!

359
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,280
This is Maynard.

360
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,300
Excuse me for hanging up earlier.

361
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,300
Everything is okay here.

362
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,440
Oh, and earlier, I mentioned a name -
"The Missionary" Gambia...

363
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,160
...who works under Bartolomeo.

364
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,730
No. 0429 - CAPMAN

365
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,740
But you can cross it out.

366
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,330
It wasn't him that I saw after all.

367
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,980
D-Damn! That Navy soldier...

368
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,040
A VICE ADMIRAL OF THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS
"MAYNARD THE PURSUER"

369
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,140
I'll keep going on with the plan here, too.

370
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,360
The medical room is that way!

371
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,010
We don't have enough stretchers.
Walk by yourself if you can!

372
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,280
They got beaten badly by the champion.

373
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,780
Hey.

374
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,460
I'm not blind.

375
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,200
No matter how you disguise yourself,

376
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,900
I can't help recognizing the face of the guy...

377
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,190
...who put a blot on my record!

378
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,610
You!
