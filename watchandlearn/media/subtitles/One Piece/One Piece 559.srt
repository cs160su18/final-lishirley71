00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

your toughness, that’s what it takes

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,880
Being brazen, is it a crime?

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

It’s important not to wake up

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

The sun of my heart will never set

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,340
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,930
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,770
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,980
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,140
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,950
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,460
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil

80
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,670
and involved in an all-out war!

81
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:06,390
If I am the only one who you want to kill,
please do not harm the other people...

82
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,680
...of the Ryugu Kingdom!

83
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,310
Come and get me!

84
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,920
Damn Yowahoshi! I told her to stick with me!

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,510
Don't mess with me, Vander Decken!

86
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,400
But I like this idea!

87
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,610
I'll be counting on you to save
my beloved Shirahoshi-chan!

88
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,330
You ready, Luffy?!

89
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,590
Go ahead!

90
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:25,340
"Hurry up, Luffy! Shirahoshi's
Life in Jeopardy!"

91
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,990
Th-The Noah is...

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,080
The Noah is turning away. It's
not gonna crash into the island!

93
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,550
Princess-sama saved us
by drawing the ship away!

94
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,220
--Princess Shirahoshi!
--Please escape!

95
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,430
Where are you going, Shirahoshi?
There's no way for you to run!

96
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,400
Shirahoshi!

97
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,360
I have to go out to the sea in order
to keep the Noah away from the bubble!

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,080
The bubble can't take any more damage!

99
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,710
But the main entrance is too far from here.

100
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,980
If I am correct, Luffy-sama's friends were
the last ones who left the Ryugu Palace.

101
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,560
Then maybe the gateway is still open.

102
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,280
Damn! Isn't there anything that we can do!

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,010
Our princess is risking
her life to save us all!

104
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,990
It's not her fault that Decken is after her!

105
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,440
Not only is Decken on that ship but now
Hordy is climbing aboard one of the chains!

106
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,500
Princess Shirahoshi's life is in danger!

107
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,260
He betrayed me, that lunatic - Decken!

108
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,180
But he can still be useful.

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,600
Be careful for Hordy, Luffy!

110
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,480
Fish-Men are way stronger
than humans in the water!

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,690
Got it!

112
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,760
I can't let him pierce the
bubble and go out to sea.

113
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,110
I have to do it carefully -
not too strong, not too weak.

114
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,950
Sanji!

115
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,080
Armee de L'Air Assault...

116
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,010
...Gum Shoot!

117
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,980
What a big chain!

118
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,730
Am I in between the bubbles?

119
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,150
Hordy! He's still under the bubble.

120
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,870
Pull! Pull!

121
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,710
We don't have stop it! We only have
to slow it down a little bit...

122
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,630
...before it catches up with Princess-sama!

123
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,300
--Pull!
--Don't let the Noah go any farther!

124
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,180
Princess-sama! Get somewhere safe
while we're slowing it down!

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,430
Damn! Stop!

126
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,390
Those fools!

127
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,940
Everybody!

128
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,760
They must be out of their minds!

129
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,360
They can't move it even a millimeter!
How senseless is that?!

130
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,150
What?

131
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,980
Hey, quit it!

132
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,280
Shark Arrows!

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,400
Worthless scum!

134
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,420
Because of cowards like you guys, humans
think they can make fools of Fish-Men!

135
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,130
Your lives mean nothing to me!

136
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,480
People like you just keep bringing
shame to Fish-Men. Drop dead already!

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,490
Everybody...

138
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,780
That bastard!

139
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,450
Princess-sama, escape! H-Hurry...

140
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,500
I have to keep going!

141
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,880
I was right! The entrance
to the palace was left open!

142
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,890
Hey, stay with me! Damn Hordy!

143
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,200
Princess Shirahoshi is going...

144
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,400
...out to sea through the gateway!

145
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,150
--The Noah is going after her!
--Princess-sama, go farther!

146
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,080
Oh, it's going up!

147
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

148
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,720
Oh no, the chain!

149
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,890
How inconvenient it must be to be a human!

150
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,310
You all act so tough on the ground

151
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,900
but you couldn't even win a fight
with a Fish-Man child in the sea!

152
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,860
That's how weak you are!

153
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,720
I'll make you regret standing against me!

154
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,790
Hordy!

155
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,930
Where do you think you are?!

156
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,540
You're not on the ground!

157
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,080
Humans become powerless in the water

158
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,290
but for a Fish-Man like me, this is where I

159
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,780
can use my true ability to the full extent!

160
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,920
It was very fortunate for me
that Shirahoshi went out to sea!

161
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,960
Shark Arrows!

162
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,620
Devil Fruit eaters fare no better than
ordinary people in the water.

163
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,010
Maybe worse.

164
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,960
Isn't it ironic, Straw Hat?

165
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,890
Pathetic and powerless!
That's how you truly are!

166
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,740
No matter how big you talk!

167
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,580
You humans can't even breathe in the water...

168
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,870
Straw Hat, a piece of trash like you
will never become the ruler of the sea!

169
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,960
You ought to regret what
you did and beg for mercy!

170
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,970
You can't even do that now, can
you? You pathetic, lowly creature!

171
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,930
Rot in hell, Straw Hat!

172
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,690
Damn you!

173
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,100
Are you okay, Straw Hat?

174
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,540
B-Brother-hoshi!

175
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,460
That stupid hanger-on -
what a useless gesture.

176
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,920
You can't get away from me, Straw Hat!

177
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,080
Pull! Pull!

178
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,920
We don't have stop it! We only have
to slow it down a little bit...

179
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,590
...before it catches up with Princess-sama!

180
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,340
--Pull!
--Don't let the Noah go any further!

181
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,550
Princess-sama! Get somewhere safe
while we're slowing it down!

182
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,630
I-In order to save the people
of the Ryugu Kingdom,

183
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,770
I have to draw the Noah
away from the island...

184
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,360
...as far as possible!

185
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,370
Shirahoshi!

186
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,300
How do you like your freedom?

187
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,860
You no longer have those
walls of the Hard Shell

188
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,410
Tower that were protecting
you for last 10 years!

189
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,580
You have a choice of bleeding to death

190
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,510
or being crushed by the giant ship - Noah!

191
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,800
I'll give you one last chance, Shirahoshi!

192
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,130
If you say "Yes," I'll spare your life!

193
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,850
Have mercy, Decken-sama!

194
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,100
Marry me!

195
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,480
You're not my type!

196
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,550
Gee...

197
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,620
All right...

198
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,210
Then go to hell!

199
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:47,750
Drop dead and live in my heart forever!

200
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,220
As my beloved wife!

201
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,510
Now!

202
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,570
We're not gonna let her marry a guy like you!

203
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,930
She's our only baby sister! We're
not gonna let you hurt her, Decken!

204
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,130
Brother Mamboshi-sama! Brother
Ryuboshi-sama! Hoe-sama!

205
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,490
Brothers-sama!

206
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,760
We're not your brothers!

207
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,080
Brothers-sama! Some people at the
plaza tried to save me and...

208
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,630
Shirahoshi! Don't cry now!

209
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,820
No! Brother-sama got mad...

210
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,340
I'm not mad!

211
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:40,310
According to Father, we can't even
let the ship get damaged-la-ti-do!

212
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,570
So we have to return it to the seafloor
without letting it hit anything!

213
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,150
Here it comes!

214
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,680
Oh no! In any case, you shouldn't swim
near undersea mountains or trenches!

215
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,610
The Noah will get damaged!

216
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,840
Then where should I go,
Brother Mamboshi-sama?!

217
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,750
Go up! There are too many
obstacles down here!

218
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,580
Okay!

219
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,590
We'll go beat Decken!

220
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:26,850
You will never get away from the Noah
and my unending love, Shirahoshi!

221
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,460
Thank you for saving me!

222
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,660
You got hurt before - are you okay?

223
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,240
Members of the royal family, soldiers,
citizens... all of them got hurt or died.

224
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,090
And even Shirahoshi is trying so hard
to save the Ryugu Kingdom while injured!

225
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,590
So this is not the time for me to
suffer from such minor injuries!

226
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,110
I need to ask you a favor.

227
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,420
Maybe not now.

228
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,020
The Merfolk are the greatest
swimmers in the world!

229
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,770
But to me, they look like stop motion!

230
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,150
That bastard!

231
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,610
Shark Slicer!

232
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,170
We're dead once it hits us!

233
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,050
Should I chop both of you up and
feed you to the little fishes?

234
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,220
The pirate with a 400 million bounty
and the prince of the Ryugu Kingdom.

235
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,360
What exquisite food for them!

236
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,100
He's coming!

237
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,360
Although his power is phony, he's fast!

238
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,520
Hang on tight!

239
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,350
He's pretty strong in the
sea! Almost like Zoro!

240
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,190
You're not supposed to be
impressed at a time like this!

241
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,820
No matter where you go, you can't get
away from the Shark Slicer's blade!

242
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,040
Is he trying to escape in the cloud of dust?

243
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,260
The Noah is...

244
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,060
Shirahoshi!

245
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,900
--Shirahoshi!
--Hey, go to the deck of the ship!

246
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,190
Damn Decken!

247
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,490
Is that what you wanted to
ask me before? But why there?

248
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,120
Because of what Jimbei told me.

249
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,150
Do you think the ship is
filled with water, Jimbei?

250
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,580
I don't know but I know Decken
is a Devil Fruit eater.

251
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,000
Which means there must be air for him!

252
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,530
It'll be easier for me to fight there.

253
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,990
I wanna kick the crap out of Hordy
and the guy who throws things!

254
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,980
I promised Yowahoshi when we left the
tower, that I was gonna protect her!

255
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,270
Speaking of promises...

256
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,330
We three will become great
warriors like our father...

257
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,740
...and protect Shirahoshi with
our lives as we promised!

258
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,140
I have a promise to keep too!

259
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,680
We were defeated by that cheap
hoodlum who relies on some

260
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,150
fake power from the Energy Steroid!

261
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,440
What a shame!

262
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,570
I'm sorry that we suspected you...

263
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,040
Don't mention it. Take me to the deck!

264
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,380
You wanna go to the deck?

265
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,260
Hordy!

266
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,620
I can take care of Straw Hat anytime.

267
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,390
But there is something that
needs to be done right now.

268
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,380
--Go after him already!
--No, wait, Straw Hat!

269
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,020
Why?!

270
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,650
I'm sure you know it by now.

271
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,100
Hordy has an advantage in the
water since he is a Fish-Man.

272
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,530
--If nothing is done...
--What should we do?

273
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,530
I have an idea!

274
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,240
Go up! Go up!

275
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,400
Like I said, it's no use, Shirahoshi!

276
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,360
As long as my Mark-Mark Curse is in effect,

277
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,180
there is no way for you
to get away from the Noah!

278
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,160
Oh, Hordy Jones!

279
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,890
What happened to Neptune? Did you kill him?

280
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,670
I'm tormenting Shirahoshi with the Noah now.

281
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,240
Don't you think it's a good idea?

282
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
Huh, Bro?!

283
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,170
I have a good idea too!

284
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,080
What is it? Let me hear it.

285
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,670
If you die now...

286
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,570
What'll happen to this ship?

287
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,990
Decken!

288
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,540
Hordy suddenly attacks Decken.

289
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,340
His terrifying plan was to
destroy Fish-Man Island!

290
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:36,110
Hordy then attacks Shirahoshi
to complete his ambition!

291
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,230
But then, Luffy's new attack
is unleashed on Hordy!

292
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,760
On the next episode of One Piece!

293
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,650
"The Fierce Fight Begins! Luffy vs. Hordy!"

294
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,830
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
