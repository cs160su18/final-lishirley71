2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,080
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,550
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,410
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,630
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,480
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,650
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,780
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,490
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,290
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,630
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,820
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,420
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the Grand
Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,210
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,100
After Luffy and friends set out
in search of a coating craftsman,

48
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,270
Camie was kidnapped at Sabaody Park.

49
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,020
...Some guy brought in a mermaid
just before the auctions started!

50
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,900
H-Hold on! Who was this guy?!

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,900
After learning that she had already been
taken to the auction house on Grove #1...

52
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,160
...Nami and company were the first to arrive.

53
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,290
And, while the auctioning continued,

54
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,020
Luffy and four others had yet
to reach the auction house!

55
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,170
We will save you! Hang on, Camie!

56
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,220
"The Fist Explodes! Destroy the Auction"

57
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,640
Entry #15! The beautiful dancer, Pashia!

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,950
Incredibly, her starting
price of 800,000 Berries

59
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,740
has rocketed to the sky-high
price of 7.2 million Berries!

60
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,310
I'm finally here...

61
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,890
Okay! Now that things are
starting to getting fired up,

62
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,610
what do you say to this
next piece of merchandise?!

63
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,890
What a relief! It's still going on!

64
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,130
However, I heard him say
"Entry #15" just now,

65
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,910
so I believe it's almost over.

66
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,150
This thing really annoys me to no end!

67
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,030
Take this! And this!

68
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,990
Hey. Go sell this one too, while
we're here. I don't need it anymore.

69
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,870
I will make arrangements at once.

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,880
A Celestial Dragon...

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,860
Another World Noble is here...

72
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,260
Defy them and a navy admiral
will come running, huh...

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,160
I want a mermaid. I hope
they have one this time.

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,530
Merfolk are apparently a
rather hard species to catch,

75
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,730
so I'm unsure if one will be up
for auction this time or not...

76
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,330
Wh-What a pleasant surprise, Saint Charloss!

77
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,590
Take me to my seat already.

78
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,930
Yes, right away!

79
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,580
Please watch your step!

80
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,130
Brother Charloss is finally here.

81
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,600
Hey! Get walkin'!

82
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,570
Okay! It looks like we're ready to continue!

83
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:30,780
Entry #16 is none other than
the captain of a pirate ship!

84
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,570
A captain?

85
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,060
Feast your eyes on this man, with
a bounty of 17 million Berries!

86
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,760
Goes by the name of Lacuba!

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,260
He's known as a tactful strategist,

88
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,530
but his well-trained body
is another great attribute!

89
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,000
You can use him as a horse, for heavy
physical labor, or as a punching bag!

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,720
He has many uses, indeed!

91
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,920
Now, then!

92
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,570
Bastard! Don't tell me you just--!

93
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,510
He collapsed!

94
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,790
What happened?!

95
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,110
I saw blood!

96
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,220
Hey! Shut the curtains!

97
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,980
What happened?!

98
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,370
What just happened?

99
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,150
He bit his tongue off.

100
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,970
He decided he'd rather die here

101
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,000
than live a wretched life as someone's pet.

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,940
In some cases, that could
be the smart choice.

103
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,160
Camie...

104
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,780
Where's the mermaid already?!

105
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,700
Camie must be so scared...

106
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,370
Just hang on a little longer!

107
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,090
We will save her!

108
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,250
Good thing we have that
treasure from Thriller Bark!

109
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,420
Thank you so much, you guys...

110
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,830
No good.

111
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,470
Damn! I'm not gonna make any
money off of you now, you idiot!

112
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,720
Disco-san!

113
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,770
A doctor's on the way!

114
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,670
Geez! Do you know how much it's
gonna cost to treat you now?!

115
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,180
The mermaid's next, right?!

116
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Yes! Everything's all set!
It can go on at any time!

117
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,150
Good!

118
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,990
This super big-event item should blast
away the chilly mood in the air!

119
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,580
Bring her out now, men!

120
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,410
Right!

121
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,870
Hatchin... Everyone...

122
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,240
#13? Didn't I pass by #2 just now?

123
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,810
Must be my imagination.

124
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,560
That man had so much bloodlust...

125
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,840
Pirate Hunter Zoro... He ain't
worth 120 million for nothin'!

126
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,610
Get mixed up with him and you won't survive,

127
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,150
no matter how many lives you have!

128
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,150
I never wanna meet that guy
again, that's for sure...

129
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,080
Hey! Hold it!

130
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,820
Aren't you guys...

131
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,220
What brings you here again?

132
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,580
You guys gave me fake
directions, didn't you?!

133
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,540
Nothing of the sort! We gave you
genuine directions to Grove #1!

134
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,260
Then why'd you run away?!

135
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,020
B-Because you glared at us
with such a vicious look!

136
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,410
Huh?!

137
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,150
Zoro!

138
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,490
We gotta hurry to Grove #1! Just get on!

139
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,820
Hold on! Not this again...!

140
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,930
"Aaaaaaaah"

141
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,980
What are you doing?!

142
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,970
Oops...

143
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,930
Someday I'm gonna cut you in two...

144
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,950
Sorry, Zoro.

145
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,880
Let's hurry to Grove #1!

146
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:27,730
#16, pirate Lacuba, was extremely nervous
and collapsed after a nosebleed,

147
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,060
so his introduction will have
to wait for another day.

148
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,930
Nervous?

149
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,570
What crap...

150
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,730
But, ladies and gentlemen!

151
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,900
The next item I have for you is a
super-incredible piece of merchandise

152
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,530
sure to instantly blow all this trouble away!

153
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,480
A highly sought after item, to be sure!

154
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,730
Observe this silhouette!

155
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,310
Oh! Could it be?!

156
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,240
Yes! An incredible item!

157
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,850
I won't say much. Look upon
it with your own eyes!

158
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,120
Now for the moment you've been waiting for!

159
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,090
It's time for the unveiling!
Take a good look!

160
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,350
All the way from Fish-Man
Island, the mermaid Camie!

161
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,350
It's real! A young mermaid!

162
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,840
Amazing!

163
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,980
What a find!

164
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,910
It's Hatchin and the others!
They came to rescue me!

165
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,950
Camie!

166
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,690
They're selling Camie now!

167
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,770
Alright! We're gonna get her
back! We have 200 million here!

168
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,170
Camie!

169
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,210
Hooray! A mermaid! They're selling a mermaid!

170
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,060
I see that there's immense interest
in this, our first mermaid in a while!

171
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,270
Now, then! How much shall we start from?

172
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's make the first move to
win! We will get her back!

173
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,530
All right, then! Let's begin!

174
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,410
Bidding will start at...

175
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,390
500 million!

176
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,830
I'll buy it for 500 million Berries!

177
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,240
500 million...?

178
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,160
It's no good. We can't compete with him.

179
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,790
How could that happen so suddenly?!
We don't even have close to that much!

180
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,810
What another waste of money. You have
piranhas in your aquarium, you know.

181
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,530
I'm going to have them chase her for fun.

182
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,260
Merfolk are the fastest
swimmers in the world!

183
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,630
I can't hear what they're saying outside...

184
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,270
Help me get out of here, Hatchin!

185
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,190
Camie...

186
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,770
Is she gonna get sold to a Celestial
Dragon while we stand here, helpless?!

187
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,860
Camie...!

188
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,600
Everyone seems to be at a loss for
words, but I'll ask just the same.

189
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,730
Are there any bids higher than 500 million?

190
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,060
Can't we do something about this?!
Isn't there anything we can do?!

191
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,470
Isn't there, Sanji?!

192
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,170
Nami!

193
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,330
We can't let this happen!

194
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,540
We can't let our friend get
bought and taken away like this!

195
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,560
This is bad... I never even
imagined this happening.

196
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,930
We stepped back, thinking money
could solve this problem,

197
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,510
but things've just gotten worse!

198
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,640
If not, then that'll bring
bidding straight to a close!

199
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,120
I'll just have to help her
escape into the ocean by force!

200
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,310
Don't be stupid! What about that
collar?! It'll make Camie blow up!

201
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,690
Then... we'll have to get the
key to the collar somehow!

202
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,000
Time is up!

203
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,960
I did it!

204
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,690
It's almost like a miniature
version of the world.

205
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,300
What a pathetic farce. Let's go.

206
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,460
The bidding has ended!

207
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,840
Today's super showcase
item, the mermaid Camie...

208
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,060
...goes to the World Noble,
Saint Charloss for his bid of...

209
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,270
...500 million...

210
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,780
What's that?

211
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,490
...Berries!

212
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,460
What the...?!

213
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,790
How noisy.

214
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,730
Luffy!

215
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,840
What's your problem?! You
can land better than that!

216
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,470
I can't! It's a flying fish!
Besides, you said to run into it!

217
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,050
You told me to "just get on,"

218
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,030
but why're you guys in such a
hurry to get back to the Sunny?!

219
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,010
Where are we, anyway?!

220
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,400
Zoro, too?!

221
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,150
You guys...

222
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,070
That's Straw Hat Luffy...!

223
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,730
Camie!

224
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,290
Who are they?! Where'd they come from?!

225
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,460
Camie!

226
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,540
Luffy-chin!

227
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,570
Camie! We've been looking
everywhere! What a relief!

228
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,530
Hold on, Straw Hat! What are you doing?!

229
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,300
What do you mean?! Camie's right there!

230
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,700
She is, but she's wearing an explosive
collar! We can't take her away!

231
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,730
Plus, there are Celestial
Dragons involved now...!

232
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,850
So what?!

233
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,040
Did he just call him "Straw Hat"?

234
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,400
He's a pirate!

235
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,050
Camie!

236
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,190
Please, stop!

237
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,910
His arms...! His arms...!

238
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,520
He's a fish-man!

239
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,480
Disgusting!

240
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,490
What's a fish-man doing here?!

241
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,090
It's an octopus monster!

242
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,590
I'm coming to save you, Camie!

243
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,800
Seize him!

244
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,430
You guys! Camie isn't for sale!

245
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,070
Keep him away from the stage!

246
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,140
What's a fish-man doing on land?!

247
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,330
Yuck, stay away! Your
very existence is scary!

248
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,390
Hey, staff! Apprehend him already!

249
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,200
Eww! Get away!

250
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,860
Go back to the sea, you freak!

251
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
Yeah!

252
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,500
Get off these islands!

253
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,200
Get out of here!

254
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,660
Hachi! Let's run for now!
You're the one in danger now!

255
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,460
Never mind me! It's Camie who's in trouble!

256
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,490
What the hell's going on here?!

257
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,570
It's exactly like Robin said...

258
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,470
Huh?

259
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,510
They discriminate against fish-men
and merfolk on these islands!

260
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,780
Discriminate..? Against Camie and Hachi?

261
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,940
H-Hachi...

262
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,690
I shot it! I took down a fish-man!

263
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,480
Hachi!

264
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,490
Thank heavens someone shot him.

265
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,760
It would've been terrible if it'd come
close enough to spread its diseases!

266
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,580
It was definitely plotting something.

267
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,290
But even if it can walk upright,
it still has a fish's brain!

268
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,640
Look, Father! I caught a fish-man!

269
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,650
I caught it myself, so
I can have it for free!

270
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,770
Free! Free! An octopus for free!

271
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,790
What a deal! What a deal! An
octopus slave for free! Free!

272
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,860
Free, free, free!

273
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,770
W-

274
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,070
Wait...

275
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,620
Straw Hat...!

276
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,050
Don't... Don't be mad...

277
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,710
I'm the one... who screwed up...

278
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,730
You promised not to defy
the Celestial Dragons,

279
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,490
even if you saw someone get shot...!

280
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,730
I was a pirate at one time...!

281
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,000
This is what I deserve... for
doing those horrible things...

282
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:16,520
I'm sorry... I didn't mean
for it to be like this...!

283
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:25,140
I just wanted to make amends with
Nami... even if it wasn't much...

284
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,470
So I wanted to be helpful to you guys...

285
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:43,360
But I guess I've always been a
screw-up... no matter what I do...!

286
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,950
I'm a real screw-up...!

287
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,880
Hachi...

288
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,530
All I ever do is cause trouble...

289
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:03,070
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry...!

290
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,770
You lousy fish, still blabbering
on even though I shot you!

291
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,260
You annoy me!

292
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,890
Straw!

293
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,810
What's with that look, you?!

294
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,610
Stop, Straw! You guys'll
get in huge trouble too!

295
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,660
Please, stop!

296
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,970
Do you not see this?!

297
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,670
What's he going to do?!

298
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,880
Straw Hat-ya...?

299
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,550
Is he serious?!

300
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,220
You annoy me, too!

301
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,260
I see it! The auction house!

302
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,450
What is that?!

303
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,620
The Marines have gathered around the auction house!

304
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,980
This could be trouble!

305
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,330
Wait a minute,

306
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,880
Luffy and the others must have started some trouble!

307
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,460
We have to hurry and save them, or they'll be ambushed.

308
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,220
I don't wanna!

309
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,710
On the next episode of One Piece!

310
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,020
"Major Panic! Desperate
Struggle at the Auction House"

311
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,890
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
