00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,480
What a huge town!

22
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,820
The place used to be full of pirates
on their way to the Grand Line.

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,860
I'm gonna go get some equipment!

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,750
Looks like I can get some nice
ingredients in a town this big.

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,580
Nice women, too!

26
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,750
I got something I wanna buy, too.

27
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,450
Oh? How're you gonna do that, Zoro?

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,010
Alright! I'm gonna check
out the execution platform!

29
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,660
Huh?

30
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,920
--Die!
--Yeah!

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,640
--Glasses... Glasses...
--Hey. Are these them?

32
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,770
Sorry to bother you!

33
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,690
Pay me back for those!

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,560
Perfect timing! Do you know how
to get to the execution platform?

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,450
Follow the smoke.

36
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,910
Let's have a toast!
To the Eternal King of the Pirates!

37
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,740
To the Eternal King of the Pirates!

38
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,210
That Straw Hat...

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,840
It was Monkey D. Luffy!

40
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,850
The place where the
greatest pirate in history died...

41
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,830
And the place where
the pirate age began...

42
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,770
I'm gonna see the view the King
of the Pirates saw before he died!

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,490
Alright! Time to go up!

44
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,100
"Kitetsu III and Yubashiri! Zoro's New
Swords and the Woman Sergeant Major"

45
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,860
Captain Smoker!
Where are you going?!

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,740
The execution platform.

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,170
I wanna see the place where
the King of the Pirates died!

48
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,790
He will be there!

49
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,370
You mean the Monkey D. Luffy?!

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,590
We can mobilize
100 men immediately, sir!

51
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,130
And the entire battalion afterward!

52
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,450
You guys just don't get it.

53
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,230
I'm more than enough on my own.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,340
Man, that's dangerous...

55
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,090
Hey.

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,280
Hey, boy.

57
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,160
What do you want?
I'm busy right now!

58
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,830
Are you the guy with the
biggest bounty in the East Blue?

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,180
I'm Luffy. Do you need something?

60
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,640
I'm Captain Smoker of the Navy.
I'm in charge of Loguetown.

61
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,250
You're under arrest.

62
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,780
Huh? Arrest? Forget it!

63
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,310
I'm just about to go into the Grand
Line and be King of the Pirates!

64
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,100
King of the Pirates?

65
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,610
I refuse to get arrested
in a place like this!

66
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,960
Then you'll have to beat me first.

67
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,620
You don't get into the Grand
Line unless you can beat me.

68
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,360
That's the rule of this town.

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,450
That's assuming you're brave
enough to fight me, of course.

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,560
I can't get into the Grand
Line unless I beat you?

71
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,920
Then I'll beat you!

72
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,170
Go ahead and try.

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,130
Gum-Gum...

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,210
He's made out of rubber?!

75
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,220
Darn it! My legs are tangled!

76
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,760
Just what the hell are you doing?!

77
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,990
I'm not doing this 'cause
I wanna! It's my legs...!

78
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm unstuck!

79
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,290
Gum-Gum Pistol!

80
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,020
Too slow!

81
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,450
Someone as pathetic as you,
worth 30 million Berries?

82
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,820
I don't even need to use
my Devil Fruit power.

83
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,900
My fists are more than enough!

84
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,320
Here I come!

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,920
22 years ago, I saw his execution.

86
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,050
His proud final moments were
worthy of the King of the Pirates...

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,920
You, King of the Pirates?
Don't make me laugh!

88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,860
You can't even enter the Grand Line!

89
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,360
There's no point in getting back up.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,940
There's no way to
know that unless I try!

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,410
Here goes! Gum-Gum...

92
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,410
...Whip!

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,160
U-Uh oh!

94
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,010
I really messed that up!

95
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,980
What's with that boy?

96
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,310
There you are,
my beloved mademoiselle!

97
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,430
Huh?

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,300
My damn mistake.
Please come again...

99
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,980
Huh?

100
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,940
Man, was she beautiful...

101
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,100
Thank you!

102
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,000
Sure!

103
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,120
Huh?!

104
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,430
Oh! I'll take this, too!

105
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,380
Thank you, sir!

106
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,260
What are they doing?

107
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,240
I knew it.

108
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,660
The cards say that detestable
runt is already in this town.

109
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,400
The time for revenge
has flashily come at last!

110
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,580
So? Do you successfully take his life?

111
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,270
Obviously.

112
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,860
The one who dies is...

113
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,830
Oh. It's you!

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,870
Bonk!

115
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,380
Captain! W-We just saw--!

116
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,910
I sure flew a long way...

117
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,770
What was with that guy?

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,230
Now what do I do?

119
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,240
Guess I'll sleep for now!

120
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,980
Hey, are you okay?

121
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,410
Do you suppose he's dead?

122
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,580
You think?

123
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,050
Where exactly are we going?!

124
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,050
You broke my glasses.

125
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,050
I told you.
I'll pay you back... somehow.

126
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,280
You don't look like you
would have any money!

127
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,300
Something about you just seems off!

128
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,970
T-True, I don't have any money, but...

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,830
Those wrinkles between your eyes!

130
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,520
That look of having
eaten nothing for days!

131
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,410
Do you have a sick mother?!

132
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,210
Did your wife run out on you and
leave you with five babies to nurse?!

133
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,000
L-Look, you!

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,660
I won't ask for details!
Just come with me!

135
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,840
T-The navy?

136
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,630
Here.

137
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,590
The cleaning man just quit his job.

138
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,050
If you work for the navy, you'll
never need to worry about money!

139
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,360
You're a very lucky person!

140
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,260
Screw that! Why should
I work for the navy?!

141
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,330
You're just going to run off?!
You're insulting a person's kindness!

142
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,230
Maybe your poor spirit's more of
an issue than your money problem?!

143
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,200
Look, you!

144
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,010
Sergeant Major! It's time for training!

145
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,850
Bye! Please work hard, okay?

146
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,810
Sergeant Major?!

147
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,860
I bought a lot!
Maybe I'll hit another store!

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,690
The navy?

149
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,020
Dammit, how'd I get stuck doing this?!

150
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,210
Zoro's... working for the navy?

151
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,230
Just pretend you didn't see anything...

152
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,850
Damn it!
I'm gettin' nowhere like this!

153
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,360
Guess even three brushes is best!

154
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,420
Let me try again!

155
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,880
You! What are you doing here?!

156
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,680
I knew it! You are Pirate Hunter Zoro!

157
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,890
Why the hell are you in here cleaning?!

158
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,680
Intel has it you've teamed up
with Monkey D. Luffy's crew!

159
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,650
You're under arrest!

160
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,880
Well... now what?

161
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,520
What happened here?!

162
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,740
It seems someone attacked them!
There's no trace of whoever did it!

163
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,370
"For your glasses."

164
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,620
Man, that freaked me out...

165
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,960
Dammit! She looks
way too much like Kuina!

166
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,840
Not to mention she's
a swordsman, of all things...

167
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,900
The world sure is a big place.
But I doubt I'll ever see her again.

168
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,580
I'd like some swords.

169
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,880
Yes, yes! Welcome!
Have a look at anything you'd like!

170
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,550
Our shop's been in business
for 200 years, you see!

171
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,660
I got 100,000 Berries.
Sell me two swords.

172
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,300
Eh? Two swords for 100,000 Berries?

173
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,520
Damn, he has no money.

174
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,980
50,000 a sword'll only
get you some dull blades.

175
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,490
I'll make do with whatever.
I just don't got any money.

176
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,720
You'll make do with whatever?
Hmph! What an amateur!

177
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,240
That sword on his waist!
Could it be?!

178
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,850
O-Oh, h-h-hold on.

179
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,770
L-L-Lemme see that sword of y-y-yours!

180
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,000
What're you all fidgety for?!

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,470
J-Just let me see it!

182
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,760
Weirdo.

183
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,090
T-This really is it!

184
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,770
C-Calm down! This is your chance!

185
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,500
An absolute amateur waltzed
right in here with a legendary sword!

186
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,820
You need to act cool!

187
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,480
Wow, that's not a bad sword!

188
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,070
What do you say? I'll buy this
from you for 200,000 Berries.

189
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,410
Then you'll have 300,000 Berries total!

190
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,780
You could get three good
swords at 100,000 apiece!

191
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,020
Huh?! What're you talking about?!

192
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,210
A-Alright! I-I can make it
250,000! No, 300,000!

193
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,730
500,000?

194
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,040
Look. Raise the price all
you want, this sword isn't--

195
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,880
Alright, then! I'll buy it
from you for 650,000 Berries!

196
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,620
Fine, you damn professional!

197
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,890
How does 800,000 Berries sound?!

198
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,570
Hello!

199
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,300
Did you finish polishing my Shigure?

200
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,520
Thank goodness! You're all right!

201
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,480
Someone went on a rampage
at the navy outpost earlier.

202
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,820
You were gone too, so I was worried!

203
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,080
--She's a royal-class dimwit...
--Thank goodness! What a relief...

204
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,620
But the fact that you're
here safe and sound...

205
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,920
...means you actually scoffed
at my kindness and ran off!

206
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,640
Here's your money back.

207
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,970
I can't accept money from
someone who's heartless.

208
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,180
Besides, I bought some new glasses!

209
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,760
Is this sword the Wado Ichimonji?!

210
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,770
It is the Wado Ichimonji!

211
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,360
Wado?!

212
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,100
Don't say it! Don't say it!

213
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,770
What a beautiful straight temper line!

214
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,740
I believe it's one of the 21
O-Wazamono swords!

215
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,620
See! Look at this! It's worth
no less than 10 million Berries!

216
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,530
But what are you doing
with such a legendary sword?

217
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,770
Curse you! You just
had to blurt it all out!

218
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,860
I'm suing for obstruction of business!

219
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,710
O-Obstruction of business?

220
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,010
I'm sorry! Did I say something wrong?

221
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,550
You're here for your Shigure,
right?! I'm done polishing it!

222
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,930
Take it and get the hell out!

223
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,090
Why did you run straight into those?!

224
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,360
I-I'm sorry.

225
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,260
That dumb girl saved you!

226
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,200
It's true, that sword's
so legendary it'd be a waste

227
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,030
for a guy who doesn't know
its value to walk around with it.

228
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,940
All the swords in that barrel
are 50,000 Berries apiece!

229
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,990
Just take whatever two you want!

230
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,500
What's he so mad about?

231
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,040
You must really like swords,
carrying three of them around!

232
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,210
That's almost like this one
bounty hunter out there!

233
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,020
Bounty hunter, huh?

234
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,640
He's famous! His name is Roronoa!

235
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,930
I hear the name a lot.

236
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,840
Yes. He's a famous swordsman
all throughout the East Blue,

237
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,560
but he's a notorious person!

238
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,060
Using swords as bounty-hunting
tools is unforgivable!

239
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,690
Why is evil so strong in this era?

240
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,890
All the famous sword masters
are pirates or bounty hunters...

241
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,730
And almost all of the world's
legendary swords are in their hands.

242
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,530
It's a real shame...

243
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
I dunno, maybe everyone has
their own circumstances and stuff?

244
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,210
All jobs need to keep up
with the times somehow.

245
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,160
In any case, with my Shigure,

246
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,560
I'm going to polish
my skills as a swordsman

247
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,950
and someday gather
all the legendary swords

248
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,940
that are in the hands of
criminals throughout the world!

249
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,820
The 21 Top O-Wazamonos,
the 21 O-Wazamonos,

250
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,630
and the 50 Ryo-Wazamonos...

251
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,220
I'll risk my life for them!

252
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,890
You gonna take this sword, too?
The Wado Ichimonji, was it?

253
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,860
No, it's not that I want
legendary swords...

254
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,820
I'm just saying I don't like
them being in criminals' hands!

255
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,700
This sword...

256
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,170
That sword! I think it's...

257
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,200
I thought so! Kitetsu III!

258
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,540
It's the Kitetsu III!

259
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,640
Its predecessor, the Kitetsu II,
is an O-Wazamono sword,

260
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,280
and the Kitetsu I before that is
listed as a Top O-Wazamono sword!

261
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,330
Mister! Is this sword
really 50,000 Berries?!

262
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,470
Y-Yeah...

263
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,190
Incredible! It's a respectable
Wazamono, you know!

264
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,400
That one! You have to choose that one!

265
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,860
It normally goes for one million Berries!

266
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,790
You absolutely have to choose it!

267
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,200
N-No! I can't sell it!

268
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,990
Yeah! Selling this for
50,000 Berries is clearly strange!

269
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,120
No, that's not what I mean!

270
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,510
A cursed sword, huh?

271
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,260
You knew?!

272
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,970
No. I can just tell.

273
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,990
Starting with the very first one,

274
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,580
all the Kitetsu have
been superior swords,

275
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,710
but every last one is cursed!

276
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,090
Many famous master swordsmen

277
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,270
have met tragic deaths
after taking up Kitetsu swords.

278
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,500
These days, there ain't a single
person who uses a Kitetsu.

279
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,330
Because you'll leave this world
even if you use them unknowingly!

280
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,320
Even I wanna get rid of that thing,
but I'm afraid it'll curse me...

281
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,010
I-I'm sorry! I had no idea it
was such a terrifying sword!

282
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,700
I should've minded my own business!

283
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,800
I like it! I'll take it!

284
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,960
A-Are you a fool?! I can't sell it!

285
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,390
If you die because of it, then
it'd be like I killed you myself!

286
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,980
You're the fool!
Just sell the stupid thing off!

287
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,100
Honey!

288
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,060
Then let's do this.

289
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,520
My luck, and this thing's curse...

290
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,560
Let's see which one's stronger.

291
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,160
You can't be serious!

292
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,830
Stop! Its sharpness is the real deal!
It'll take your whole arm off!

293
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,190
I'll take it.

294
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,400
Hey. Could you choose me another one?

295
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,980
S-Sure...

296
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,580
H-Hold it!

297
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,170
The make is black lacquer...

298
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,100
...and the blade's
temper pattern uneven!

299
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,160
The Ryo-Wazamono "Yubashiri"!

300
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,520
My shop may not be much,
but this is the finest sword I have!

301
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,210
I can't buy that.

302
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,980
I already told you, I got no money.

303
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,780
Forget the money. And I don't
need any for the Kitetsu, either.

304
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,500
I'm sorry for trying to cheat you earlier.

305
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,470
It's been a while since I've
seen a good swordsman's eyes.

306
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,470
They say the sword chooses the owner.

307
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,960
I pray for your good fortune!

308
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,880
I definitely feel more
relaxed with three swords.

309
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,100
Oh, what's this?

310
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,410
I can't believe a big skinflint like
you gave the family treasure away!

311
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,550
What's wrong with one man
entrusting a dream to another?!

312
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,910
Now take out the damn trash!

313
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,060
Y-Yes, ma'am!

314
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,520
I was so frightened...
that I still can't stand up...

315
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,330
What a nice nap!

316
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,500
Alright! Time to go
to the execution platform!

317
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,570
Found him?!

318
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,460
No, not yet!

319
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,170
Are you sure it was
Straw Hat you saw?!

320
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,500
Yes! We're sure!

321
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,920
Alright! Scour the place again!

322
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,140
Yes, sir!

323
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,940
Man, where is the execution platform?

324
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,810
Straw Hat, Straw Hat...

325
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,230
I have no idea at all!

326
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,430
Where's the bastard hiding?!

327
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,570
Where is it?

328
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,550
You see him?!

329
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,920
Where's the execution platform?

330
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,850
That way.

331
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,960
Thanks!

332
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,840
That was...!

333
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,470
Find Luffy! He's gotta be hiding
somewhere in Loguetown still!

334
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,560
Yes, sir!

335
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,140
How many times do I have
to tell you not to shout?

336
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,870
He won't hide.

337
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,480
As long as I'm around,
he'll show up again.

338
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,160
Captain Smoker!
Did something happen?!

339
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,580
Tashigi! Where the hell'd you go?!

340
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,950
C-Captain! We have news!

341
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,910
It's you guys! Thank goodness!
You're conscious again!

342
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,960
I-It was Roronoa Zoro...

343
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,920
We were attacked by Zoro,
the pirate hunter!

344
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,250
Zoro?

345
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,720
Why would he attack you?

346
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,830
He will show up.

347
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,350
I will make it to the
execution platform!

348
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,280
I'm gonna get another look at
the view the King of the Pirates saw!

349
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

350
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

351
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,670
I'll set off by myself,

352
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,630
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

353
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,400
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

354
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,480
Why is it so hot?

355
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:55,490
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

356
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

357
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

358
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

359
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

360
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,410
Apparently, Usopp's
gonna be in a showdown!

361
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,330
Is he crazy?! There's no way
he can beat him! He'll die!

362
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,480
Who's "him"?

363
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,790
The greatest gunslinger
bounty hunter there is.

364
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,990
Cool! Must be thanks
to the wanted poster!

365
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,430
Hold on, Usopp! Where are you
going with all that stuff?!

366
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,260
Is he running away?!

367
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

368
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,790
"Usopp vs. Daddy the Parent;
Showdown at High Noon"

369
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
