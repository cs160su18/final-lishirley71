2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,420
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,020
They... are... so... soft...!

24
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,270
Yummy!

25
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,190
--What?! Is it that good?
--I don't understand what you're saying.

26
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,900
Well, actually...

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,120
I decided not to pay--not even a single Berry.

28
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,040
Thanks for the perfect repairs!

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,460
Sir, it'd be wise not to tease craftsmen like that.

30
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,380
Oh, pardon me.

31
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,640
The pirate way of doing things doesn't
work on craftsmen's turf, now, does it?

32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,980
That tower-like thing is the one.

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,490
Things are huge all over!

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,870
They're strong...

35
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,290
...and skilled.

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,080
They're the pride of Water Seven.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,840
Scary!

38
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,050
Whoa! What's that?!

39
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,680
That's a mask shop.

40
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,560
CP9...

41
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,660
Robin?

42
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,170
I thought we were attacking you in your sleep...

43
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:10,180
"The Franky Family and Iceberg-san"

44
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,560
Who are you bastards?

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,060
Identify yourselves!

46
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,830
"Identify yourselves"?

47
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,750
Pirate hunter Zoro...

48
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,300
We're bounty hunters...

49
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,590
...the Franky Family! Even a crying child
stops crying when they hear our name!

50
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,970
Your head's worth 60 million!
We'll gratefully take it.

51
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,560
And we'll wait in ambush inside your ship...

52
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,350
...and catch the entire crew in one swoop.

53
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,310
We'll make a killing! How lucky!

54
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,650
I'm the first!

55
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,610
"Lucky"?

56
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,490
You mean, "unlucky," right?

57
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,590
Don't flinch!

58
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,550
Two-Sword Style...

59
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,220
...Rhino Cycle!

60
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,520
How senseless...

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,530
D-Dammit!

62
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,290
This is the place.

63
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,380
So, what do you want?

64
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,760
We want cash for our stuff.

65
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,350
How much is this gonna be?

66
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,770
Owner! This is serious!

67
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,730
G-Gold... Th-This much!

68
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:27,240
What?! Take them to the VIP
room im... im... immediately!

69
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,740
Wow! This is comfy!

70
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah! Hey, this is really bouncy!

71
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,660
Does this one also have water in it?

72
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,550
Hm? Hey, don't tell me you're
gonna say they're fake.

73
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,100
F-Far from it! I've been
an appraiser for 25 years.

74
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,020
This is roughly estimated at...

75
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,350
O-One hundred million Berries?!

76
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,980
I-Idiot! You're too loud! Everyone can hear you!

77
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,400
Y-Y-You're gonna give us that much money?!

78
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,950
L-Like... Like I said, Luffy, you're too loud!

79
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,280
This is indeed worth that much.

80
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
This is wonderful gold, taking its
historical value and purity into account.

81
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,290
With that much money,
we can fix the Merry good!

82
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,460
Yeah! We'll even get some change.

83
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Then, we'll spend the rest of the
money to buy a bronze statue!

84
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,960
Don't. Don't buy it.

85
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,760
If you accept that amount, please sign
and put your thumbprint here.

86
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,260
I'll go prepare the money immediately.

87
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,220
Okay! I'll put however
many thumbprints you want!

88
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,060
If that's not enough, I'll put mine, too!

89
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,780
What? What's the matter, Nami?

90
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,370
There're three things I
want to say, Mr. Appraiser.

91
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,880
First... I forgot to tell you, but this guy's
got a 100 million bounty on his head.

92
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,840
Second...

93
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,510
...I don't accept the appraisal
you've just given us.

94
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:18,470
Third... if you lie to us again,
we'll go after your head.

95
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,310
That is all.

96
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,480
I... I'm sorry!

97
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,440
Th-Three hundred million Berries?!
Isn't this a dream?

98
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Our adventure on the sky islands
has finally borne fruit!

99
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm super rich!

100
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,740
That should be "we"!

101
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,160
P-Please come again!

102
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,750
I-I-It became 300 million! I-I'm scared!

103
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,710
I'm carrying 100 million?

104
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,880
Well, Nami can really make scary threats, huh?

105
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,010
I estimated it to be that much from
the start. But then he said 100 million.

106
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,890
You two were restless,
so he didn't take us seriously.

107
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,600
Hey, Luffy. If you flail it like that...

108
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,560
Well, anyway, I'm glad it went well.

109
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,100
Huh?

110
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,480
Ahhhh! The river!

111
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,440
100 million Berries are gonna sink into the river!

112
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,110
Phew! That was close!

113
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,000
--I'm gonna knock you out!
--I'm gonna break your teeth, you son of a bitch!

114
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,710
I-I'm... I'm sorry.

115
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,500
Did you hear that?

116
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,170
Yeah. They said 300 million Berries.

117
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,380
They must be members of the Straw Hats.

118
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,050
That's a bigger amount than their total bounty.

119
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,930
We're changing the plan.

120
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,520
Hey, go let the guys who
went to their ship know.

121
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,070
S-Say, Nami, maybe we really
should take it back to the ship.

122
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,030
That'd be a waste of time.
The shipyard is right over this hill.

123
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,040
Hey, I'm a bit shocked you guys
won't let me near the money.

124
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,790
Once we see a shipwright,

125
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,500
we'll probably need to go back to the Merry
right away so that he can assess the repair fee...

126
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,710
I see.

127
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,960
That's true.

128
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,300
I don't really know what to do, since I've
never carried so much cash around.

129
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,680
Well, that's only natural.

130
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,140
I can't understand why a
person would flail it around.

131
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,680
Ah! Hey, look over there! They're selling
water buns! Let's buy 100 of them!

132
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,310
--Shut up.
-Then, let's buy 1,000 of them!

133
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,310
--Shut up.
--Then...

134
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,560
Shut up!

135
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,070
Okay...

136
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,550
We're back at the entrance to the shipyard.

137
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,270
Good! Looks like the
crowd from earlier is gone.

138
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,270
Anyway, let's find... well...
What's his name again?

139
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,190
Iceberg-san.

140
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,570
Right, that's it! Ice pops!

141
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,610
I wonder who he is.

142
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,280
The granny at the station told us to ask him.

143
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,240
Yeah...

144
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,210
More importantly, I wonder if
it's okay to go inside there?

145
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm coming in!

146
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,080
Not again!

147
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,710
--Hold it!
--Hm?

148
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,210
Wait.

149
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,680
You're an outsider, aren't you?

150
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,930
Let's talk outside for now.

151
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,890
Only authorized people can go inside the plant.

152
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,190
Heave-ho.

153
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,360
Do you have some business at this dock?

154
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,410
Oh, it's you, Usopp.

155
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,410
Hey! I'm right here, Luffy!

156
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,330
Yeah. He's square-ish!

157
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,080
Which means, he's square Usopp!

158
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,290
No, I'm not a triangle or a square.

159
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,790
Oh, yeah! Um... We'd like to see Iceberg-san.

160
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,590
Hm? Iceberg-san? Are you a customer?

161
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,430
Oh, I see.

162
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,600
This is a reference letter from
Granny Kokoro at Shift Station, huh?

163
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,970
Hm? Are you an old guy?

164
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,640
I'm 23.

165
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,020
23... You talk like an old man.

166
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,060
People often tell me that.

167
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,440
So... do you know this Iceberg person?

168
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,410
Know him? Well, Iceberg-san
is the mayor of Water Seven.

169
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,240
Whoa... So he's that high up?

170
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,700
Not only is he the mayor,

171
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,500
he's the president of our company,
Galley-La Company,

172
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,130
and he also manages the sea train.

173
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,960
So he's the most powerful guy in town?!

174
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Well, in Water Seven, there's no
one who doesn't know him.

175
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,590
Where do we have to go to see him?

176
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,220
Hmm, I wonder where he is right now.

177
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,680
He can be hard to find,
since he's a very busy person.

178
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,480
Oh... Can't you get in touch
with him or something?

179
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,440
That's probably possible, but...
Are you in a hurry?

180
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,400
It's not that we're in a hurry, but...

181
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,360
In short, you want to talk about
having your ship repaired, right?

182
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,200
Where did you anchor your ship?

183
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,530
Rocky cape.

184
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,790
Well then, I'll go run and check
the condition of your ship.

185
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,130
It'll save some time when you see Iceberg-san.

186
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,340
You can talk about the repair fee, too.

187
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,010
"Go run"...? On a Yagara bull?

188
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,970
If I do that, you'll grow tired of waiting.
Well, just wait for ten minutes.

189
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,930
Ten minutes?

190
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,600
That's right. Ten minutes.

191
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,320
Whoa!

192
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,240
--He's fast!
--Whoooa!

193
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,320
Oof!

194
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,330
Ahhh! He jumped!

195
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,750
What... but wait! Over there is...

196
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,170
...a precipice!

197
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,170
--Ahhhh!
--He fell!

198
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,140
Amazing!

199
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,560
Is he okay?

200
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,020
He runs freely in town.

201
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,520
--What?
--Huh?

202
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,480
People call him the "Mountain Wind."

203
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,400
He's a shipwright foreman of
Galley-La Company's Dock #1...

204
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
His name is Kaku.

205
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,290
Well, well... I see...

206
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,920
The city of water... This is amazing!

207
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,590
Clear springs and rivers...
Clean streets and lively crowds...

208
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,930
And many pretty women.

209
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,260
I wanna go out on a date with Nami-san
or Robin-chan in a town like this!

210
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,180
Being between two pretty women is good, too.

211
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,560
This side is Nami-san
and this side is Robin-chan.

212
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,730
Hey, mister. Stop making that weird face.

213
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,200
So which water-water napa
cabbage are you gonna buy?

214
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,660
Hm? Oh, yes, I'll buy both. Oh, and...

215
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,200
I want to get some food that's in season
from this town. What's available?

216
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,460
Water-water apples and water-water pears!

217
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,670
Interested in fish that are in season?
My hubby runs a fish shop.

218
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,090
Where is it?

219
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,430
Get back on the land, turn right
six times and turn left twelve times.

220
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,390
Huh?

221
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,350
Let's see... Hm? What the heck...?

222
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,890
In any case, it sure is
inconvenient when we have to walk.

223
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,400
Another dead end? Shucks.

224
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,780
Did I get lost? This is bad...

225
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,240
I'm just like a certain damn swordsman.

226
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,030
Hm?

227
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh! Robin-chan!

228
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Hello! It's me! Yoo-hoo!

229
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,170
Robin-chan!

230
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,760
Hm?

231
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
She disappeared?

232
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,180
When there're no doors or streets?

233
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,470
Did she fly or something?

234
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,140
Hm?

235
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,650
Usopp?

236
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,110
What's with this town?
Am I the one who's off here?

237
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,290
Oh... That ship must be the one.

238
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,880
Pardon me.

239
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,230
Oh, it's just Usopp.

240
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,100
I see. It's damaged.

241
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,650
The mast needs to be replaced, too.

242
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,570
Usopp...

243
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,330
Hold on a sec! Who the hell are you?!

244
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,870
Oh, I'm sorry. I woke you up.

245
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,250
Boy... was I shocked!

246
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,540
He jumped from there!

247
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,840
Well... Don't make light of my craftsmen.

248
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,520
--Come to think of it, who's this guy?
--Beats me.

249
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,270
In order to build a faster, stronger ship quickly,

250
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,480
an ordinary physical ability isn't good enough.

251
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,650
By the way, Kalifa...

252
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,770
Yes, I've already checked.

253
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,740
Straw Hat Luffy,
pirate hunter Zoro, Nico Robin...

254
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,450
Their group has those three members
with bounties on their heads.

255
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,410
Their total bounty is 239 million Berries.

256
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,700
It was formed in the East Blue.

257
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,750
They're the Straw Hats, and they
currently have seven crewmembers.

258
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,670
Th-They know about us big time.

259
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,090
I see. I'm glad you came.

260
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,090
I'm Iceberg, the boss of this city.

261
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,640
And this is a mouse I found earlier.

262
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,050
His name is... let's see...

263
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,640
...Tyrannosaurus.

264
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,850
I have to prepare his food and cage.

265
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,270
I've already taken care of them, Iceberg-san.

266
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,600
Well, that's my Kalifa.

267
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,480
Thank you.

268
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,320
More importantly, you're dining with
an executive from a glassware factory

269
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,650
at the hotel in Chiza in ten minutes.

270
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,200
After that, you'll give a
talk at the Liguria Square.

271
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,580
When that's done,
a conference with Mr. Bimine,

272
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,660
the mayor of the gourmet town Pucci.

273
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,620
You'll also be interviewed by
a newspaper company there.

274
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,750
After that, please go back to the main
office and go through some documents.

275
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,750
I don't want to!

276
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,340
Well then, I'll cancel them all.

277
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,920
Hey! Is that okay?!

278
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,930
I'm someone powerful enough
to do things like that.

279
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,850
You're completely unfit to be a mayor.

280
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,060
What a selfish guy you are!

281
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,350
But isn't this guy the one
that granny was talking about?

282
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,900
Yeah, he's "that guy."

283
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,570
How insolent!

284
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,490
What'd you do that for?!

285
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,330
Holy crap!

286
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,830
Where're your manners?! Referring to one
of the world's leading shipbuilding engineers

287
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,750
as "this guy" and "that guy"...!

288
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,500
What's going on?

289
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,970
Kalifa, the secretary, has exploded
for the first time in a while!

290
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,220
I wanna be kicked by her, too.

291
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,010
Pardon me. I lost my head there for a moment.

292
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,230
However, Iceberg-san is admired
by the citizens. Please be polite.

293
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,270
Try not to get Kalifa angry.
When she gets angry...

294
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,020
"Ouch"

295
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,190
...she is indiscriminate.

296
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,690
"Ouch"

297
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,190
"Ouch"

298
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,740
You kicked him big time!

299
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,150
You're the one who's impolite!

300
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,740
Um, but in any case, you're Iceberg-san, right?

301
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,620
Please look at this. It's a reference letter.

302
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,410
From Granny Kokoro...

303
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,580
"Take a look at their ship.
Kokoro"

304
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,580
"Take a look at their ship," huh?

305
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,540
Ahhh!

306
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,960
What?! You won't?! Please!
Please repair our ship!

307
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,710
We have money!

308
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,180
The Merry is beat up after
our voyages! Please, pops!

309
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,470
--Okay.
--How frivolous! So it's okay?!

310
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,220
--Yep.
--Then why did you rip it up?

311
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,390
Her lipstick mark was unpleasant.

312
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,730
Granny Kokoro and I have
been drinking pals for ages.

313
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,480
Well... that being said, Kaku has
already gone to make an assessment.

314
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,690
The matter is already in progress. Don't worry.

315
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,610
It's a boring day today anyway.

316
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,160
Shall I show you around the factory?

317
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,330
Whoa! Seriously?

318
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,660
Well then, this way, please.

319
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,710
Is that the attitude a man who
canceled his appointments should have?

320
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,870
All right! We're gonna go
to the shipbuilding plant!

321
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,840
Oh, that's right. The money...

322
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,500
Money... What?

323
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,800
What? What? What?

324
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,760
Whaaat?!

325
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,760
Hm? What's the matter, Usopp?

326
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,730
Th-Th-The money... The money is gone!

327
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,180
Whaaat?!

328
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,770
--Look for it thoroughly!
--I can't find it!

329
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,150
--Hm? Huh?
--It's gone! I can't find it anywhere!

330
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,150
Ahh!

331
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,610
Ahh! Over there!

332
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,830
H... Hey, you bastards! Who the
hell are you?! Who are you?!

333
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,500
Why are you taking our money?!

334
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,040
Hey! Hold it!

335
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,000
Thanks for the money!

336
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,930
Give us our money back!

337
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,070
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

338
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,610
Chasing after something constant

339
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,200
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

340
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,490
Even when we're exhausted

341
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,660
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

342
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,090
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

343
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,010
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

344
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

345
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,760
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

346
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,850
Eternally... Eternally...

347
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,640
Wild fantasies from our childhood

348
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,480
We trace unforgettable memories

349
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,150
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

350
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,990
To this familiar sunny sky

351
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,780
Together we entrust our feelings

352
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,370
We go beyond the changing time

353
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,000
Eternally... Eternally...

354
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,880
Hey, Usopp! Did you give them the money?!

355
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,380
Why would I do that?! They stole it!

356
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,260
At any rate, your ship...

357
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,300
Oh, how was she?

358
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,430
...must've had some tremendous journeys.

359
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,140
Yep, she has. Please fix her good!

360
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,930
Frankly speaking, your ship...

361
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,350
I won't give up the bronze statue!

362
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,350
--...can no longer be fixed.
--What?

363
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

364
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,940
"Galley-La Company! A Grand Sight, Dock #1!"

365
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
