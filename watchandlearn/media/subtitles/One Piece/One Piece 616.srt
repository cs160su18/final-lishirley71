00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,140
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,440
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,300
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

5
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,110
a boy whose body turned to rubber

6
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,650
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,600
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,660
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,040
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,920
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

11
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,290
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

12
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,180
They learned about the ruler of
Punk Hazard - Caesar's motive

13
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,820
and all while trying to escape Shinokuni,

14
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,020
along with their pirate ally
- the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

15
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,410
they are on the move to kidnap Caesar,

16
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,200
save the children, and
escape from the island.

17
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Catch me if you can! But I'm protected!

18
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
Doflamingo! The Four Emperors!

19
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,370
Do you even have balls to
pick a fight with them?

20
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,250
--I don't think so! If you wanna run, do it now!
--A fight?

21
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,300
Get out of my face!

22
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,140
I've been...

23
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,390
...picking fights all along!

24
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,890
"A Surprising Outcome!
White Chase vs. Vergo!"

25
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,510
M-Master!

26
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,550
Ow, ow, ow... My nose!

27
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,990
You broke my nose!

28
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,850
How dare you! Dammit!

29
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,600
Ow, ow, ow...

30
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,650
Damn you! Were you even listening to me?!

31
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,520
You can't get away with this!

32
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,530
I have that crazy pirate backing me!

33
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,300
One of the Seven Warlords
- Don Quixote Doflamingo!

34
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,290
He is the behind-the-scenes
string-puller of the New World!

35
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,880
Small arms, war weapons, drugs...

36
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,630
He's involved in every risky transaction!

37
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,600
He's the mastermind of the underground!

38
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,730
He's connected to all the notorious figures!

39
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,900
You're no match for him!

40
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,100
He'll bring you under in a matter of minutes!

41
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,340
You and your friends!

42
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,320
B-But I can still spare your life.

43
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,550
I-I-If you apologize now...

44
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,010
Think about how many monsters you will

45
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,500
piss off if you do something to me!

46
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,340
Okay?!

47
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,670
Hey, are you listening?! Hmmm?

48
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,390
I'm talking about the Warlords
and the Four Emperors!

49
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,960
They'll make you...

50
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,630
...drown at sea in the blink of an eye!

51
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,310
I-If you apologize now, I'll
let you off the hook...

52
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Gastille!

53
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,700
That serves you right!

54
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,900
Yeah!

55
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,370
A gas burner attack that could melt iron!

56
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,290
Did he get melted away? Or incinerated?!

57
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,290
I-I-I-I know! It doesn't feel
like it's real, does it?!

58
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,010
It's too much for a rookie who
just came to the New World!

59
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,890
But one of those monsters is here in the lab.

60
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,490
It's Vergo!

61
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,100
No one can compete against his Armament Haki!

62
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,820
Smoker and Law are goners!

63
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,300
So are all of your crew!

64
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,090
I-I-I said you're all gonna die!

65
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,990
S-S-So why don't you listen to me...

66
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,410
I said...

67
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,080
...I don't care!

68
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,710
Smoker...

69
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,260
Vergo!

70
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,140
How dare you screw with the Navy!

71
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,760
You're too weak. You can't beat me.

72
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,210
You never learn.

73
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,680
My basic fighting skill and
Haki are better than yours.

74
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,310
You still don't get it?

75
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,810
Too slow!

76
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,910
White Blow!

77
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,690
You keep on fighting because you're

78
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,070
angry at me for betraying the Navy?

79
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,800
I just want to settle the matter!

80
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,740
I have to finish you off with my own hands!

81
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,400
Pirate Vergo!

82
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,160
Your Haki isn't good enough to beat me.

83
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,840
Why can't you see that?

84
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,150
Shinokuni is a lethal gas that petrifies
human bodies and kills them.

85
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,360
And it is now flowing into the laboratory.

86
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,930
Hey, what are you doing?!

87
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,630
If you were going straight,

88
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,730
we should've been caught
up with the kids by now!

89
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,520
Shut up! You're wounded - shut your mouth!

90
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,190
I am going straight!

91
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,610
No! Not that way!

92
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,330
No! You went too far!

93
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,500
How can you mess up something this simple?!

94
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,740
Shut up!

95
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,500
Hurry up, kids! Keep running!

96
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,290
I feel dizzy. It feels
like I've been dreaming.

97
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,110
That's because of the sedatives.

98
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,170
They're harmless so don't worry!

99
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,970
Guys! Keep your eyes on the kids!

100
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,140
Yes, sir! Brother!

101
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,930
Yeah!

102
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,120
Mocha! Stay with me!

103
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,030
You're gonna be alright soon!

104
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,600
Come on! Get it all out!

105
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,860
The survivors are heading
toward R Building, 1st floor -

106
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,700
the location of the last exit

107
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,110
and ground zero of the fight
between Luffy and Caesar!

108
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,620
Meanwhile, Kin'emon is looking
for his son Momonosuke...

109
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,000
What have I done?! Momonosuke!

110
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,590
What?! Momonosuke turned to a small dragon?!

111
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,510
Uh-huh!

112
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
I shouldn't tell anybody but it's true.

113
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
Maybe I...

114
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,470
...sliced up Momonosuke?!

115
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,440
Momonosuke!

116
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,230
I've done a terrible thing!

117
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Kin'emon-san, you can't go back!

118
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,740
That area is filled up with the gas by now...

119
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,490
The deadly gas is right in front of us!

120
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,940
My spirit will carry me through anything!

121
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,040
Whether it's fire or gas!

122
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,830
Momonosuke!

123
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,380
No, that's impossible! Kin'emon-san!

124
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,940
The Sea Prism Stone handcuffs...
Maybe, they're here.

125
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,430
No, they aren't!

126
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,390
Because I hear the "Usopp
alarm" ringing in my head now.

127
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,320
Yes, let's just pretend
that I checked this room.

128
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,240
That's it!

129
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,300
Tell them "I looked all over but
the Sea Prism Handcuffs weren't..."

130
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,650
"...in that room!"

131
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,330
He's an enemy!

132
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,880
Why is this always happening to me?!

133
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,630
White...

134
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,840
...Blow!

135
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,260
Are you satisfied now, Smoker-kun?

136
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,460
No matter how deeply you believe in justice,

137
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,420
you can't do anything if you're weak!

138
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,910
What do you want?

139
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,920
If I can take my heart back,

140
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,800
I can kick your ass easily, Vergo!

141
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,640
Don't make me repeat myself, squirt!

142
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,390
It's Vergo-san to you!

143
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,540
Tashigi, I want you to lead the G-5 soldiers.

144
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,950
Where are you going, Smoker-san?

145
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,580
Don't tell me you're going after Vergo!

146
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,360
The law can't settle these matters, Tashigi!

147
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,460
I have to do it myself! He was
messing around with the Navy!

148
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,950
Stop it, Tashigi!

149
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,430
Wouldn't you rather die than
grovel before a pirate?!

150
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,360
Right now, we have to beg for our lives,

151
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,010
throwing ourselves at his
feet if that's what it takes!

152
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,060
Because if we die here,
we can't save our people!

153
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,730
And the children...

154
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,780
You're gonna die here, too, Law!

155
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,130
Smoker...

156
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,890
Do you still wanna fight, Smoker-kun?

157
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,010
You know you're no match for me.

158
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,610
What are you doing?

159
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,730
You shouldn't turn to
smoke and spread yourself

160
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,280
thin when you're facing a better Haki user.

161
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,640
It just makes it easier for me to hit you!

162
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,480
Why do you keep using
your Devil Fruit power?

163
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Can't you even think straight?

164
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,950
It's not like you, Smoker-kun.

165
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,580
Enough playing around!

166
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,550
Demon Bamboo!

167
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,210
I know you wanna kill me
for messing with the Navy.

168
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,850
But you have to be strong
enough to do so, Smoker.

169
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
If you're just reckless, you can't
make your people proud of you.

170
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,040
It's over.

171
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,140
Smoker, my heart...

172
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,350
Thank you for winning it back!

173
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,730
Now it makes sense! You bastard!

174
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,570
That's why you turned to smoke!

175
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,490
Now we're even.

176
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,320
Just finish him off already!

177
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,810
You don't wanna owe a pirate, huh?

178
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,470
It's a dishonor to a Navy soldier.

179
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,580
I'm too ashamed to be seen by my people.

180
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,790
But...

181
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,960
...that was just the help I needed.

182
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,680
It's over.

183
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,880
Vergo... -san.

184
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,670
You child!

185
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,860
Now you remember that I'm better than you?

186
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,050
I just want you to keep thinking like that.

187
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,460
But you can't stay sitting
on that "throne" forever!

188
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,030
You two!

189
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,870
I know you're listening, "Joker"!

190
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,930
Vergo is a dead man, Joker.

191
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,980
You're about to lose your right-hand man.

192
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,850
And Straw Hat-ya will take care of Caesar.

193
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,950
That means you're also gonna lose SAD.

194
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,650
You couldn't see this coming
because you were overconfident.

195
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,740
So why don't you just keep
cackling like always

196
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,860
and think about your next move.

197
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,680
But you won't be laughing for long because...

198
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,870
...we're gonna do the unthinkable!

199
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,200
Nice try acting strong, squirt!

200
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,460
But are you sure you'll survive?

201
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,610
Look at Vergo in front of you.

202
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,180
Didn't you piss him off?

203
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,000
Do you remember what happened last time?

204
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,610
How did it go?

205
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,510
You pissed Vergo off and then what happened?

206
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,450
It must've been traumatic.
You probably can't forget it.

207
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,290
You must be afraid of Vergo.

208
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,750
Even with your incomparable swordplay,

209
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,120
his Haki will allow him to
block your every attack.

210
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,280
Both in terms of status and power,

211
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,060
you're no match for Vergo!

212
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,420
Here we go!

213
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,960
It's been two years since
the War of the Best.

214
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,760
Did anyone actually accomplish anything?

215
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,520
All you did was stay calm.

216
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,150
All Whitebeard did was end the era.

217
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,000
The Navy Headquarters rounded up new forces.

218
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,750
The big-timers didn't take any action!

219
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,670
It was like everybody was
just preparing for something.

220
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,940
That war was only a beginning.

221
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,620
You always told me...

222
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,850
...that the new era of the daring ones

223
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,200
is coming along with an unstoppable swell!

224
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,770
I broke... the gear!

225
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,030
Now,

226
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,760
there is no turning back!

227
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,630
Law's attack turns the tables in an instant.

228
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,330
The Straw Hats scramble
and aim for a quick getaway.

229
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,720
But Caesar, at the pinnacle of his rage...

230
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,940
...unleashes a terrible attack on Luffy...

231
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,020
...that annihilates friend and foe alike.

232
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

233
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,730
"Caesar's Defeat!-- The
Powerful Grizzly Magnum!"

234
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,820
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
