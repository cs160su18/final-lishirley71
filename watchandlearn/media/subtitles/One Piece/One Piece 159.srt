00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:16,380
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,610
After a great adventure,

21
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,840
Luffy and company finally
reached the sky island of Skypiea.

22
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,180
However, Nami's group was taken
away by "Heaven's Judgment,"

23
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,190
so Luffy and the others headed
for God's island of Upper Yard,

24
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,960
with Conis leading the way, but...

25
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,340
The Crow!

26
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,140
You can't be serious!

27
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,420
Crows...

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,090
aren't even waterfowl.

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,190
Your exit is Gate #2.

30
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,040
It will lead you to the giant Milky Road,
which connects to Upper Yard.

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Y-You simply need to take that.

32
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,610
Hey. Conis.

33
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,700
Yes?

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,460
Why've you been shaking
ever since we left your house?

35
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,730
Forgive me, Conis-san...

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,510
It is our citizens' duty.

37
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,790
Could you run away?

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,340
I was the one who called
the Super-Express Lobster!

39
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,240
Once we know someone's a criminal,

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,020
we'll be killed if we don't lead
them to the place of judgment!

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,040
Thank goodness! Conis-chan...!

42
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,530
I know who you are.

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
Please come back...

44
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,820
...God!

45
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,450
"Onward, Crow! To the Sacrificial Altar"

46
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,470
Is Conis gonna be alright?

47
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,720
She tried to save us and
wound up as an accomplice!

48
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,910
She's gonna have hell to pay for sure!

49
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,930
That old Sky Knight said
he'd hold on to her, but...

50
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,260
Nah, that weird old guy doesn't seem bad.

51
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,930
Got no other choice.

52
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,150
I wanna protect her, but we
can't take her with us, either.

53
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,440
Yeah, we probably are in
more danger than her...

54
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,950
What with a "sacrificial altar"
and some "ordeal" waiting for us...

55
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,900
Geez, this thing is slow...

56
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,540
Of course it is.
It's many times heavier than a waver.

57
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,630
Don't be picky!

58
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,330
Hey, look! What's that humongous forest?!

59
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,830
Is that Upper Yard?!

60
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,840
Wow! Was there a forest like that on the map?!

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,200
No, there is a forest here,

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,750
but it's nothing like this.

63
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,810
It's just a normal one.

64
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,580
People from 200 years ago had that map, right?

65
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,560
It might've been an old map when they had it.

66
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,620
It'd take at least a thousand years
for such giant trees to grow!

67
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,170
That's true...

68
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,630
But they sure are big trees!

69
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,500
I wanna climb 'em!

70
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,530
It's the entrance!

71
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,890
Well, if we're gonna turn back,
now's our chance.

72
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,380
You ready, Usopp?

73
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,560
Eh?! Well, if it's possible, I'd like to go back--

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,530
Let's go!

75
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,350
You weren't planning to listen to me!

76
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,530
I wanna go back...

77
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,310
There's things here!

78
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,780
Well, it is a forest!

79
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,790
Yeah.

80
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,340
No, wait! Look around, you guys!

81
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,610
These are wrecked ships!

82
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,910
It is a forest!

83
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,020
Yeah.

84
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,040
How are they related?!

85
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,800
Plus they've all been sliced right in half...!

86
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,400
Not again!

87
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,640
Forests are full of all kinds of stuff, you--

88
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,360
No!

89
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,750
Full speed ahead! All ahead full!
Paddle! Paddle, hurry! Forward!

90
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,980
Huh? What's going on?

91
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,840
A sickle monster!

92
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,700
Don't let your guard down!
Another one's coming!

93
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,420
No... Not just one...!

94
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,210
Paddle like crazy!

95
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,890
What the hell is this?!

96
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,990
Watch where you're going! Hit the brake, Luffy!

97
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,270
No, we're not gonna make it!
Take the wheel, Usopp!

98
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,270
Gum-Gum...

99
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,380
Hey, Luffy! What're you doing?! Aim forward!

100
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,860
Just keep moving forward!

101
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,490
...Bazooka!

102
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,810
Dodged it!

103
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,900
That was close!

104
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,830
There's still more?!

105
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,300
Now spears?!

106
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,610
--Usopp! Right!
--No, left!

107
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,100
--Which one?!
--Just dodge 'em!

108
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,920
They just keep coming!

109
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,730
They're gonna get us sooner or later!

110
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,100
What a pain! All together! Gum-Gum...

111
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,070
...Pinwheel!

112
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,530
Made it through...

113
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,490
I sure hope there's no more of this...!

114
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,250
Now what?!

115
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,440
We dodged it!

116
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,120
No...

117
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,550
It's coming back!

118
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,960
Dodge!

119
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,850
That damn Super-Express Lobster
just deserted us here...

120
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,170
Where exactly are we?

121
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,420
"God"

122
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,360
What's for certain is that it's
the interior of Upper Yard...

123
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,410
It's almost as if this is a sacrifice altar...

124
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,920
Sacrifice... altar?

125
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,990
Nami. What's a "sacrifice"?

126
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,490
It means being offered
to God while you're alive.

127
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,150
Oh, that's all?

128
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,120
I thought it meant being
boiled alive or something...

129
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,860
Hot!

130
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,190
Actually, it's something like that...

131
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,570
Whatever the method, your life is given to God.

132
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,170
Eh?! Does that mean we
are going to be killed?!

133
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,770
Chopper!

134
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,380
Geez!

135
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,020
What is that?!

136
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,990
A shark... in the sky... A skyshark?

137
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,450
Zoro!

138
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,210
Zoro!

139
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,880
Can't see much...! Where the hell is it?!

140
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,420
I'm way out of my element!

141
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,500
I can't move as well as I can on land...!

142
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,170
Damn! Damn! Damn!

143
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,950
We dodged it!

144
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,340
It's coming back!

145
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,970
I'm sick of this place! You couldn't
have enough lives to survive this!

146
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm going back, I don't care what anyone says!

147
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,810
No! Usopp!

148
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,250
Shaddup! I'm captain of the Crow!

149
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,450
Since when?!

150
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,300
Since now!

151
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,200
Even if we do go back,

152
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,060
there's no guarantee we'll return safely. See?

153
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,410
It's coming back!

154
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,820
Alright, you! Gum-Gum...

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,880
That's it!

156
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,780
Get it, Luffy!

157
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,130
I can't think of anything.

158
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,280
Just dodge! Our only option now is to run!

159
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,810
We managed to dodge it...

160
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,370
But this is bad! Now we can't even go back!

161
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,620
We've come a long way from the entrance...!

162
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Wanna get off here?

163
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,860
Don't be stupid! I'll die!

164
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,310
Yeah, probably.

165
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,870
What was that?! A snake?!

166
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,550
A lamprey. A "sky lamprey," I guess?

167
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,400
One that big'll do more than suck a little blood!

168
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,220
What a neat forest!

169
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,940
Neat, my butt!

170
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,530
If this is our "ordeal," I've had enough!

171
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,370
But we just entered the forest.

172
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,100
We're in for big trouble if we stop
or dawdle on this Milky Road...

173
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,850
Looks like our only choice is to keep moving!

174
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,010
What happened to you, Zoro?!

175
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,760
There he is!

176
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,690
Zoro!

177
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,090
The skyshark is beating Zoro!

178
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,960
H-He went under again!

179
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,890
Zoro isn't coming back up!

180
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,240
Do you think... he got eaten?!

181
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,570
Zoro was eaten!

182
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,240
If he was eaten, the clouds would turn red.

183
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,000
How can you say something
so scary so calmly, Robin?!

184
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,370
I'm sick of you!

185
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,240
This is bad...

186
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,660
Doesn't look like swimming
outta here will do us any good...

187
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,420
You punched that shark!
I thought you were a swordsman?!

188
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,990
You're so strong, Zoro!

189
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,160
What happened to your
so-called "swordsman pride"?

190
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,870
Will you quit nagging about everything?!

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,570
There wasn't just one!

192
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,720
There's a whole swarm of skysharks!

193
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,720
We'll be here all night if we try
to take on every single one.

194
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,360
Can't get even get to shore like this...

195
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,910
Though we can't just sit here, either.

196
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,010
That giant lobster brought us
to one hell of a place...

197
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,110
Do you suppose starving us
here is "Heaven's Judgment"?

198
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,720
Would God really do something so bland?

199
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,330
I don't know. I've never met him before.

200
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,110
This is bad...

201
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,870
We can't set sail with the hull like this.

202
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,110
Try to fix the ship somehow, Chopper.

203
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,330
Eh?! Me?! Okay.

204
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,320
Fix it? Are you planning to do something?

205
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,010
I'm gonna get into this forest somehow.

206
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,310
We should probably make
this our base of operations.

207
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,940
I'm sure Luffy and the others
are headed here in search of us.

208
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,420
It's like they say, "If you get lost,
stay where you are."

209
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,310
Especially you!

210
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,120
Say, Zoro.

211
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,120
You said you're gonna
go into the forest, but what for?

212
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,680
God's on this island, right?
I'm gonna go meet him.

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,290
I'm telling you, that's a bad idea!

214
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,630
What if you run into those freaks?!

215
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,500
Dunno. Depends on how they act.

216
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,800
Zoro... You seem even mightier than God...

217
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,340
He has priests on this island too, you know!

218
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,010
We can't make God angry!

219
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,720
It's common sense, you know!

220
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,480
Sorry, but...

221
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,160
...I've never once prayed to God.

222
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,110
So cool!

223
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,160
Don't believe in him, either.
So I got no obligation to him.

224
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,550
Oh, Lord! I have nothing to do with him!

225
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,510
Please don't punish me!

226
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,200
You're so awesome, Zoro!

227
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,090
Damn... I wish this would end already...!

228
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,930
This is just a warm-up!

229
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,610
Supposedly, there are neat-sounding
priests waiting for us ahead!

230
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,820
So, what, you're saying none
of this was part of our "ordeal"?!

231
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,090
Yeah, I doubt it.

232
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,330
You saw that attack back at the docks.

233
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,590
I dunno how it works,
but that's some incredible power.

234
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,060
One hit from that and you're a goner.

235
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah...

236
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,530
This "God Eneru" is mysterious.

237
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Seems like he's been keeping
constant watch over us...

238
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,740
Do you think God was in that town?!

239
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,280
He'd have to have been,
to attack so accurately like that...

240
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,510
No, not necessarily. We are
talking about God here!

241
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,920
He might be able to foresee everything!

242
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,260
He might even be watching
us at this very moment!

243
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,840
When did you become such a believer?

244
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,740
You're not even from here!

245
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,090
That's not the issue.

246
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,140
God is great, right?

247
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,850
You gotta bow to great people,
even if you don't mean it!

248
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,200
Then you can worry about other things!

249
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,660
I guess, but there are un-great
gods in the world, too.

250
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,570
Like the gods of poverty... and pestilence...

251
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,630
Who're you referring to?!

252
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,440
All that said, looks like our
next guest is here to see us!

253
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,220
Not another one!

254
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,680
That vine looks usable.

255
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,830
You're right. Good idea.

256
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,000
Mind if I join you, Mr. Swordsman?

257
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Huh?! No, but don't be slowin' me down!

258
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,030
Hold on! Where are you going, Robin?!

259
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,500
Look at this.

260
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,810
At least a thousand years have
passed since this altar was built.

261
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,460
A thousand years?!

262
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,040
Historical things like this
make my body tingle...!

263
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,270
Where there is great history,

264
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,950
there should be just as many old relics...

265
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,890
I'd wager even a few jewel
fragments would help out our ship.

266
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,920
I'm coming, too!

267
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,110
Eh?! After you were so scared?!

268
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,550
It's for historical investigation!

269
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,980
She has Berries in her eyes...

270
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,380
How's that?

271
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,610
Perfect.

272
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,170
What is that? A catchphrase?

273
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,370
Robin is amazing!

274
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,720
She did it so easily...

275
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,900
I'm kind of high up...

276
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,430
It's about 50 meters. Mess up and you die!

277
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,740
Could you please not say that?!

278
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,750
I really am a goner if I fall!

279
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,460
Nami...

280
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,350
Alright, fine! I'm going!
Is that what you want?!

281
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,050
T-Too fast! I can't stop!

282
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,060
See, you have guts.

283
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,740
I apologize for the inconvenience.

284
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,850
Not at all.

285
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,300
That's what you get for not going, "Aa-aa-aa!"

286
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Is that the issue here?!

287
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,580
This certainly is a big forest...

288
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,730
Okay, Chopper! You're in charge of the ship!

289
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,860
We're counting on you!

290
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,040
We'll be back soon!

291
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,930
Right! Be careful, everyone!

292
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,000
Come back safe, now!

293
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,400
I guess Nami is okay,
since she has Zoro and Robin...

294
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,590
I'm too scared to go...

295
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,430
Everyone is so brave and amazing!

296
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,990
I wonder if I'll be brave, too, someday?

297
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,150
Anyway, I'll do everything I can now!

298
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,840
Being all alone and in charge of
the ship in this dangerous forest

299
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,380
is proof that everyone trusts in me!

300
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,570
I gotta do my best!

301
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,210
Yeah! I'm all alone in this dangerous place--

302
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,930
I'm the one in the most danger!

303
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,180
A lamprey!

304
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,720
Hey, do you think that huge thing
would taste good roasted?

305
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,220
Forget it. This is no time for cooking.

306
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,490
Darn. Gum-Gum...

307
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,230
...Pistol!

308
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,850
Sky islands are scary... Sky islands are scary...

309
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,360
Wanna get off here?

310
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,290
Are you stupid?! You're asking me to die!

311
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,260
I'm scared! Gimme a break!

312
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,640
Now there's a giant!

313
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,190
No. That's a statue!

314
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,140
Oh. But it's a total dead-end!

315
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,320
No, there are four entrances!

316
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,650
Don't tell me they each
lead to different places?!

317
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,440
"Swamp Ordeal"

318
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,840
"Swamp Ordeal"...

319
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,840
"Iron Ordeal"

320
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,910
"Iron Ordeal"...

321
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,830
"String Ordeal"

322
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,810
"String Ordeal"...

323
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,360
"Ball Ordeal"

324
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,370
"Ball Ordeal"...

325
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,140
Are we allowed to go in any one?!

326
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,210
Is God trying to play games
with us or something?!

327
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,150
Four ordeals...

328
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,140
Which do we choose?

329
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:22,110
Even if we're far apart

330
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:28,570
I don't want you to forget

331
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:38,060
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

332
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,750
You have a friend here to share the pain

333
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:52,360
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

334
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,950
I won't let it just be a dream

335
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:05,620
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

336
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:12,800
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

337
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,260
What do we do? Which do we go in?

338
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,100
Ball! Ball! It sounds like fun!

339
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,050
These are ordeals! They're not gonna be fun!

340
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,130
Whatever, it's decided.
Just don't let your guard down!

341
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,460
What is this place?!

342
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,570
Balls! Balls!

343
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,220
How is this an ordeal?!

344
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,490
On the next episode of One Piece!

345
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,560
"10% Survival Rate! Satori, the Mantra Master!"

346
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,650
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
