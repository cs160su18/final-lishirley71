00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,590
Of all people,

3
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,010
over the lives of everyone in this world,

4
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,800
she chose the lives of the six of you.

5
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,700
Robin! Get off the train!

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,580
We'll fight for you no matter
who we're up against!

7
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,370
Wait!

8
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,840
Robin!

9
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,560
So you didn't make it...

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
It's all right! Now let's move forward

11
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,700
with the sun always in our hearts

12
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,100
As power passes through our clasped hands

13
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,680
let's grab hold of our wishes

14
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:17,780
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

15
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

16
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,960
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:39,050
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

18
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,560
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

19
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

20
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,440
And if you get into a jam

21
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I'll always be there to protect you

22
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,690
It's all right! Now let's move forward

23
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,200
with the sun always in our hearts

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,320
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,700
and gaze at the light beyond

26
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,420
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

27
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

28
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,090
So let's grab hold of our wishes

29
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,510
under the same flag-- together, we're one

30
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,850
One Piece

31
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:43,070
"Sanji Barges In! Sea Train Battle in the Storm!"

32
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,470
Ow... Seriously, what's that man thinking?!

33
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,550
No matter what he's thinking,
that train was for Government use,

34
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,730
so he'll get caught and it'll all be over for him.

35
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,180
Hm? That's Galley-La's... Paul...

36
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,690
Don't be thoughtless!

37
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,450
It looks like there's something
going on between them.

38
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:16,980
Hm?

39
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,550
Train stations are a place for
people to meet or part ways!

40
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,690
As station employees, we should
quietly watch over them, right?!

41
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh, that's right.

42
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,140
Quietly, got that?

43
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,500
Yeah, quietly.

44
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,340
The train left quite a bit early, huh?

45
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,890
What?!

46
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,880
Ah, yes.

47
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,180
All the passengers were already here, so...

48
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,660
Also...

49
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,300
...the sea started getting
rougher than we thought.

50
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,670
At this rate, we thought Aqua
Laguna would come very soon,

51
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,730
so we moved up the departure time.

52
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,950
This place is dangerous, too.

53
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,970
You should evacuate to
the shipbuilding island soon.

54
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,160
That lady, too.

55
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,860
Yeah...

56
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,200
Hey, you... Once the train
has left, we can't stop it.

57
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,510
It's not easy to say this,

58
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,970
but this Enies Lobby place is...

59
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,620
Are you crying?

60
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,630
Um... well, I do understand how you feel, but...

61
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,880
We're gonna go after them!

62
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,890
Oh, she was angry!

63
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,560
Those idiots from the Government!
They're not gonna get away with this!

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,580
Hey, let us borrow a ship!

65
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,250
What's with you, all of a sudden?

66
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,560
A huge and strong ship!

67
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,350
Are you trying to sail out
when the sea is like this?!

68
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,000
You idiot!

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,200
Don't say such stupid stuff when you
don't know how awful Aqua Laguna is!

70
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,610
We will make it through!

71
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,590
This is a whole other level from the
type of storm surge you're thinking of.

72
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,630
The sea will now get terribly rough!

73
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,870
You can no longer sail out! If you did,
you'd basically be sailing to your deaths!

74
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,130
But Robin, too, laid down her life for us and...

75
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,100
That was close...

76
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,320
Th-Thanks...

77
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,260
Paulie-san! Thank you very much!

78
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,720
We almost got dragged into the sea.

79
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,120
Look at that. That big schedule
board got torn apart by a wave.

80
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,280
Nothing like this has ever happened before.

81
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,230
What's with the power of this ebbing?

82
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,490
It's already this strong
when it's only approaching?

83
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,120
The speed of the waves of
this Aqua Laguna are abnormal.

84
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,340
Hey... Is the sea train Robin is on okay?

85
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,410
It'll probably get through the stormy
area right before the storm surge hits.

86
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,420
Unless it gets hit directly, it'll make
it through most of the big waves.

87
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,440
Hey, are you Nami?

88
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,310
Hm?

89
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,760
An inconspicuous letter
was left in the station plaza.

90
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,500
It's probably from one of your friends.

91
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,900
A letter...? From whom?

92
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,650
I'm surprised that you found such a small thing.

93
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,300
Here! It was left here in
an inconspicuous manner.

94
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,830
"Nami-san! Please read this!
(Those other than Nami-san don't
have to read it, since they're idiots.)"

95
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,830
That idiot...!

96
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,000
What does it say?

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,010
Hmm... hold on a sec. The first half
is just a pointless love letter, so...

98
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,320
She said it's a love letter.
The third man has appeared.

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,920
No... Judging from the situation,
the third man is actually...

100
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,560
Hm? Why are you looking at me like that?

101
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,260
Here is the important part.

102
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:35,700
P.S. Since I saw Robin-chan on the
11 o'clock train, I'll get on board, too.

103
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,830
What?! Sanji-kun got on that train?!

104
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,240
And... Usopp?!

105
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,830
Also, a big thug with a ducktail... Who's that?

106
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,330
There's no one like that except Franky.

107
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,540
Right, there's no one else.

108
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,450
The fourth man... And to think
that the fifth man is Franky...

109
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,020
Poor Paulie-san...

110
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,040
Maybe it'd be better if he flatly gives up...

111
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,780
What's with you guys?!

112
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,690
Um... also, this was with that letter.

113
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,610
There should be at least one
transponder snail in the sea train.

114
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,450
So I'll get in touch with you as soon as I can.

115
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,580
I want you to always keep this portable
transponder snail I got in town with you.

116
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,550
That's right. Think of it as
your dear beloved San--

117
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,580
I see. So he'll call this one.

118
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,200
Then he foresaw where Nico Robin
was going to be? That's amazing!

119
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,340
"Nami-san! Please read this!
(Those other than Nami-san don't
have to read it, since they're idiots.)"

120
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,340
Yeah!

121
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,640
For the time being, Robin has Sanji-kun.

122
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,980
We'll definitely go to Enies Lobby, too!

123
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,160
Geez... I can't even have a smoke here.

124
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,190
Is that right?! So Sanji went
to the station after that?

125
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,830
Yep!

126
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,590
Usopp is on the same train, too. I'm glad...

127
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,030
So, anyway, no matter what means
we take to follow the sea train,

128
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,270
we can't do anything unless
we find Luffy and Zoro first.

129
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,060
Okay, got it!

130
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,460
I'm not mistaken about the direction
they flew to. So search those areas.

131
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,250
Everyone, please help us out!

132
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,190
Guys! We're counting on you!

133
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,680
Yeah!

134
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,360
Leave it to us!

135
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,130
Now, how should I quietly infiltrate?

136
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,870
Whoa! What a crazy storm outside!

137
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,300
Collier Shoot!

138
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,060
Who are you?!

139
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
Ahhh!

140
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,380
Hold it.

141
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,260
Where do you think you're going?

142
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,130
Don't move!

143
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,760
I saw his kick earlier.

144
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,440
He's no ordinary civilian!

145
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
If you say...

146
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,850
...something like that so openly...

147
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,110
...you'll make me blush.

148
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,080
That wasn't a compliment!

149
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,190
He's mocking us!

150
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,440
Hey! Let Lucci-san know that
a suspicious man infiltrated!

151
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,950
Wait!

152
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,070
This isn't something that
we need to bother CP9 with.

153
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,230
No matter how violent the suspicious man is,

154
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,890
there's no need to fear, because in this car...

155
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,760
Whoa! It's smoky!

156
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,640
...you've got me!

157
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,140
Jerry-san!

158
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:43,940
I'm a champion on a South Blue
island where karate is popular.

159
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,030
That's right. I'm a boxing champion!

160
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,660
Then, do karate.

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,540
You can make a comment like
that after you see my punches.

162
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,230
That's cruel!

163
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,970
Jerry... Aurora Flicker... Jab!

164
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,480
J-Jerry-san! The enemy is behind you!

165
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,100
Hm? He escaped?

166
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,220
Hey, kid! Just because I'm so tall,

167
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,620
don't think that I'm at a
disadvantage in this small car.

168
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,860
This is the first time I've been warned
by someone from between their legs.

169
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,980
My boxing rather puts me at
an advantage in a narrow space.

170
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,490
This is a yoga style!

171
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,110
Yoga one, two! One, two!

172
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,990
Your reach has gotten shorter!

173
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,370
So I made it look like, and then...

174
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,150
Screw...

175
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,520
...Drop Kick!

176
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,310
Now you're ignoring the rules of boxing?!

177
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,050
This is a waste of time.

178
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,800
Brochette!

179
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,860
First, the one who leads Government
officials in car #7, the very last car, is...

180
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,130
In order of increasing strength,

181
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,110
the one who leads forty
marines in car #5 is T-Bone,

182
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,320
a Navy Headquarters'
Captain and former knight.

183
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,750
Next, the one standing by in car #4 is Wanze,
a martial artist from Cipher Pol No. 7,

184
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,560
who is also the head steward on this trip.

185
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,060
And the one standing by in car #3 is
Mr. Nero, the newest member of CP9.

186
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:53,680
Anyway, though we are escorting criminals,
there's no possibility of a raid.

187
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,620
But just in case, we have military
power ready in each car, so...

188
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,870
Straw Hat!

189
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,390
Roronoa!

190
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,300
We're on your side! Come out!

191
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,970
Straw Hat! Where are you?!

192
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,540
Foreman! It must be hard even to move, right?
Why don't you take a little break?

193
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,690
Idiot! This is nothing.
Hurry up and find those two!

194
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,440
Yes, sir!

195
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,490
Did someone let Iceberg-san
know what's going on?

196
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,400
Two men went to give a report to him.

197
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,190
Where are you going? Iceberg-san...

198
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,330
Roronoa!

199
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,920
Straw Hat! Answer if you hear us!

200
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,880
Luffy!

201
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,630
Zoro! Where are you?!

202
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,890
Food... you say?

203
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,240
That's right. I want meat! Meat!

204
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,060
I want you to bring all the
meat you can gather. Hurry up!

205
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,540
But why are we being slave-driven like this?

206
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,800
No, this isn't for that girl.

207
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,760
Let's do our best for Paulie-san,

208
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,200
who's devoted to her even after being dumped!

209
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,740
Yeah!

210
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,340
In any case, she must be really hungry.

211
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,650
She's a growing girl, I bet!

212
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,270
This one, too. There really
aren't any stores open right now.

213
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,550
Oh, that's right. How about the kitchen
at the station's employee dining hall?

214
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,620
We can't take the backstreets.
I bet the area is already flooded.

215
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,030
Then we have no choice but
to search this area, right?

216
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,080
--But--
--Let's go!

217
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,560
You think that girl would forgive us
if we went back empty-handed?!

218
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,290
Rain...

219
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,540
This isn't good.

220
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,630
When the strong winds are already
interfering with my sense of smell...

221
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,180
Say, we've been calling out this much,
and yet there's no answer.

222
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,420
Could it be...

223
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,450
Stop saying stupid stuff! We'll just do our best!

224
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,560
Where are you guys? Luffy... Zoro...

225
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,870
You guys wouldn't be taken out
by a leopard man like that, right?

226
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,080
We finally know why Robin left us.

227
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,000
Where are you, Straw Hat?!

228
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,290
Answer us!

229
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,740
Just wait, Robin.

230
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,970
I'm coming to rescue you with
Luffy and the others without fail!

231
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,330
Hey, what's the matter?!

232
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,610
Ah, Paulie-san! Please take a look!

233
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,540
The more the water ebbs,

234
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,720
the bigger the returning wave becomes.

235
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,040
If you see how the tide ebbs,
you can tell the scale of the storm surge.

236
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,010
I'm being blown away!

237
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,090
Now, if we try to see how much lower
the water level goes this year...

238
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,010
Look at that, Chimney.

239
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,350
Whoa! This is incredible!

240
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,350
The sea looks as if it dried up.

241
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:05,490
Even I haven't seen a sight
like this in the past few decades.

242
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,740
Can the tide ebb this much?

243
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,460
I've never seen something like this before.

244
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,470
Just how big of a wave is coming this time?

245
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,880
The backstreets are gonna
be completely swallowed up.

246
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,140
There aren't any people
in the backstreets, right?

247
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,430
If there are, they'll die instantly.

248
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,610
The roar of the sea... has stopped.

249
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,500
Oh?

250
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,590
Grandma! Look, look! There's something there!

251
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,830
Is that right?

252
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,420
There's something between two houses!

253
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,480
Hey! Look! Look!

254
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,420
Hmm...

255
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,070
Kokoro-san!

256
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,840
Oh, you're that pirate girl.

257
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,070
Ah! Pirate lady! Hey, look over there!
There's something there!

258
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,770
Something?

259
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,680
Just what is it you're going on about, Chimney?

260
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,450
Hey...

261
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,820
What's with this dried-up sea?!

262
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,940
Luffy...

263
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,440
Hm? That straw hat...

264
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,980
Isn't that your King of the Pirates?

265
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,910
Right?

266
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,160
That idiot!

267
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,830
Hey! Where are you going?!

268
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,980
Don't go down to the backstreets!

269
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,760
Backstreets?! Hey, someone! Stop that woman!

270
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,680
Do you wanna lose your life?!

271
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,640
Aqua Laguna is already coming! Come back!

272
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,360
We had a dream that day

273
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,180
Our belief in ourselves

274
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:47,260
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

275
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:56,610
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

276
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:06,860
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

277
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:15,470
In the end, we can all surely smile

278
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,750
Luffy! Luffy... Luffy!

279
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,630
Oh, hey, Nami! Well, I got completely
stuck when I got sent flying.

280
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,840
Listen! Robin was lying to us!

281
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,060
What? She was lying?

282
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,390
She sacrificed herself in order to protect us!

283
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,060
Let's go! We'll protect Robin!

284
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

285
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,150
"Nami's Soul Cries Out!
Straw Hat Luffy Makes a Comeback!"

286
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,420
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
