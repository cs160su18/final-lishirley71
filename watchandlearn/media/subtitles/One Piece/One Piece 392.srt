2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,820
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,750
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,000
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,640
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,210
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,800
Find it!

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,500
Luffy and company, realizing that
the Sunny will need to be coated

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,060
in order to reach Fish-Man Island
, their next destination,

51
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,690
stopped off at the Sabaody Archipelago.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,070
This is it!

53
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,480
Sabaody Archipelago!

54
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,650
At the seemingly enjoyable archipelago,

55
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,820
Luffy and company searched
for a coating craftsman...

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,910
...but they encountered world
nobles known as Celestial Dragons

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,580
and were witness to their
domineering behavior.

58
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,830
Damn it!

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,210
If only... If only it wasn't for this!

60
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,910
Honestly, now!

61
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,920
You're terrible at taking care of them!

62
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,380
You make me sick.

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,980
She's...!

64
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,050
Stop! Please!

65
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,020
Please! Just endure it!

66
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,690
That pirate could've easily
beaten that old man and lady!

67
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,560
So why...?!

68
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,220
Harm a Celestial Dragon

69
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,820
and a Navy HQ admiral will
lead an entire army here!

70
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,200
They share the Creators' blood!

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,490
Creators?

72
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,700
The twenty kings who created
the huge World Government organization

73
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,830
800 years ago!

74
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,370
Their descendents are
the Celestial Dragons.

75
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,620
And then a dark shadow
loomed toward Luffy and company...

76
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,520
Straw Hat Luffy.

77
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,500
300 million Berries.

78
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,420
"New Rivals Gather! The 11 Supernovas"

79
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,470
Gum-Gum...

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
...Pistol!

81
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,570
What's with this skeleton freak?!

82
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,390
Time to die!

83
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,750
Why, you!

84
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,620
Gavotte Bon en Avant!

85
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,540
Gotcha!

86
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,370
Watch out! He's quick as a monkey!

87
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,620
Damn! The others are strong, too!

88
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,730
In that case...

89
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,190
...I'll just take her hostage!

90
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,200
Oh no! Camie! Pappagu!

91
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,240
Alright! C'mere!

92
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,080
Gum-Gum...

93
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,490
...Bazooka!

94
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,820
Alright! You okay?

95
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,800
Thanks, Straw Hat.

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,410
Thanks, Luffy-chin!

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:08,840
Yeah!

98
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,940
Are you done beating yours up, too?

99
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,880
Indeed!

100
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,430
You guys really are amazing!

101
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm full!

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,810
I could take those guys
on any time and never lose!

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,430
Damn!

104
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,510
He's too strong!

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,630
300 million is too much
to handle after all!

106
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,830
There are so many big shots
on these islands right now, too...

107
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,700
Damn... Can't we bag at least one?

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
No, wait...

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
I think that girl might be a...

110
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,510
I just had a good idea!

111
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,060
What on earth is going on?

112
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,730
All these bounty hunters
suddenly appearing out of nowhere...

113
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,190
That makes three surprise attacks now!

114
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,690
"Navy Keep Out"

115
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't see any more taste-testing--

116
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,690
I mean, souvenir shops, either.

117
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,500
It's almost strange seeing shops
and streets without anyone around...

118
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,570
It's hard to believe
there's a coating craftsman here!

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,860
This is a big archipelago,

120
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,640
so there are always places
outside the government's watchful eye.

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,280
Marines can't go very far
into the interior, either.

122
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,710
Look here.

123
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,210
A map?

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,840
It shows all the different areas here,
divided into 10-grove sections.

125
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,020
None of it's set in stone or anything.

126
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,910
It's just how they are generally.

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,850
For example,
the area we've come through...

128
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,470
Your ship is docked at #40,

129
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,900
a tourism area filled
with souvenir shops.

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,200
And #30 is an amusement park area

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,600
centered around Sabaody Park.

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,660
Oh! #60 is a naval post

133
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,800
where the government comes and goes!

134
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,880
Yeah, #60 is like the front door,
you could say.

135
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,100
Then what area is this place?

136
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,050
Here?

137
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,130
We're in Grove #16 right now.

138
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,150
Most of #1 through #29
is a lawless area!

139
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,340
That's why there are
so many bounty hunters.

140
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,900
Couldn't you have told us sooner?!

141
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,260
And then Zoro and Sanji
could've come instead!

142
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,860
It's okay!

143
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,940
We're headed for #13, the next one over!

144
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,610
Chopper-chin!
You and Skeleton-chin were really cool!

145
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,960
That doesn't make me happy, you dumbass!

146
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm blushing so much
that my ears are red!

147
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,860
Though I have no ears,
because I'm a skeleton.

148
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,620
"Sabaody Archipelago - Grove #13"

149
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,950
All right! We're here!

150
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,330
We finally made it...

151
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,420
It's the shop on top of that root.

152
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,450
Is it still in business?

153
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,080
It's been 10 years now...

154
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,040
Hey, is the coating craftsman
a fish-man too?

155
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,130
Oh, Pappagu and I don't know him.

156
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,560
We heard he's incredible, though.

157
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,660
Oh? Really?

158
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,940
Well, we'll find out when we meet 'im!

159
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,330
"Shakky's Rip-Off Bar"

160
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,330
Shakky's Rip-Off Bar!

161
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,550
Hachi.

162
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,830
It really sounds like they intend
to rip you off at this place...

163
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,910
This craftsman isn't super-violent
by any chance, is he?

164
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,340
Don't worry!

165
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,040
They're nice people!

166
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,730
I've known 'em since I was little!

167
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,680
Hey, why are we going to a bar?!

168
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,430
Looks like they're still in business.

169
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,850
Rayleigh? Shakky?

170
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,270
"Bar Owner & Former Pirate
Shakuyaku (Shakky)"

171
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,530
Come on in.

172
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,690
What'll it be?

173
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,770
Oh?

174
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,520
Is that you, Hatchan?

175
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,680
Long time, no see!

176
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,370
It's good to see you again, Shakky!

177
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,270
Yes.

178
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,030
How long has it been? 10 years?

179
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,690
Have a seat for a second.

180
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,140
I was in the middle

181
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,860
of ripping these kiddos off
for an excessive amount.

182
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,710
Take your time.

183
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,100
It won't take long.

184
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,030
Oh?

185
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,050
You gave up being a pirate, Hatchan?

186
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,560
Yeah, a lot happened...

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,070
But that's okay.

188
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,180
After all, an honest
life is the best life.

189
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,210
Say, it's rare for merfolk
to be above water.

190
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,600
Are you Hatchan's girlfriend,
Camie-chan?

191
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,520
Eh?!

192
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,740
M-M-Me, Hatchan's wife?

193
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,460
I-I-It's too s-s-soon for...!

194
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,650
Jumpy much?

195
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,900
We run a takoyaki shop together.

196
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,260
Oh, really?

197
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,440
Oh, right.

198
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,830
Let me get you some drinks--

199
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,860
Shakky-san.

200
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,630
These boiled beans are delicious.

201
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,290
They're raiding the fridge!

202
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,080
Luffy! Brook! She's gonna rip you off!

203
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,470
It's okay. Go ahead.

204
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,100
Here, I have something you'll like.

205
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,300
Here.

206
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,260
Cotton candy!

207
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,130
Sweet! Yum!

208
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,560
Okay, that'll be 100,000 Berries.

209
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,270
I... I... don't have that much...

210
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,630
I'm sorry. I was only teasing.

211
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,800
I can't charge friends of Hatchan.

212
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,610
Really?!

213
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,640
Lady.

214
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,450
How do you know what Chopper likes?

215
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,600
You're Monkey-chan's group, correct?

216
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,660
You know about me?!

217
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,960
Of course.

218
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,680
Everyone's talking about you.

219
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,460
Plus I stay well-informed.

220
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,700
Wow!

221
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,080
You're famous, Luffy-chin!

222
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,160
But I had no idea
you had a skeleton on your crew

223
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,380
or that skeletons could
even move about, though.

224
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, pardon my late introduction.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,900
I am the dead and skeletonized Brook.

226
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,310
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

227
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,950
Nice to meet you.

228
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,180
Oh, look at how much you've dropped...

229
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,070
Shakky-san...

230
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,180
What a delightful person!

231
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,900
What color are your panties?

232
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,130
Why're you asking that?!

233
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,260
Let me think... I believe today's are...

234
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,870
Don't tell him!

235
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,550
Oh, my! How incredible!

236
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,700
My nosebleed won't stop!

237
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,840
I have no nose, though! Kaboom!

238
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,860
Here you are!

239
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,930
Thanks!

240
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,900
I read your news stories.

241
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,520
How much of the Enies Lobby
incident is true?

242
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,350
Is it true you picked a fight
with the government?

243
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,610
Forget about that.

244
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,370
It's too much of a pain to explain.

245
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,190
You're not going to brag?
You really are a big-shot...

246
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,070
That reminds me...

247
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,660
You have the same name
as someone in the navy named Garp.

248
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,370
Yeah. He's my grandpa.

249
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,260
I thought so.

250
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,030
Garp once chased me a long time ago.

251
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,620
How come?

252
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,730
Shakky used to be a pirate.

253
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,330
Really?

254
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,000
I washed my hands of it
40 years ago, though.

255
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,530
Wait! How old are you, lady?!

256
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,640
Nowadays I have fun
cheering on rookies like you.

257
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,970
Anyway, Shakky...

258
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,880
No, don't say it.

259
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,350
I know. I know everything.

260
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,290
You guys came all this way by land

261
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,030
to help Monkey-chan's group
get their ship coated here, right?

262
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,960
That was good!

263
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,730
Here you go!

264
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,570
So basically,
you have a coating job for Rayleigh?

265
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,930
That's right.

266
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,900
He isn't here, though.

267
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,620
Eh?!

268
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,370
The craftsman isn't here?!

269
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,750
We wanna go to Fish-Man Island!

270
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,580
Well, seeing as he wouldn't
leave this archipelago,

271
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,850
why don't you check around
some pubs or gambling houses?

272
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,570
We'll just wait 'til he gets back, then.

273
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,680
Yes, he'll be back eventually.

274
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,750
He's been gone half a year now, though.

275
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
Half a year?!

276
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,030
He's probably shacked up
with some girls he's picked up,

277
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,270
so I'm not worried about his wellbeing.

278
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,560
Maybe it's the former pirate in him

279
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,870
that keeps him away for
so long once he leaves.

280
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,500
The old craftsman guy
was a pirate, too?!

281
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,840
That's right.

282
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,300
This is a real problem for us, though.

283
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,410
If he's not here, then our only option
is to go look for him.

284
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,340
Do you know where he might be?

285
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,960
Hmm...

286
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,260
He's probably somewhere in #1 to #29,
if I had to guess...

287
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,500
Groves #1 through #29...

288
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,760
That's the lawless territory!

289
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,460
He's notorious, too.

290
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,440
He can't relax with the
navy keeping watch...

291
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,400
And let's see...

292
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,600
Another area he's fond of
is Sabaody Park.

293
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,910
The amusement park?!

294
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,740
Alright! Let's look there!

295
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,410
--Yahoo!
--Yay! Amusement park!

296
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,620
Camie! Stop that!

297
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,930
Amusement park! Amusement park!

298
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,500
In any case, be careful,
wherever you end up looking.

299
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,590
According to my information network,

300
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,470
including you, there are now 11 people
on the Sabaody Archipelago

301
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,410
whose bounties exceed
100 million Berries.

302
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,690
11 people with bounties
over 100 million?!

303
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,800
Amusement park! Amusement park!

304
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,090
In any case, be careful,
wherever you end up looking.

305
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,080
According to my information network,

306
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,430
including you, there are now 11 people
on the Sabaody Archipelago

307
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,570
whose bounties exceed
100 million Berries.

308
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,740
11 people with bounties
over 100 million?!

309
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,370
Yes.

310
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,580
Excluding Monkey-chan and Roronoa-chan,
that still leaves nine.

311
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,970
When you entered the Grand Line,

312
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,560
you chose one of seven routes

313
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,320
and followed your Log all the way here.

314
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,510
Yeah.

315
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,580
So, naturally, there are others

316
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,320
who took one of the six other routes
and had to overcome many difficulties

317
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,280
similar to yours to get here.

318
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,620
All routes run into the Red Line,

319
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,060
so everyone gathers on this
archipelago to cross that wall.

320
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,790
Understand?

321
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,370
It's not every day
that so many of the world's rookies

322
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,860
all show up at the same time, though...

323
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,760
Especially Kid, Luffy,

324
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,290
Hawkins, Drake, Law...

325
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,800
These names showed up
in newspapers all the time.

326
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't read newspapers.

327
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,190
Information is a weapon.

328
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,380
Shouldn't you at least learn
the names of your rivals?

329
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,320
Let's see... Kid, Hawkins, and...

330
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,430
Drake, was it?

331
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,300
In terms of bounty amounts...

332
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,140
you'd be #2.

333
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,420
There's someone worth more than Luffy?!

334
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,400
On these islands?!

335
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,400
"Grove #24 - Restaurant"

336
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,250
Look at her eat!

337
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,130
Where does all the food go?!

338
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,540
Bring more food!

339
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,420
Vulgar woman...

340
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,970
She's ruining my meal.

341
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,850
Go shut her up.

342
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,060
That's not a good idea, Father!

343
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,230
Navy Headquarters is just
a stone's throw away!

344
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,230
If we were to cause a scene now...!

345
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,860
"From West Blue Captain
of the Firetank Pirates"

346

A 138 million Berry bounty.

348
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
Where's my seconds?!

349
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,130
Bring it now!

350
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,620
T-They said they're working
as hard as they can, Captain.

351
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,250
It's not fast enough!

352
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,880
More pizzas!

353
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:43,350
"From South Blue Captain
of the Bonney Pirates"

354

355
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,350
A 140 million Berry bounty.

356
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,590
I'll bring it right away!

357
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,940
I-I'm very sorry!

358
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,760
Why, you little...!

359
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,360
Stop.

360
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,860
Why, Captain?!

361
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,160
He got spaghetti all over my clothes!

362
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,290
Such was the fate of those clothes.

363
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,220
I apologize for scaring you.

364
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,040
Taking a life on this particular day
will only diminish fortuity.

365
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:20,680
"From North Blue Captain
of the Hawkins Pirates"

366
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,830

367
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,680
A 249 million Berry bounty.

368
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,180
Who's the guy with the stupid face?

369
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,620
Oh, that'd be Sea Roar.

370
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,570
Boss!

371
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,740
What's going on?! A fight?!

372
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,490
If you want a fight,
let's save it for the other side!

373
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,090
Or do you not know how strong I am?

374
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,930
"From Grand Line (Longarm Tribe)
Captain of On Air Pirates"

375

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,930
A 198 million Berry bounty.

377
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,600
Then quit yer damn starin'.

378
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,480
Boss! Don't!

379
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,620
Damn, you're one creepy bastard.

380
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,770
I can get rid of you
right now, if you'd like!

381
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:24,570
"From South Blue

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,520
If you wanna go wild...

387
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,180
...do it in the New World!

388
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:06,860
"From North Blue

389
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,310

A 222 million Berry bounty.

391
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,870
I see.

392
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,790
Drake, the fallen navy officer...

393
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:22,130
"From Sky Island

394

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,050

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:34,310
"From South Blue

398
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,460

A 162 million Berry bounty.

400
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,280
Things were just getting good, too...

401
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,530
Drake-ya...

402
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,820
How many people have you killed?

403
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:56,580
"From North Blue

404
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,030

A 200 million Berry bounty.

406
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,340
A countless number of pirates
have entered the Grand Line,

407
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,480
but only a countable few
have made it this far.

408
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,630
The Grand Line is a lot like
an enormous survival tournament.

409
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,860
Those pirates who've made it
this far through each route alive

410
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,440
are truly the cream of the crop.

411
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,450
One of them

412
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,630
might even usher
in the next generation of pirates.

413
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,920
In any case,

414
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,960
with so many rookies here
all at the same time,

415
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,330
things are going to get ugly
in the New World.

416
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,500
Also, as for why Captain Kid's
bounty is higher than yours...

417
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,940
It's because he causes
serious harm to civilians.

418
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,300
Not very charming, is he?

419
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,300
That's why I'm behind you guys 100%.

420
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,250
Well, for now...

421
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,440
I just wanna have fun!

422
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,070
But I'm worried about
the old craftsman guy,

423
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,150
if he's in such a rough town.

424
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,820
My husband will be fine.

425
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,870
After all, he's 100 times
stronger than you kids...

426
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,380
100...

427
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,430
...times?

428
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,420
Right! We're gonna go find the old coating guy!

429
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Yeah!

430
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,930
Oh! It's the Sabaody Park!

431
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,740
Let's try looking here for him!

432
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,020
Yeah! He might be hiding in the ferris wheel!

433
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,960
Alright, let's have fun!

434
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,230
You're not trying to find him!

435
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

436
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,750
"The Target is Camie!! The Looming
Clutches of a Professional Kidnapper"

437
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,010
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
