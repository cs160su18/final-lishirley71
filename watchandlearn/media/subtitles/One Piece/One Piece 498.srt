2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,280
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,320
Luffy made it to the Maiden Island

61
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,510
where he was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

62
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,930
There is, however, an untold
story of the brothers...

63
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,210
...10 years ago in the East
Blue - Luffy and Ace as boys.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,590
Luffy has been left with Dadan -
the mountain bandit of Mt. Corvo

65
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,010
and met 2 precocious kids named Ace and Sabo

66
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,720
with whom he pledged to be brothers forever.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,100
Our brotherhood will always be with us!

68
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,700
So from now on,

69
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,960
we're brothers!

70
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,740
Yeah!!

71
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,430
I'm gonna become a pirate before
you do so just forget it.

72
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,750
That's not fair! I'm gonna
become a pirate first!

73
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,960
You're still saying a crap like that?!

74
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,670
Can't you both understand that
you must become Navy soldiers?!

75
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,680
"We will stand on our feet."

76
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,130
This is nice!

77
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,910
Yeah, it's great!

78
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,070
This is our hideout!

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,630
Here they are!

80
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,910
"Luffy Becoming an Apprentice?! A Man Who
Fought Against the King of the Pirates!"

81
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,960
Seasons come and go and now it's winter.

82
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,930
Sabo! He's coming to you!
Don't let him get away!

83
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,470
Okay! I won't!

84
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,890
Yes! We drove him to the bay!

85
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,360
Luffy! Get ready!

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,690
Here he is!

87
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,050
Let's go!

88
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,830
You can't get away!

89
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,690
Yes! I got him!

90
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,520
Good job, Luffy!

91
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
We got two of them today!

92
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,390
We can have a lot of danpa soup!

93
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,190
Yeah!

94
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,130
I did it! I did it! I did it!

95
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,830
I made a kill for the first time! Yeah!

96
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,960
Hey, look!

97
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,130
Luffy, watch your back!

98
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,420
Back?

99
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,300
A big tiger!

100
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,330
He caught wind of our prey!

101
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,920
Luffy, get away from there!
He just wants the danpa!

102
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,480
That's my prize! I'm not gonna let you...

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,050
...h-h-have it!

104
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,080
He's too tough for you! Get away now!

105
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,000
No! Go away, stupid!

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,460
Otherwise, I'm gonna beat you up!

107
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,910
--That fool!
--Luffy!

108
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,760
You bastard! Gum-Gum...

109
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
You bastard...

110
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,490
Gum-Gum...

111
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,740
Wait, wait, wait!

112
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,580
Let's run while he's distracted!

113
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,490
Okay!

114
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,500
I'll get even with you!

115
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,640
Sorry about your first prize.

116
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,430
Leave him alone. We had no
chance against that tiger.

117
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,650
But that was my prize!
He can't just steal it!

118
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,650
Y-Y-You fool! Don't shake it!

119
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,910
--You little...!
--Stop, Luffy!

120
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,890
Sabo! Pull us up now!

121
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,020
I-I got it!

122
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,890
Sorry!

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,150
We're home finally! Let's just
go to bed on such a bad day

124
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,030
Go to bed on a bad day?

125
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,570
Oh, I'm starving!

126
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,830
--It's your fault!
--Ouch!

127
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,250
But if someone steals the prize you
caught by yourself for the first time,

128
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,560
I can see why someone would get angry.

129
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,960
--But it's reckless to fight such a big tiger...
--That's something you would do!

130
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,760
Humph! Shut up!

131
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,450
It's great to have brothers!
If they come aboard my ship...

132
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,130
Captain, you keep out of this!

133
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,670
Leave it to us!

134
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,880
No, I'll fight too because I'm a captain!

135
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,930
Why are you laughing?

136
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,640
That's not gonna make your stomach full.

137
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,350
I made up my mind!

138
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,110
Ace! Sabo! You guys gotta come
aboard my ship! Okay? Say yes!

139
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,650
That's so sudden!

140
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,200
We decided to leave it to the future.

141
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,740
But it'd be fun to be with each other

142
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,200
and you'll need my help, won't you?

143
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,330
You're the one who needs help, aren't you?

144
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,170
Yeah.

145
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,340
No!

146
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,130
I'm gonna help you!

147
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,170
You guys are welcome to come aboard my ship.

148
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,590
--No, my ship!
--No, my ship!

149
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,640
Then, this is not gonna work.

150
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,770
--Are you sure about it?
--Yeah.

151
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,970
Sabo?

152
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,350
I'm not gonna work for anyone. Forget it.

153
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,160
Come on! It's gonna be fun!

154
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,250
Oh yeah! How about this?

155
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,360
The one who beats the big
tiger can be the captain!

156
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,740
The big tiger? Are you serious?

157
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,750
The chances of you becoming
a captain are pretty low.

158
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,710
That's not true! None of us
can compete against him now!

159
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,590
--Good idea!
--Good idea!

160
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,260
Yeah! Let's do it!

161
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,920
--Alright!
--Alright!

162
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,890
Are you ready?

163
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,020
Yeah!

164
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,230
We went through so much to
catch these. What a waste!

165
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,650
Don't complain. We caught
these to use them as bait.

166
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh? There he comes!

167
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,890
What a greedy bastard!
He can't have them today!

168
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,170
He's here!

169
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,030
Is that the tiger?

170
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,350
What?! It's a bear!

171
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,690
That's not what we expected!
Go away! Shoo! Shoo!

172
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,020
Wait, it seems like he's
as strong as the tiger.

173
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,820
We can't beat the tiger if we can't beat him.

174
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,910
I see! So he's perfect for practice.

175
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,660
--I go first!
--That's not fair!

176
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,870
That's cheating!

177
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,860
Oh no! He's not cooling off!

178
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,620
He's gonna kill us!

179
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,020
W-Who is it?!

180
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,190
He better run - that old man!

181
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,860
That's Naguri from Gray Terminal!

182
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,600
Run! He's coming to you!

183
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,460
What're you doing, old man?!

184
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,630
You know that you don't belong here!

185
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,660
Go back to the forest now!

186
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,630
Cool!

187
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,390
It's like that time before!

188
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,330
What?! You were a pirate
and a captain, Naguri?!

189
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,590
Yes, indeed.

190
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:51,780
I knew it! Only a pirate
captain could do that!

191
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,880
"That"?

192
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,520
You made the big bear turn away
just by staring at him like Shanks!

193
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,730
You're cool, old man!

194
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,560
You think so?

195
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,200
I can't believe that Naguri
was a pirate because...

196
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,910
He's always collecting junk, hammering
away at them all day long,

197
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,620
making weird stuff,

198
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,530
and getting teased by the people

199
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,640
at the Gray Terminal and by Bluejam's crew.

200
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,880
He looked pathetic.

201
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,510
You know nothing, Sabo!
That's how pirates are!

202
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,640
You don't know anything, either!

203
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,850
What do you know about pirates?!

204
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,940
I know pirates! Shanks doesn't
do needless killings!

205
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,640
Shanks, again.

206
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,480
Hey, it's cooked.

207
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,820
--Ow, ow, ow...!
--Ouch!

208
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,860
Oh, you got more than me!

209
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,980
You got to pay attention.

210
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,160
Have some, Naguri. You helped us.

211
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,520
Oh, thank you.

212
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,210
So, what is a pirate captain
doing in a place like this?

213
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,920
How could you ask me that?

214
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,300
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

215
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,760
No, I'll tell you.

216
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,680
Do you guys know Gold Roger?

217
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,690
Roger?

218
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,400
I know him! He was the King of the Pirates!

219
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,360
We challenged Roger, the King
of the Pirates, to a fight!

220
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,320
Really?!

221
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,310
But we lost the fight and split up.

222
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,410
And everything just went downhill after that

223
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,320
and I ended up like this.

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,880
That's basically what happened.

225
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,480
But you fought with the King of
the Pirates, right? That's cool!

226
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,260
No, no, we were no match for him.

227
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,020
We got beaten badly.

228
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Oh really? Even you were no
match - that's how much he...

229
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,110
Yes. And not just Roger, his
crew was also very strong!

230
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,580
Most importantly, their teamwork
was in perfect coordination!

231
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,250
It was our honor to fight with them.

232
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,460
I see! I still have a long
way to go to become a pirate.

233
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,010
Are you interested in pirates?

234
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,390
--I'm gonna become one!
--Become a pirate?

235
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,730
Yes, a pirate! Oh yeah, old pirate
man, could you give me some tips?!

236
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,830
I want to get stronger!

237
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,230
I have to become a captain
to lead Ace and Sabo!

238
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,820
A captain?

239
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,990
Hey, say yes! You're a pirate master!

240
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,740
--Okay!
--Okay?!

241
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,990
Yeah! Then, let's start from tomorrow!

242
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,250
Where did Ace go?!

243
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,040
Yeah, about that...

244
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,880
What?!

245
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,260
The King of the Pirates is his father?!

246
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,260
Yeah. But you can't tell anybody.

247
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,600
Don't mention it to Ace. He's gonna kill you.

248
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,970
Why?

249
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,850
I don't know why but he
doesn't like Roger for sure.

250
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,110
But that's his father, right?

251
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,770
So what?

252
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm sorry for both of you but I was
all by myself even if I had parents!

253
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,700
Oh yeah. Your parents...

254
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,290
Children don't always get
along with their parents.

255
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,460
But, what a shame! He's
the King of the Pirates!

256
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,240
I can understand that you
wanna ask him about Roger

257
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,960
but just don't, okay?

258
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,640
Uh-huh! I got it!

259
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,350
And... you too, Naguri.

260
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,910
Okay, I got it.

261
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,570
But I can't believe that
that boy is Roger's son...

262
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,360
There he is. Hey, just act casually.

263
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
Yeah.

264
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,160
--Don't mention...
--I know! Don't worry!

265
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,870
Oh, Ace! I didn't know that you were home!

266
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, Ace! I didn't know that
your father was Roger!

267
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,170
I knew he'd say it!

268
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,920
You idiot, Luffy! I told
you to not to mention it!

269
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,430
--Luffy!
--Yeah!

270
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,430
Who told you that?

271
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,390
Sabo told me!

272
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,600
Hey Ace, what was Roger like?!

273
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,480
No!

274
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,780
How stupid are you? Don't
just say it casually!

275
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,440
Let me go! I am acting casually.

276
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,450
--Ouch!
--Ouch!

277
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,120
Don't you ever mention
that name when I'm around!

278
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,830
Why did you hit me?!
Don't be mean - just tell me!

279
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,420
Give people a chance to explain first!

280
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,580
Shut up!

281
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,340
Tell us about him! You're so mean!

282
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,570
He's right! You can't have
a secret from your brothers!

283
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,680
Shut up! I don't care about my brothers!

284
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,520
Roger, Roger, Roger! Ace's father
is the King of the Pirates!

285
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,310
Shut up! Don't provoke him!

286
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,150
When you get down to it, it's
your fault for being a bigmouth!

287
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,440
Ouch! What did you say?!

288
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,820
What are you doing?!

289
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,580
We're no longer brothers from today!

290
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,150
--That's what I was gonna say!
--That's what I was gonna say!

291
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,500
Alright, I'm counting on you.

292
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,220
Yes, I'll leave no stone unturned.

293
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,930
You know what you should do.

294
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,890
We'll get to it!

295
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,600
Yeah, but if you find him,
don't do anything yet.

296
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
What?

297
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,940
Can't you see? We have to make
his father feel indebted to us.

298
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,240
The longer he worries, the more he'll
appreciate us when we find Sabo.

299
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,320
I see.

300
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,870
Until the time comes, don't do
anything - just monitor him.

301
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,710
"We will have a visit this spring"?

302
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,170
Dogra! Magra! Where is
the country called Goa?!

303
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,760
Mt. Corvo, Gray Terminal,
and Windmill Village

304
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,220
are part of Goa Kingdom supposedly.

305
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,720
That's what I thought.

306
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,770
Easy, easy, boss.

307
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:00,140
It's rare to see you reading a
newspaper. Hell must be freezing over.

308
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,600
Ouch!

309
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,140
Somebody's gonna visit the Kingdom?!

310
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,440
It's making the headlines...

311
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,150
What's going on here?
Are they that big a deal?

312
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,990
A CELESTIAL DRAGON WILL VISIT

313
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,460
These Celestial Dragons?

314
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,610
Curious after Luffy is taken in as an
apprentice, Ace and Sabo visit Naguri again.

315
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,180
Seeing that the boys only care about
getting strong enough to beat a tiger,

316
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,930
Naguri tells them that they can't become
pirate captains just by being strong.

317
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,440
What does it really take
to be a pirate captain?!

318
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

319
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
"The Battle against the Big Tiger!
Who is Going to be Captain?!"

320
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
