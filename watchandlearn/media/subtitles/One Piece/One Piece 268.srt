00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,720
Franky and Robin have been
taken to the Tower of Law.

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,600
I feel on top of the world!

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,100
I'm surprised to see you survived that
accident eight years ago, Cutty Flam.

5
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,190
Goals can't be achieved without sacrifice.

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,400
We're working in order to
ensure peace for all of humanity.

7
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,450
You're crazy!

8
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,370
Tom-san put his life on the line
to protect the blueprints

9
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,460
because idiots like you exist!

10
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,130
Yoi!

11
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,720
Around that time, Luffy was
fighting against 10,000 soldiers

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,930
on the main island of Enies Lobby.

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
Chief Spandam! Please come in!
Please advise us on countermeasures!

14
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,650
We can't stop Straw Hat Luffy!

15
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,090
Meanwhile, Zoro and the others,
who had been waiting on Rocketman

16
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,090
for the gates to be opened, charged in
after thorough preparation and...

17
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,430
What?! This is terrible!
We're gonna crash into the gate!

18
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,060
What're we gonna do?! What're we gonna do?!

19
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,600
--Dodge it, Kokoro-san!
--What're we gonna do?!

20
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,100
Don't worry. There's a way.

21
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,370
...they passed over the main gate

22
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,080
and headed straight to
the main island front gate.

23
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,600
Wh-Who are those two?!

24
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,490
Big bazooka unit, step forward!

25
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,160
I have to hurry up or Robin will...

26
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,000
I guess I'll try that thing.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,080
Just give up, Straw Hat!

28
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,000
Fire!

29
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,550
--Did we do it?
--He fell into the waterfall!

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,060
Hey, look! He's still clinging onto the edge!

31
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,400
Straw Hat! If you surrender
peacefully, we can pull you up.

32
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,610
Why would I?!

33
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,530
How stubborn! Fall into the waterfall already!

34
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,290
You bastard!

35
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,910
Hey, guys! Give me a foot here!

36
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,040
Yeah!

37
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,090
Hey, he went over to your side!

38
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,960
This way! This way!

39
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,470
I got lucky!

40
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,520
It's Straw Hat! Fire!

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,770
Boy, what a crazy place I wandered off into.

42
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,320
But since I was able to take care of a
lot of them at once, I guess it's okay.

43
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,650
If I remember right, I should move forward

44
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,910
towards that serious looking building, right?

45
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,660
--All right!
--He went that way! After him!

46
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,410
H-Heavy...

47
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,920
C-Climb up in order,
starting with those at the bottom!

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,380
Slowly, okay?! Slowly!

49
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,630
Don't shake!

50
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,010
It's not me! It was a wind gust!

51
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,050
It's just wind! Stop it with your willpower!

52
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,390
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,860
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

54
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,830
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

55
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,710
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

56
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,420
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

57
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,380
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,640
we will be able to make it through

59
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,890
Always!

60
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,610
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

61
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,570
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

62
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,740
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

63
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,200
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

64
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,580
We can't stop here

65
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Around the world

66
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,710
Start me up!

67
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,390
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

68
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,600
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,560
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

70
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,360
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

71
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Brand New World

72
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,910
Start me up!

73
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:44,040
"Catch Up with Luffy!
The Straw Hats' All-Out Battle"

74
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,890
H-Hey! I know who that swordsman is!

75
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,140
Yeah, he's one of Straw Hat's
underlings, Pirate Hunter Zoro!

76
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,890
They called you an underling.

77
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,480
Then, you're even lower
than that, right, "Pirate A"?

78
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,070
Huh?!

79
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,570
Then, "B."

80
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,110
Huh?! If I had a bounty, it'd be
at least twice as much as yours!

81
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,120
Then, "C."

82
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,080
Hey, listen to what I'm saying, you bastard!

83
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,870
Hey, stop it, you two.

84
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,660
Sogeking, they can't hear you.

85
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,910
This is part of my plan, Chopper-kun.

86
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,500
--Oh, I didn't know.
--Hm?

87
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,540
There are more of them in the train!

88
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,340
They found us!

89
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,050
There have to be more!
Blow it up before they come out!

90
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,430
Hey, hold it! Nami-san is still in there!

91
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,090
Fire!

92
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,520
Those bastards! I'm gonna
cut them into three pieces!

93
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,230
Hold on, Pirate A.

94
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,270
What?!

95
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,650
An attack like that isn't enough
to take someone like her out.

96
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,070
You're only "Pirate A" because you
don't get something as obvious as that.

97
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,360
You damn Moss Head!

98
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,700
Boy, that scared me!

99
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,960
Are you okay, Sogeking?

100
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I-I-I'm okay, Chopper-kun.

101
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,670
Stop firing!

102
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
What's the matter?

103
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,380
--Look at that!
--Hello!

104
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,590
Stop it! I'm a senior citizen!

105
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,310
I'm a child and here is a
small animal! We're weak!

106
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,610
The Straw Hat Pirates threatened me
and made me operate the train!

107
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,610
They did!

108
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,280
Who lets their hostages drink?

109
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,580
That was close! We almost
killed the hostages, too!

110
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,250
Of all people, to think that those
pirates took a senior, a child,

111
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,750
and a small animal hostage... How despicable!

112
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,250
Hm?

113
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,250
What's that?! That smoke looks like clouds.

114
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,800
Using cool balls and heat balls,

115
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,880
the moisture in the air is turned into clouds.

116
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,260
Nami-san! So you escaped the attack!

117
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,810
Hey, the cloud is getting bigger and bigger.

118
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,400
Grandma, Grandma. The cloud is getting bigger.

119
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,530
That cloud looks a little dangerous.

120
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,990
Chimney, Gonbe. Come this way.

121
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,910
It sure wasn't named the
"Perfect Clima Takt" for nothing.

122
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,870
It develops much bigger clouds now,
and it does it much faster too.

123
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,630
Now, I'm gonna see how
powerful its thunderbolt is.

124
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,420
That lady's gonna do something!
We might wanna get out of here!

125
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,300
Here it comes!

126
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,890
Thunderbolt... Tempo!

127
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,330
Grandma, Grandma. That's an
incredible thunderbolt, isn't it?

128
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,920
That girl is something else.

129
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,340
Grandma, are we gonna be
okay under this umbrella?

130
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,170
Trust me. You'll be fine as long as you're here.

131
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:29,940
Nooo!

132
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,360
It's attacking everyone! We'll die, too!

133
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,110
Ahh! Sogeking!

134
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,780
Why'd you hit Sogeking, Nami?!

135
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,940
Don't worry about it.

136
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,530
D-Don't take it out on me.
The problem lies in how you're using it.

137
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,950
Besides, Usopp-kun says that he
doesn't remember adding that feature!

138
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,910
At any rate...

139
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,170
...that thing is crazy powerful!
You brought down a bunch of them.

140
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,420
--Ah...
--Hey, Nami!

141
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,300
What the hell did you do that for?!

142
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,220
Apologize to him, Sogeking!

143
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,100
You apologize, idiot!

144
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Nami-san! That reminded me of the
shock I had the first time I met you!

145
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,480
What's with those pirates?

146
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,980
I thought that girl was here just
for support, but she sure can fight.

147
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,820
Looks like it's over.

148
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,900
Pirate lady, you're incredible!

149
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,320
Looks like you guys're okay, too, Granny!

150
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,580
It's no accident that I've lived
for several decades, you know!

151
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,170
By the way, where's that idiot
who rushed out by himself?

152
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,220
Beats me... This island isn't small,
so if we are to find him...

153
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,760
What was that?!

154
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,300
That's definitely where he is!

155
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,640
Well, then...

156
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,770
...let's go after him, shall we?

157
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,570
They're mere pirates...
How dare they make a ruckus...?!

158
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,030
They won't get away with this!

159
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,470
Take this!

160
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,980
Gum-Gum... Spear!

161
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,660
He jumped onto the tree!

162
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,950
Those jerks! This is endless!
I can't move forward!

163
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,620
Hey, this way!

164
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,080
They're running in the opposite direction?!

165
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,840
Half of you guys, head to
the main island front gate!

166
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,630
Pirates broke open the gate and
are invading! Stop them at any cost!

167
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,760
They must be here! Good!
That makes things quite a bit easier!

168
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,140
All right!

169
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,600
Sorry, you missed!

170
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,940
He's over there! Fire!

171
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,860
If I remember right, it was this way, wasn't it?!

172
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,650
Hey, it wouldn't be good if you led the way.

173
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,650
Why not?!

174
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,030
It'll be fine if we go straight!

175
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,040
Seriously, that darn idiot!
He rushed out by himself, as usual!

176
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,500
Well, our sticking with that idiot
makes us quite the idiots as well.

177
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,960
But thanks to Luffy, it seems that the
marines are scattered for the time being.

178
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,800
So all we have to do now is
head straight to the courthouse!

179
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,260
Oh, no, my chronic disease is coming back...

180
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,130
If you wanna die, you can remain here.

181
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,300
--It's cured now!
--That's more like it.

182
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,020
Wh-What's the matter?

183
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,650
We have guests.

184
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,490
We Watchdogs are ordered
to guard the front gate!

185
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,080
No one can cross this line!

186
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,340
Just give up, you damn rogues!

187
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,590
Doggie policemen, this time?

188
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,850
Don't think that it's just us, pirates!

189
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,950
Looks like we're completely surrounded.

190
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,200
Now that I look a little closer,
there are too many enemies!

191
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,620
Now, the jig is up, pirates.

192
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,710
So what?

193
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,960
You sure are cocky! Guys, get them!

194
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,350
Grab hold!

195
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,790
Hey, you could've at least
let us have a little fun...

196
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,000
You idiot!

197
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,170
Don't forget why you came here.

198
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,420
This isn't where you should
be focusing your energy.

199
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,010
It's true that it'd take a whole
day to fight this many enemies.

200
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,600
They're quite energetic. Don't die, okay?!

201
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,720
Charge ahead!

202
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,020
Guards! Get back!

203
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,940
That's a King Bull from Water Seven!
Prepare the cannons immediately!

204
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,070
Dammit!

205
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,910
Take this!

206
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,660
We've got one more!

207
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,750
Watchdogs! Get back in formation!

208
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,960
Yeah!

209
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,010
We won't let you go!
Our dogs are faster than your fish!

210
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,760
This is bad! They're gonna try jumping on!

211
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,560
No way!

212
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,850
--Can't we go faster?!
--Hey, cook guy.

213
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,730
Hm?

214
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,360
What's the matter?

215
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,150
Take the reins.

216
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,110
Hm? You guys...

217
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,300
When you see... those guys, tell them...

218
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,260
"You guys're fired."

219
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,220
Sure will.

220
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,350
Jump onto it!

221
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,930
We won't let you!

222
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,730
We'll leave them to you, Galley-La!

223
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,440
We'll skewer you!

224
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Half Knot Air Drive!

225
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Ahhh! S-Some Watchdogs were taken out!

226
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Those fools! They let their guard down!

227
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,290
There's no way ordinary people
can match our speed. Go!

228
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,590
Yeah!

229
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,260
We'll pierce you before you notice!

230
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,560
More went down!

231
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,440
What's with them?!

232
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,280
They're strong!

233
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,660
We'll take care of these guys.

234
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,600
It seems that your temperament
hasn't changed at all, huh, Cutty Flam?

235
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,140
If I had realized sooner that you
were alive and had the blueprints,

236
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,520
I wouldn't have had to go
through all this trouble...

237
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:59,360
...since we could just have brought
you in for your past crimes!

238
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,660
On the contrary, your older fellow
disciple Iceberg was a hassle.

239
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,500
After Tom died,

240
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
he brought the shipbuilding
companies in Water Seven together

241
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,880
and organized a big company
by himself. And then,

242
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,670
he approached the World Government,
which he must've had a grudge against,

243
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,840
and soon his company established its position

244
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,510
as a purveyor to the World Government.

245
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,430
He's the president of the
shipbuilding company Galley-La

246
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,640
and the mayor of the
city of water, Water Seven.

247
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,860
After he became a figure
that everyone supported

248
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,900
and that was indispensable to the Government,

249
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,610
we couldn't meddle with him carelessly.

250
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,080
I heard that your company contracts to
build ships for the World Government!

251
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,580
Give me a break! I'm not gonna tolerate it!

252
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,830
So that's why he's been
contracting with the Government...

253
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,550
He was a smart man.

254
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,300
However, the winds started blowing in my favor.

255
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,470
Just when I couldn't wait any longer and
was about to take forceful measures...

256
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,890
...Admiral Aokiji sent me the good news...

257
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,360
...that Nico Robin was headed
to Water Seven on a pirate ship.

258
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,070
I drank a cup of coffee to calm myself down

259
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,040
and put all the conditions, including
Buster Call, into the plan of operations.

260
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,750
Well, there was a bit of change in the plans,

261
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:41,210
but look! Both triggers for the
ancient weapon's revival are here!

262
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:49,600
Do you get it? The winds the entire
world over are blowing in my favor.

263
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,530
A power strong enough to give me control
over any large country I might desire

264
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,820
is in my hands now!

265
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,780
Why did Aokiji give you the
authority to exercise Buster Call?

266
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,750
Huh?

267
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,900
You're in no position to ask me
questions, you insolent woman!

268
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,610
If I hadn't recognized
the value of your existence,

269
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,570
it would've been practically worthless!

270
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,070
So you should appreciate me!

271
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,000
You, the repugnant kin of Ohara,
the land of devils...

272
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Nico Robin...

273
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,180
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

274
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

275
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,220
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

276
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,230
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

277
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,520
We'll become No. 1

278
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

279
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,570
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

280
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,740
an era created by risking everything

281
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,860
We always try our best, let's go!

282
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,870
If we want to achieve glory,

283
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,280
now is the time--don't be afraid

284
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

285
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,170
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

286
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,130
We can take off with unknown powers

287
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,380
We don't fear, and we don't waver

288
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,180
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

289
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

290
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,100
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

291
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,350
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

292
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,360
Charge ahead

293
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,270
Let's start running towards tomorrow

294
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,240
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

295
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,500
Wait! That's not what we agreed upon!

296
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,290
What we agreed?

297
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,790
That the Straw Hats would
leave Water Seven safely!

298
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,130
That's right!

299
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:29,130
They left Water Seven safely...
and so, now, they're here, right?

300
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,090
No...

301
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,550
On the next episode of One Piece!

302
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,720
"Robin Betrayed! The Motive
of the World Government!"

303
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,220
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
