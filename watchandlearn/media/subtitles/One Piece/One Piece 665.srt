The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,100

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,560
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,820
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,860
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,300
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,280
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,930
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law

79
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,610
who's been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,580
I-I never imagined he'd be alive!

81
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,690
I'm asking you! Who is that person?!

82
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,850
M-My brother!

83
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,150
Ace was right!

84
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,760
We were always bonded together as brothers!

85
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,740
"A Burning Passion!
Rebecca vs. Suleiman!"

86
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,530
Suleiman keeps attacking Rebecca!

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,500
He even fended off her
Back-to-the-Water Dance!

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,990
Rebecca's struggling!

89
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,700
--Go!
--Go to hell, Rebecca!

90
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,440
Suleiman, chop her head off!

91
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,170
He was once a hero in the Dias Naval Battle

92
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,210
but after being exiled from
his country as a war criminal,

93
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,210
he became a grim reaper
walking on the dark side of the world!

94
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,840
SULEIMAN THE BEHEADER
A CLASS-A WAR CRIMINAL FROM THE DIAS NAVAL BATTLE

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,390
He has the lifeless bearing of a ghost!

96
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,950
I did everything for my country.

97
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,770
I used to love my country.

98
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,900
What about you?

99
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,880
--Part of that evil family!
--Drop dead, Rebecca!

100
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,980
When people hate you so,

101
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,580
it must be hard for you
to even breathe in this country.

102
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,010
I don't care how hard it is.

103
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,720
I don't mind being hated!

104
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,720
I just want to...

105
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,560
I just want to live together
with Soldier-san!

106
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,670
Rebecca!

107
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,350
She just won't give up!
Including the beautiful...

108
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,930
...I mean, hateful Rebecca,

109
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,210
there are only about 30 contenders left
in Block D!

110
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,210
One more person,
I mean, animal down!

111
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,500
ORLUMBUS - AN ADVENTURER
(AN ADMIRAL OF THE YONTA MARIA GRAND FLEET)

112
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,090
He defeated dozens of people

113
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,780
and let blood run on the ring

114
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,220
but now, the fighting lion Agyo has...

115
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,900
...been beaten by Orlumbus's whip!

116
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,370
--How strong!
--Admiral!

117
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,590
CAVENDISH - A PIRATE

118
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,620
Will one of the favorites win as expected?!

119
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,910
Or some dark horse?!

120
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,890
DAMASK - AN ARSONIST

121
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,690
MUMMY - A SORCERER

122
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,710
Only one winner can move to the finals!

123
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,210
The life of King Riku's granddaughter...

124
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,560
Who's gonna take it?!

125
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,530
Soldier-san, where are you now?

126
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,540
Don't die!

127
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,290
That's all I ask!

128
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,370
--Go to hell, Rebecca!
--Chop her up already!

129
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,240
Screw you, Rebecca!

130
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,140
It's gonna be fun
to turn those hisses and boos...

131
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,080
…into a big round of applause
with my own hands.

132
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,620
He's different from the others!
His swordplay is faster and deadlier!

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm gonna show the audience
a picture of your pretty face...

134
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,330
...after slicing it off!

135
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,770
Will Suleiman be the one
who finishes off Rebecca?!

136
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,270
Wh-What the...

137
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,320
Agilia has come to the defense of Rebecca!

138
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,590
Agilia-san!

139
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,930
Get out of my way, bitch!

140
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,110
Is she trying to let her partner get away?!

141
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,490
The crowd is now jeering loudly at Agilia!

142
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,820
Agilia-san!

143
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,040
You...

144
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,450
...must move to the finals...

145
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,590
...at any cost!

146
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,510
Okay?

147
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,420
Uh-huh!

148
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,870
I will behead you!

149
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,330
Suleiman the beheader is pressing Rebecca!

150
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,030
I wonder if Tra-guy is okay.

151
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,860
Luffy-dono!

152
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,760
What's wrong?

153
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,890
Zoro-dono is gone.

154
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,770
He was with us a few moments ago.

155
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,230
I can't believe him!
We didn't make a turn or anything!

156
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,540
Should we go look for him?

157
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,260
We don't have that much time!

158
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,950
Let's just go!

159
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,330
--He's gonna catch up with us at some point.
--I guess.

160
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,300
Where am I?

161
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,230
Why did you make a turn
when the others didn't!

162
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,310
What's that toy?

163
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,200
Somebody's coming!

164
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,770
A samurai-looking cat?
It's a samurai cat!

165
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,640
Oh, it's a samurai cat!

166
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,860
Interesting!

167
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,460
Damn!

168
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,960
The last thing I need now is annoying brats!

169
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,070
You're a toy now!

170
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:31,100
Don't cause any trouble with the Big Humans!

171
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,420
I know!

172
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, he has three swords!

173
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,030
They look so real!

174
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,280
Cool!

175
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,380
Don't touch my swords!

176
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,700
A-A cat punch!

177
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,200
This toy hit me!

178
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,180
Wh-What did he say?!

179
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,730
A toy hit a human?!

180
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,650
Call the police!

181
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,040
Somebody, call the police!

182
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,510
Stop! Hey, you toy there!

183
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,810
I'll shoot you if you don't stop!

184
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,980
Boy! I just patted his head a little!

185
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,790
Didn't I warn you?!

186
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,840
But you...

187
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,360
You really are a blockhead.

188
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,660
--Thank you very much!
--Wait!

189
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,970
Damn!

190
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,370
Luffy! Kin'emon!

191
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,190
Oh, Zoro!

192
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,800
Zoro-dono!
I'm glad that you're okay!

193
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,750
Oh! You have a Little Person there!

194
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,770
I'm gonna guide you
to the entrance of the palace!

195
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,090
Who are you?

196
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,080
Is she your friend, Zoro-dono?

197
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,190
Well, she's kind of my friend or...

198
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm Wicka, a member of the King
Riku Army's scouting unit!

199
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,830
Anyway, let's hurry up!

200
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,220
The operation is already underway!

201
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,380
UNDERGROUND DRESSROSA - THE BLACK TRADE PORT

202
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,110
What?!

203
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,860
Toy Soldier has gone already?!
I thought he's the commander!

204
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,670
As soon as we've finished Operation SOP,

205
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,040
he'll carry out a major task -
killing Doflamingo while he's off-guard!

206
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,330
So he's heading for the palace
along with some Tontatta people!

207
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,260
Good luck, Commander!

208
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,610
Yeah!

209
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,740
We have you, our hero - Usoland here!

210
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,390
Please take command of Operation SOP -
the plan to knock Sugar out!

211
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,930
Whaaat?!

212
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,040
Th-That's the most important part!

213
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,340
We're here now.

214
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,500
All the bridges underground are movable.

215
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,150
And that building in the distance...

216
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,970
...that looks like a sea anemone.

217
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,080
That's the Executive Tower
where our target Sugar is!

218
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,630
The Executive Tower, huh?

219
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,870
I wonder if we can get there safely.

220
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh no!

221
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,690
Hey, who is it?!
Are you goofing around?

222
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,460
They've found us! We're finished!

223
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,650
Hey, you two!
Which ship do you belong to?!

224
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,410
Well, I'm just... a passer-by!

225
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,110
We don't allow anybody getting off a ship
except for the brokers!

226
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,060
--Inhel!
--Okay!

227
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,000
Huh?! The fairies are here!

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,790
We've been robbed of all we have!

229
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,880
Tontatta Combat!

230
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,090
Tail Hammer!

231
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,800
Th-They've got wedged
into the ground!

232
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,110
Here is your change of clothes,
Usoland, Robiland.

233
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,060
I can't believe how quickly you think!

234
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,950
You drew their attention by acting scared!

235
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,580
It was all your plan, wasn't it?

236
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,890
In order for you two to sneak in,

237
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,950
it's better to disguise
yourselves as the enemies!

238
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,160
Y-Yeah, sort of!

239
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,980
By the way, are you all that strong?!

240
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,660
Yes! We can manage that!

241
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,070
But Noland's family can even

242
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,670
take down Sea Kings so
you must be way stronger!

243
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:44,170
What kind of monster do they think I am?!

244
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,680
However,

245
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,520
maybe we can pull it off
without me fighting!

246
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,630
All right, guys!
I, Usoland, am taking command now!

247
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,500
Our target is a girl!

248
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,170
Let's go frighten her out of her wits!
Follow me!

249
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,240
Yes, sir!

250
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,720
I mean...

251
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,840
You lead the way!

252
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,750
Let's get to the Executive Tower!

253
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,380
Yeah!

254
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,070
The Executive Tower
The Access Lift

255
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,070
The Palace
The Toy House
The Trade Port

256
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,070
The Factory

257
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,050
Get in now! We have an
intruder at the Toy House!

258
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,700
One of the Straw Hats is here!

259
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,690
He's fighting with Señor Pink-sama
at the east entrance!

260
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,160
He wants to get to the factory
on this floor!

261
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,370
Fraland!

262
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,190
If we take care of him,
they'll pay us a bonus!

263
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,670
--Really?! How much?!
--Well, we'll get a big reward for sure!

264
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,750
--Are you sure?!
--That's what they say!

265
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,700
Then, nothing's in writing yet!

266
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,970
If nothing is done,

267
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,160
we'll just keep going back and forth
between the Toy House and underground!

268
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,920
Let's take over the lift!

269
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,050
You all stay here!

270
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,660
Freeze! I'm taking over this lift!

271
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,900
He's the Lightning Soldier of the Colosseum!
How did he get here?!

272
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,030
Missed it!

273
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,930
You're too slow!

274
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,540
You bastard!

275
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,860
Too slow!

276
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,610
Too slow!

277
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,360
Soldier-san, you hit me!
That's domestic violence!

278
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,450
It's not domestic violence!
I don't want to hit you!

279
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,190
Then stop yourself before you connect!

280
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,970
You need a sense of crisis
to improve yourself!

281
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,770
You need to focus, Rebecca!

282
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,650
Humans' instincts are much better than that!

283
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,250
Let it all out!

284
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,640
Believe in your human power!

285
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,860
Soldier-san, you're a toy!

286
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,440
Stop whining!

287
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,490
Focus! Rebecca!

288
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,190
Bring out your human instincts!

289
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,350
Believe in your human power!

290
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,100
I don't wanna learn to fight anymore!

291
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,140
Protect me to the end!

292
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,130
Because you promised me!

293
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,990
You promised that
you'd protect me with your life!

294
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,560
You said,
until the day I'm filled with happiness,

295
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,450
you'll always be by my side!

296
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,230
I'm a toy.

297
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,670
Rain and wind will rust my body!

298
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,330
I don't know how long my body's gonna last!

299
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,440
Stand up, Rebecca!

300
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,240
Be strong!

301
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,640
My body is not made to fight!

302
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,270
Maybe, toys are meant
to be broken after all...

303
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,730
...before children become adults!

304
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
Damn you!

305
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm sorry, Rebecca!

306
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,060
Since your father is clumsy,

307
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,940
all he can do is
to teach you to become strong!

308
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,580
I didn't know he was this strong!

309
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,650
Why're you doing this?!
You're just a toy, what do you want?!

310
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,120
I want a peaceful country where...

311
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,400
...my child can live happily!

312
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,470
I will take Dressrosa back
for the King Riku Family!

313
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,650
--What?!
--King Riku?!

314
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,270
What the hell are you talking about?!

315
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,480
I will sacrifice myself for that!

316
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,440
Wh-What just happened?!

317
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,910
That was fast.

318
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,810
What was that?!
I couldn't see anything!

319
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,770
I heard about it but...

320
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,920
I-I can't believe this!
Everybody's collapsed!

321
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,210
The surviving top contenders
of Block D have gone down

322
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,500
one after another!

323
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,400
And no one's left standing!

324
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,290
Is this for real?!

325
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,510
It all happened in a blink of an eye,
in the Block D match!

326
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,230
Oh, wait!

327
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,030
Somebody is about to stand up!
