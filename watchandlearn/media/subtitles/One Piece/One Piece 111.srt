00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:15,050
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,570
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,370
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,180
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people take up weapons.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,160
Having escaped from the trap at
Raindinners, Luffy and the others

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,330
set out toward Alubarna to plead with
a rebel army that numbered two million,

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,800
but he was caught by a waiting
Crocodile, and they began a duel.

28
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,270
However, unable to do
anything in the face

29
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,080
of his overwhelming power,
Luffy fell before him.

30
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,230
Will this situation continue to
deteriorate into a worst-case scenario?

31
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,490
"Dash For a Miracle!
Alabasta Animal Land"

32
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,640
Look! T-There's so much!

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,550
L-Look...

34
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,160
The water...

35
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,700
The water is coming forth!

36
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,830
Didn't I say so, Luffy-kun?

37
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,160
This land is strong.

38
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,210
Yuba still lives.

39
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,470
Yuba is going to die from
that one, final sandstorm.

40
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,920
And then, the flame of anger in
the rebel army will burn even hotter.

41
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,970
This outdated consideration for others

42
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,380
is going to destroy this land.

43
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,980
And the same goes for you,
Straw Hat Luffy.

44
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,980
If you had abandoned
your worthless feelings,

45
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,990
you would have lived longer.

46
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,220
Water...?

47
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,730
I doubt you still feel
indebted to this water, huh?

48
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,400
You mean, you're still alive?

49
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,730
It looks like that hurts. But you'll
be out of your misery soon enough.

50
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,040
Bye, now.

51
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,320
That was a waste of my time.

52
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,680
No big deal. Once we get
through this sand, it will rain.

53
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,000
Just like always.

54
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,120
Keep coming! Keep coming as
often as you want, sandstorms!

55
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,270
Yuba will never give in to the sand!

56
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,750
Then, that's when it happened!
That's when I said to him,

57
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,270
"You bowlegged bastard!"

58
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,310
That's when it started. Ever since,

59
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,860
the crabs of the world have been
bothered about being bowlegged.

60
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,360
So that's why they walk sideways, huh?

61
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,980
Uh-huh. Incidentally, at the time,
there was something

62
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,730
jumping up and down
behind him. It was a lobster.

63
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,320
So lobsters-- they're crabs, then?

64
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,740
Yeah, they're crabs.

65
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,000
Zoro, you're just wasting your
energy doing that, aren't you?

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,330
Shut up.

67
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,810
Just leave him alone, Nami-san.

68
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,430
If those guys aren't doing something,
they can't keep focused.

69
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,700
They're not that adept. Especially...

70
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,280
...that muscle freak, now that
he's had a taste of the level

71
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,660
the Seven Warlords have.

72
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,070
Hey, you, what are you trying to say?

73
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,950
Go ahead and spell it out.

74
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,810
Ah, you want me to say it?

75
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,040
You're scared. You're worried
that maybe Luffy might lose.

76
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,700
Who, me?! Scared, you say?! Why, you...!

77
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,840
Fancy eyebrows!

78
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,600
That does it! Now I'm mad!

79
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,640
You... moss head!

80
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,470
What?!

81
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,860
You wanna go at it?!

82
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,980
Cut it out! This is pointless!

83
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,070
She's strong!

84
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,480
They are who they are.
Everyone's a bit worked up.

85
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,320
Now's the time for me,
the vice-captain, to...

86
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,370
Take it easy, everyone.

87
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,650
Luffy-san won't lose. I mean,
we promised him, didn't we?

88
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,310
That we'd be waiting for him in Alubarna?

89
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,960
You seem more worried
than any of us, don't you?!

90
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,150
Ow!

91
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,920
You should just worry about the rebellion.

92
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,630
Sorry about that, Vivi-chan.

93
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,600
If you have to cover for us, we're done for.

94
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,620
All right, then, switch your
minds over to "Alubarna"!

95
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,990
Let's go, Pincers!

96
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,060
What's that?

97
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,650
A name for the crab.

98
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,910
"Pincers," you say?

99
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,430
No good?

100
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,550
Nothing wrong with it.

101
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,360
Me, go to Alubarna?

102
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,840
We're chasing after the
Straw Hat pirates, right?

103
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
Or are we reinforcing the royal army?

104
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,770
It's up to you.

105
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,530
You decide what to do when you're there.

106
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,080
You don't mean that!
Exactly what is going on?

107
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,050
You just follow your sense of justice.

108
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,790
Whatever happens, I'll accept responsibility.

109
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,100
Captain Smoker, where are you going?

110
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,860
Something sudden came up.
I'm heading out to sea.

111
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,240
Be prepared to receive communication
from me at any time, Tashigi.

112
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,350
Yes, sir.

113
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,820
Keep a close watch on
where this country ends up.

114
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,500
Whether it falls, or whether it survives,

115
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,000
something is sure to happen
to mark the start of a new age.

116
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,580
Sergeant... Sergeant!

117
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,120
Your orders?

118
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,220
Right...

119
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,780
Keep a close watch on
where this country ends up.

120
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,640
Whether it falls, or whether it survives,

121
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,180
something is sure to happen
to mark the start of a new age.

122
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,880
We're going after the pirate
Straw Hat Luffy, and everyone under him!

123
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,440
All hands, reinforce your gear!
Prepare to depart for Alubarna!

124
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,910
Yes, sir!

125
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,350
Straw Hat Luffy...

126
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,770
What?! We can't cross
the river with this crab?!

127
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,330
Moving Crabs are creatures of the desert,
so they don't take to water.

128
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,170
But it's a crab, right? A crab!
Not a lobster! Do something!

129
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,260
Hey, this is a problem. Not good.

130
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,020
Look here.

131
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,350
If we just blithely swim across
this river, as wide as a sea,

132
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,680
we're not going to
make it in time! And look!

133
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,180
After we cross the river, there's
still dozens of kilos worth of desert!

134
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,470
If this crab can't get to the other shore,

135
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,360
are we supposed to run from there on?!

136
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,260
We don't have any choice.

137
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,070
There's no way we'll make it in time!

138
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,190
It's absolutely impossible!

139
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,000
Uh-oh. Hey, the river!

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,570
I can see Sandora River!

141
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,210
What?!

142
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,580
Do something, Pincers-kun!

143
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,670
I know! Pincers loves dancing girls!

144
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,540
Will this do?

145
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,380
Probably.

146
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,490
Holy crap!

147
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,670
Ah, he's looking this way!

148
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,990
We're accelerating!

149
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,830
Nami-san!

150
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,340
You've now messed up two
animals with all this nonsense!

151
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,780
All right, pervy power!

152
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,740
So, what has this solved? Chopper!

153
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,790
Go!

154
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,340
He did it!

155
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,450
Hey, now, this crab is incredible!
I don't believe it!

156
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,250
Whoa, way to go!

157
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,030
It's a miracle!
Just stay on the water, and run!

158
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,370
Run, run, run all the way! Go!

159
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,370
You can make it! Keep going!
You can do it! This crab can do it!

160
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,370
Hey, what's this?! Am I imagining
things, or are we sinking?

161
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,770
We are sinking, here!

162
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,940
Stop sinking, you crab!

163
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,930
No time to whine about it.
Keep moving forward.

164
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,920
H-Hold on a second!

165
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,660
Aren't there any boats?
How many kilos to the other shore?

166
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,990
About 50 kilos.

167
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,890
Who can swim that?!

168
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,960
Thank you!

169
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,330
Thank you, Pincers!

170
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,930
This is no time to be
casually waving goodbye!

171
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,720
What?!

172
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,220
It's a rare Sandoran catfish!
They're only very rarely seen!

173
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,200
You don't have to explain that!

174
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,700
Also, humans are their favorite food!

175
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,020
You might tell us that first!

176
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,480
Hey, let go! I can't see anything
in front of me, you know!

177
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,100
Chopper, let go!

178
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,640
Kung Fu Dugongs?!

179
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,000
They say they won't
neglect their senior pupil.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,340
Well, it's not like we're
Luffy's pupils, or anything...

181
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,140
Still, they saved us.

182
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,490
All right, just a little
farther! Hang in there!

183
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,880
Thank you!

184
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,980
Bye-bye!

185
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,790
Things have been going smoothly.
Can we make it?

186
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,350
That's a tough one.

187
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,020
Even riding on Lashes-kun,
I'm not sure there's enough time.

188
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,360
What's more, he could
only carry, uh... two of us!

189
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,290
And if Baroque Works is going to
attack us, it will be from here on.

190
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,030
Isn't there any way for
all of us to act together?

191
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,660
Damn, there isn't any, huh?

192
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,880
Look over there!

193
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,390
What, is it the enemy?
A-A-Are they here already?!

194
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,340
N-No! That's...!

195
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,690
Karoo!

196
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,880
And the Supersonic Duck Squadron!

197
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,510
You've come to get us, haven't you?!

198
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,980
Karoo!

199
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,930
Meat!

200
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,220
There's a difference in the level
of pirate that you and I are.

201
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,350
Yuba is going to die.

202
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,140
And then, the flame of anger in
the rebel army will burn even hotter.

203
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,330
Thank... you...

204
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,380
Why do you fight?

205
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,310
You, who have the name of "D"?

206
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,320
"D"...?

207
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,360
Who are you people?

208
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,620
Apparently, that was
a pointless question, huh?

209
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,000
I found you!

210
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,130
Where is Vivi-sama?!

211
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,590
My.

212
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,330
Are you awake already?

213
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,830
Now that I've got a handle on your ability,

214
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,760
this won't turn out like last time!

215
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,440
Don't overexert yourself.
You must be seriously hurt.

216
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,430
This works out perfectly.
Why don't you save that boy?

217
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,640
He is a courageous knight

218
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,940
who delivered your precious
princess to this land, after all.

219
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,230
Besides, the princess is safe.

220
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,980
She's on her way to Alubarna right now.

221
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm not sure about what will
happen to her later, though.

222
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,340
The situation is what it is, you know?

223
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,580
If I'm no match for her, then just
who will be able to protect Vivi-sama?

224
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,140
Meat!

225
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,300
Just you wait, Cobra.
We're going to defend Alabasta.

226
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,950
We're not about to turn it over to you!

227
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,270
"Royal Army"
"Rebel Army"

228
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,240
"The capital, Alubarna"

229
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,240
Hurry! Look lively!

230
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,190
Stack it up higher!

231
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,990
Ready cannons at the southern gate!
Stop dawdling around! Hurry!

232
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,810
Bring more cannonballs over here!

233
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,110
Chaka-sama!

234
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,360
The enemy's number is said
to be well over two million!

235
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,470
What do you think of
His Highness's attack on Nanohana?

236
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,690
I have served him for
ten years, so I was quite...

237
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah. There's really no way
anyone could believe it.

238
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,280
I can only presume that something
must have happened to the King.

239
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,680
And if so, it's all the more reason
why we must not lose this fight.

240
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,800
Do not flinch at the enemy's number.

241
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,950
For the King's sake, as well as for that
of Vivi-sama, who has returned home,

242
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,910
we are going to defend this country!

243
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,500
Everyone who is not
involved in this battle,

244
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,750
take shelter outside the city!
We cannot warrant your lives if you stay!

245
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,700
Run! We're going to be
caught up in the battle!

246
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,270
Things are finally starting
to become hectic, huh?

247
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,980
Hurry up and start fighting,
already, will you?

248
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,930
Things are so slow, I can't stand it.

249
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,660
I don't care if he is the king,
or if he is the king,

250
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,000
I can't take guarding him for too long.

251
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,920
Can't take it!
Can't, can't, for crying out loud!

252
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,670
I mean, sure, slipping
past the palace guards

253
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,150
and kidnapping this guy is a mission
that only we could carry out,

254
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,010
but now that it's over,
nothing could be more boring than this!

255
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,690
Right, Mr. 4?

256
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,680
You heard me, right?

257
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,390
You are so slow when it comes
to answering me, really!

258
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,430
Ah, my back is sore!
My back hurts! My back!

259
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,660
Chaka... Koza...

260
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,690
You must not fight. You yourselves
are what this country is.

261
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,560
You must not overcome each other.

262
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,730
Those who lament war...

263
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,020
Those who go to war...

264
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,750
Go on, run away!

265
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,850
Those who incite war...

266
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,220
Those who know the truth,
and would prevent it...

267
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,090
Each of their feelings are at odds,

268
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,450
as they clash in the
capital city of Alubarna.

269
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,920
"Port town of Nanohana"

270
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,100
The final revolt has begun, has it?

271
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,030
There was a ship.
Vivi-sama and the others

272
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,440
appear to have arrived in this land safely.

273
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,450
I must hurry. I do hope I am in time.

274
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,850
I always wanted to talk about it

275
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,790
I couldn't even say half of it

276
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

277
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:55,650
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

278
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,020
Glory glory you're my shine

279
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,560
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

280
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,100
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

281
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,970
I'm sure I'll make it there

282
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,980
I see it! There's Alubarna!

283
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,860
Let's go! Everyone ready?!

284
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,990
The rebel army is all yours, Vivi.

285
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,660
If I don't stop them now, then all
that we've done will be for naught!

286
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,600
Please, listen to what
I have to say, everyone!

287
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,390
I thought I just heard a voice...
Am I imagining things?

288
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,000
"Rebel Army vs. Royal Army!
Showdown at Alubarna!"

290
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,390
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
