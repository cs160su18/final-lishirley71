2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,010
"Steer for the Clouds! Capture the South Bird!"

20
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,310
What do you need to tell us, old guy?

21
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,200
Here. I'll start by telling you
everything I know about the sky island.

22
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,910
None of it's certain, but it's up to you
if you wanna believe it or not!

23
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,440
Yeah! We believe you!

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,350
Geez, you're fast!

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,790
There's a strange phenomenon
that occurs in these waters--

26
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,380
sometimes it'll turn to night,
even though it's the middle of the day.

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,910
Yeah! We saw that! Right?!

28
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,580
Yeah! Night came, and then
some monsters appeared!

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,780
The giants?

30
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,130
There's a story about where they
come from, but forget 'em for now.

31
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,600
This sudden nightfall...

32
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,140
It's caused by the shadows
of extremely compact clouds...

33
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,480
You mean cumulonimbus clouds?
But it was too dark to be clouds...

34
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,200
Wow! You're so dumb, old guy!

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
It gets cloudy on days
when there's lots of clouds!

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,830
Yeah! Cloudy!

37
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,450
Cloudy!

38
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,420
Shut up and listen!

39
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,220
There are clouds known as
"cumuloregalis clouds."

40
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,750
They pile high into the sky but
produce no air currents or rain.

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,220
When they appear high in the sky,
even sunlight is blocked out,

42
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,380
bringing afternoon "nighttime" to the ground.

43
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,460
One theory has it that cumuloregalis
clouds are fossilized clouds

44
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,870
that have floated in the sky for
thousands and thousands of years.

45
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,320
That's ridiculous! Clouds with no
air currents even after building up?!

46
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,300
You're free to believe they can't exist.

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,770
I'm not asking you to believe me!

48
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,000
They're mystery clouds, then?

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,480
Pretty much. There's still
no explanation for them.

50
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,910
You're awesome, Luffy!

51
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,860
Listen. If a sky island really does exist...

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,880
...that'd be the only possible place!

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,030
Okay! Gotcha! Let's go above those clouds!

54
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,180
Get up, Zoro!

55
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,220
Huh? Is it morning?

56
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,250
Get ready, everyone! Cloud rudder full!

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,210
Thanks for filling us in, old guy!

58
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,760
How many times do I gotta say
we don't know how to get there?!

59
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,270
Now comes the real problem.

60
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,240
Let me start by saying this...
Put your lives on the line!

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,770
We're already near death...

62
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,430
The Knock-Up Stream is a
current that shoots into the air...

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,060
You can theoretically take it
into the sky. Understand?

64
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,020
It's a current that can send ships flying, right?

65
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,030
Oh! Then it just needs to
send us above the clouds!

66
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,050
Yahoo!

67
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,990
On a current?

68
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,430
But wouldn't we just end up
smashing back into the ocean?

69
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,000
Normally, yeah. The key is timing.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's easy to talk about
being sent up the current,

71
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,560
but it's not gonna be as nice
a trip as you guys think.

72
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,090
The Knock-Up Stream is a natural disaster.

73
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,110
It's something that should
normally be avoided!

74
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,190
How exactly does a water
current rise into the sky?

75
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,070
We've never heard of
anything like that before...

76
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,630
Yeah!

77
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,840
Naturally, we can only guess as to
how that monstrous current works.

78
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,140
No one's dumb enough to
jump in and find out, after all.

79
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,120
The accepted theory goes like this!

80
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,870
Deep beneath the sea floor,
there are large cavities,

81
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,930
and low-temperature
sea water seeps into them.

82
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,930
The heat from the earth below
turns that water into steam,

83
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,770
and the resulting pressure causes
an explosion on the sea floor.

84
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,280
One big enough to send the sea flying
and create a current into the sky!

85
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,540
For about one minute, the sea
continues to rise into the sky.

86
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,260
One minute?! What size of explosion
are we talking about here?!

87
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,780
The explosions change location each time,

88
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,210
and occur five times a month.

89
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,760
You want us to be blown into smithereens...?!

90
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,710
But, y'know,

91
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,100
describing a grand natural phenomenon
with words and logic is foolish.

92
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,370
S-So, basically, we gotta ride this current
that only appears five times a month

93
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,120
and hope the sky island shows up?

94
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:43,270
Yeah. And if you miss, you'll fall
back down, slam into the ocean...

95
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,920
...and then you'll all end up
at the bottom of the sea.

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,270
A-Alright! Let's give up on the sky island!

97
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,630
It's impossible!

98
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,950
You gotta have the luckiest luck
that's ever lucked to make it there!

99
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,440
We'll be fine! Let's go!

100
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,000
How did I know?

101
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,640
"We'll be fine"? How can you say
such groundless stuff so easily...?!

102
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,510
I mean, just look at the Going Merry now!

103
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,080
It looks so pitiful!

104
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,950
It can't stand up to a
gigantic disaster like that!

105
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,270
That's true. Even in mint condition,
that ship wouldn't stand a chance.

106
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,660
What?!

107
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,960
Speed, weight, strength...

108
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,410
That boat'd be blasted apart in the explosion.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,170
But... See! It really is impossible!

110
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,840
But don't you worry about that.

111
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,290
I'll have Masira and Shojo
help take you there.

112
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,130
Only after we strengthen your ship, of course.

113
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,870
Yeah! Just leave it to us!

114
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,180
Thanks, guys!

115
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,330
Didn't even ask us...

116
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,910
Do you even understand?!

117
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,520
Understand what?

118
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,590
For starters... Yeah!

119
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,270
The most we can stay on
this island is one more day!

120
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,710
After that, the Log Pose will
start pointing to the next island!

121
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah! Yeah! We won't make it in time!

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Seriously, old man! You're not a psychic!

123
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,870
I doubt you know,
but how many days will it be

124
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,620
until the Knock-Up Stream and
the cumuloregalis clouds line up?!

125
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,850
No, no! How many months?!
No, how many years?!

126
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,090
Tomorrow afternoon.
If you're going, you better get ready!

127
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,210
We can't make it in that time!

128
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,050
Oh? If you don't like it, then just quit!

129
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,440
Y-You're lying!

130
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,230
This isn't right! We just met you today!
Aren't you being too nice?!

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,990
Plus...!

132
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,470
Hold on, Usopp!

133
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,580
Shut up, you!

134
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,010
Tomorrow just happens
to be the perfect chance

135
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,210
to go to this legendary,
unknown "sky island"?!

136
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,850
And you'll help strengthen
our ship and take us there?!

137
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,360
That's way too convenient!

138
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,260
What exactly are you scheming?!

139
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,790
Plus you're Noland the Liar's
descendant! We can't trust you!

140
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,430
Old-timer! Dinner's ready!

141
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,250
Move!

142
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,690
Nami-san! Dinner's--

143
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,120
W-What?! Are you gonna fight?!

144
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,080
Whenever "midday night"
is confirmed in Masira's turf,

145
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,670
cumuloregalis clouds appear in
the southern skies the next day.

146
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,020
And judging from its five-per-month rate,

147
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,850
the Knock-Up Stream will
probably be active tomorrow.

148
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,570
It'll happen somewhere south of here.

149
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,590
It's not a 100% certainty, but there's
a good chance it'll be tomorrow!

150
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,050
I'm glad to have met fools like you.

151
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,240
Now, let's go and have some food!
Take it easy at my place today...

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
...comrades!

153
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,490
Food! Hurry, Usopp!

154
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,720
Yeah! C'mon!

155
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,480
Chopper! Go get Robin-chan!

156
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,470
Right!

157
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,590
Looks like all we can do is try
our best to get into the sky...

158
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,030
Though in the end, it's up to luck...

159
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,460
Nami. Am I miserable and cowardly?

160
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,420
You forgot "stupid."

161
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,270
I know how you feel. Now go apologize.

162
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,380
I'm sorry, old guy!

163
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,130
What the...?! Yuck! Don't wipe your snot on me!

164
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,430
Today's booze is especially great!

165
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,970
Eat up, eat up! The saury full
course is just getting started!

166
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,440
Here!

167
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,190
Gotcha, salvage bum!
That's a Tabasco Bomber!

168
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,350
Why, you! Long-nose!

169
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,880
Girlie! Come sit here!

170
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,380
It's 100 years too early to
have Nami-san wait on you!

171
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,180
"I saw gold...

172
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,140
...in the skull's right eye!"

173
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,600
Gold?!

174
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,000
That tear-soaked sentence was
the last thing Noland wrote.

175
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,930
"I saw gold in the skull's right eye..."

176
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,400
Noland was executed that same day.

177
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,820
Even after coming to Jaya,
those words make no sense at all.

178
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,670
"The skull's right eye..."

179
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,950
Is it referring to the name
of a city that once existed?

180
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,410
Or was it an allusion to his own death?

181
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,010
The blank pages that follow say nothing...

182
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,870
So that's why we dive!

183
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,220
We have a dream! On the sea floor!

184
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,010
That's right!

185
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,330
We're gonna fly!

186
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,980
Not if you keep eating like that, we won't!

187
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,640
It's gotten quite late, but I see it, Bellamy.

188
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,250
Prepare to go ashore.

189
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,520
Dream-chasing fools deserve
more than a few lumps!

190
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,640
"The day I arrived on Jaya.
Entry for May 21, 1122."

191
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,860
Noland! Noland!

192
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,700
"Upon landing on the island,
we heard strange bird calls

193
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,420
and the sound of a very large
bell coming from the forest.

194
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,050
The sound from that huge
gold bell resonated far and wide,

195
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,540
almost as if showing off the
prosperity of a city long past!

196
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,510
We thought we knew everything
after living for a few decades..."

197
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,060
Noland! Noland!

198
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,500
"...but experiencing the transience
of this civilization that flourished

199
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,510
for a long time on the wide
open sea left us speechless!

200
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,510
The sound of the bell had
us stopped in our tracks!"

201
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,380
Noland's so cool!

202
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,380
Wow! A giant gold bell!

203
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,350
Wait a minute, old guy!
You like Noland after all!

204
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,140
Look at this!

205
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,290
Wow! Gold bells!

206
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,200
So, how exactly are those "giant"?

207
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,850
These aren't that bell.
They're bell-shaped ingots.

208
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,690
We found these three on the sea floor.

209
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,670
Ingots?

210
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,110
Oh! So there really is a city of gold!

211
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,780
They don't prove that.

212
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,650
You could find that much gold in any old ruins.

213
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,600
But it does prove that there
was a civilization in this area.

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,580
Ingots are made to have standardized weights.

215
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,440
Which means they were used for trade.

216
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,460
Yes. And the strange bird calls
mentioned before that...

217
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,580
Hey, Masira!

218
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,330
Whoa! There's more?!

219
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,370
This one's huge!

220
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,700
That's all of 'em.

221
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,750
Wow! It's so pretty!

222
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,060
Gold bells and a bird...

223
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,080
Do you suppose they were symbols of old Jaya?

224
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,090
Dunno, but I think they were
part of some sort of model.

225
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,100
This here's called a South Bird,
and they still exist on this island!

226
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,400
Oh! Do they have weird calls?

227
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,230
Yep. Just like the logbook says!

228
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,650
Sailors have long used South Birds to...

229
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,060
Oh, crap!

230
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,620
What is it?! What's wrong?!

231
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,150
This is bad! You guys! Go into
the forest! The southern forest!

232
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,190
Huh?! What're you talking about?!
Are you crazy, old guy?!

233
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,010
Go catch this bird! Right now!

234
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,510
Why?! What for?!

235
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,840
Why do we need a bird?

236
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,940
Listen closely! The Knock-Up Stream
you're heading for tomorrow

237
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,020
is located directly south of this cape.

238
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,810
How are you going to get there?!

239
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,440
Just sail straight there, right?

240
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,530
This is the Grand Line, you know!

241
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,990
Once you're on the open sea,
there's no way to get your bearings!

242
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,620
That's right!

243
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,250
We're heading for ocean, not an island,
so we have no guide to rely on!

244
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,270
Then how do we go straight south?

245
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,580
You use that bird's behavior!

246
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,380
Some types of animals have
accurate, internal magnets

247
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,750
which allow them to get their bearings.

248
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,210
Then you're lower than an animal, Zoro!

249
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,720
Like you're anyone to talk!

250
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,910
South Birds are the greatest of such animals!

251
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,270
No matter how vast the land
or sea they're thrown into,

252
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,190
their bodies will always indicate
the direction accurately.

253
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,070
Anyway, without one of these birds,
you're going nowhere!

254
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,620
You won't even get the
chance to go to the sky island!

255
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,950
Eh?!

256
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,160
Why are you telling us this now?!

257
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,160
Quit fussing!

258
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,170
There's no time! Hurry! Don't dilly-dally!

259
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,950
You want us to go into the forest
in the middle of the night?!

260
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,210
You forgot these!

261
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,620
We're gonna get started on your beat-up ship!

262
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,120
Now that I think about it,
there was no time to be partyin'!

263
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,100
Again, why are you telling us this now?!

264
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,730
Listen! Make sure you catch at
least one South Bird before dawn!

265
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,150
It's pitch dark!

266
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,250
Quit pulling me!

267
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,640
It's not my fault! My hands
are moving on their own!

268
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,650
My stomach's so full...
I don't think I can chase birds...

269
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,650
Where are these weird birds?!

270
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,980
Let's just catch one so we
can get back to drinking!

271
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,450
How did we wind up doing this so suddenly?!

272
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,830
--You're in the way!
--Man! Couldn't he have told us during the day?!

273
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,800
Hey, where are the birds?

274
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,250
If we knew where they were,
we wouldn't be out looking for 'em!

275
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,980
Our only clue is that they have a weird call...

276
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,980
And they look just like that gold statue...

277
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,580
Are there really such dumb-looking birds?!

278
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,480
Plus "weird call" is way too vague!
How're we supposed to know?!

279
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,940
He said we'd know once we're in the forest...

280
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,240
A weird call!

281
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,220
That's it!

282
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,310
Alright!

283
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,870
At this point, we got no other choice!

284
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,520
We have three nets. Let's split
into three groups and search!

285
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,480
Right!

286
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,880
Let's go! Let's beat up those weird birds!

287
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,760
You mean catch!

288
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,630
Don't worry! Whatever we run into,
I'll protect you, Nami-san!

289
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,020
Sanji-kun! What about me?!

290
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,650
Hell if I care! Quit being insecure!

291
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,180
In any case, let's catch a bird
so we can get out of this forest!

292
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,200
Let's start by listening closely
for that bird we heard earlier.

293
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,110
That bird call!

294
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,900
Jooo! Come out! Joooo!

295
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,370
Bastard!

296
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,500
What're you catching me for?!

297
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,960
Oh, Nami! That's a cool thing
you got on! Where'd you get it?

298
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,330
What?

299
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,170
Spider!

300
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,420
Huh? It's just a spider!
You poor thing... Come here!

301
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,500
Spiders are yucky, you moron!
Toss it away somewhere!

302
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,490
Get away, Usopp! I bet it's poisonous!

303
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,060
They're falling from the trees!

304
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,880
This is too gross!

305
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,690
It's probably a species of tarantula!

306
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,590
It's alright! They won't spit poison
as long as we don't do anything!

307
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,700
I used to fight spiders a long time ago!

308
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,600
No, you can count me out when
it comes to creepy bugs like that!

309
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,750
Same here! I totally hate them!
Totally! Hurry and throw it far away!

310
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,990
Oh? But those moths and
centipedes don't bother you?

311
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,630
I hate moths and centipedes!

312
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,990
Ahh! Don't leave me behind!

313
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,840
I hear screams...

314
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,730
Forget about 'em.

315
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,230
A centipede, huh? It's pretty damn big...

316
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,860
It's not nice to kill everything. Poor thing...

317
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,480
That's what it gets for trying to attack me.

318
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,650
But...

319
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,860
What?!

320
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,910
That's the path we just took here.

321
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,190
That bird call... This way.

322
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,500
Watch out for that quagmire.

323
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,130
Hey! Wait for--!

324
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,880
Gotcha!

325
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,350
Look, Chopper! It's an Atlas!

326
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,350
Atlas?

327
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,350
Yup! Atlases and Hercules are
the most admired bugs in the world!

328
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,820
Really? Beetles?

329
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,710
You never heard of 'em?!
They're super hard to catch!

330
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,030
Which is better, them or the One Piece?!

331
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,200
Hmm... That's hard!

332
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,790
Luffy! There's something here, too!

333
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,910
Oh! It's a Miyama!

334
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,740
Catch it!

335
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
It flew away!

336
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,320
Why, you...!

337
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,760
After it! Don't let it get away!

338
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,330
A beehive! Run!

339
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,320
What's with this forest?!

340
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,980
Luffy! Look there!

341
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,970
It's that bird!

342
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,970
He dropped the beehives!

343
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,490
Eh?!

344
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,310
Huh? Did he say something?!

345
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,280
He said, "I'll kill you for invading this forest!"

346
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,060
Now, now, boy! Don't be making us mad!

347
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,200
It's not nice to suddenly show up
at night and demand gold, kiddos.

348
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,350
Leave! We got work to do now!

349
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,110
You're bodyguards, huh?

350
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,310
Come to think of it, there was
a pirate named Cricket...

351
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,370
I heard the sad tale of your
Montblanc family at the pub.

352
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,770
It moved me so.

353
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,690
Treasure someone else struggled to
get has a special flavor all its own!

354
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,630
Wanna know what people call me?

355
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,200
The Hyena!

356
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:17,600
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

357
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:27,660
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

358
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,590
There are days where I almost lose to myself

359
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:52,010
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

360
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:58,140
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

361
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:08,490
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

362
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:17,330
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

363
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,460
This unique moment...

364
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,700
Old guy! We caught a bird!

365
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,450
W-What happened, old diamond-head?!

366
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,140
S-Sorry!

367
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,240
There's nothing we could do! We're pathetic!

368
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,970
The gold's been stolen!

369
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,420
It's alright! Forget about that junk!

370
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,870
Bellamy's mark!

371
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,960
I'll be back by morning!

372
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,910
On the next episode of One Piece!

373
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,170
"Dreams Don't Come True?!
Bellamy versus the Saruyama Alliance"

374
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
