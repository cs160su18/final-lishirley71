2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,320
Isn't it a quiet night?

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,030
I'm on watch, but it's
been calm all night long.

49
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,480
There is no need to man the helm.

50
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm working myself to the bone for nothing.

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,970
Never mind that I'm all bones!

52
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,990
I'm so bored.

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,920
Laboon...

54
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,040
You know Luffy-san and his buddies?
I've joined their crew.

55
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,060
They are great people.

56
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,370
But they are more than just that.

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,630
I found something incredible
earlier this afternoon!

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,560
It told of Luffy-san and his crew's fearsome
adventures and their battle-filled days.

59
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,480
Now that I have joined them,

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,250
I must prove that I am worthy
to call myself a crewmate!

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,550
Wouldn't you agree, Laboon?

62
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,990
Good morning, everyone!

63
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,060
I'll wake you up with a song.

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,230
--♪ White handkerchief, ♪
--Shut up!

65
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,960
--♪ don't let him find you ♪
--The sun hasn't risen yet!

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
--♪ Run for it ♪
--Let me catch some more Z's!

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,100
--♪ White handkerchief... ♪
--Forget Brook. Someone make
Luffy stop snoring!

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,330
"Brook's Great Struggle! Is the Path
to Becoming a True Comrade Rigorous?"

69
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,950
What's the plan, Navigator?

70
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,990
If we use the paddle, we could keep
moving through these calm waters.

71
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,910
Based on the weather,
this lull should only last today.

72
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,960
Then we don't need to use our precious cola.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,130
This is good!
Sanji, your cooking really is the best!

74
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,110
Robin-chan, have a second
helping of the seafood salad.

75
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,160
Thank you.

76
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,540
What's gotten into you, Brook?

77
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,520
Why have you been so hyper all morning?

78
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,940
Did something exciting happen, Brook?

79
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,090
He said that he saw our ship's log
while he was on watch yesterday.

80
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,200
Right! I just so happened
to read a small portion of it.

81
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,130
To be honest, it left me astonished!

82
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,240
I haven't been able to
settle down ever since.

83
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,330
The incident at Thriller Bark was
only the tip of the iceberg for you!

84
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,740
You stopped a civil war in
the desert kingdom, Alabasta.

85
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,470
You had a grand adventure
on the legendary sky island!

86
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,190
Furthermore, you took on
the World Government in a

87
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,760
massive fight at Water Seven!

88
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,390
I was so surprised, I
nearly had a heart attack!

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
Oh, but I don't have a heart.

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,310
Yeah. I wonder what sort of stories
will get added to the log.

91
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,730
Brook, your name is going to
start appearing in it now, too.

92
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,770
About that! Now that I am your crewmate,

93
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,280
it is imperative that I make myself useful!

94
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,330
I get why you're eager to work hard,

95
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,290
but first let me give you a word of advice.

96
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,750
I'd love to hear it, Nami-san!

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,880
With this crew, never let your
guard down during a meal.

98
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,580
Got it! I, Quick Draw Brook, shall be

99
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,370
ready for the enemy to strike at any time!

100
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,970
Apparently we didn't warn you soon enough.

101
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,760
I claim those noodles!

102
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,520
P-Please wait a second! Luffy-san!

103
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,270
They're good!

104
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,520
I should not have let my guard down,
even for a moment.

105
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,860
Very well! I shall work
myself to the bone to become

106
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,490
a true pal as soon as possible!

107
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,840
But I'm already nothing but bones...

108
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,700
Sanji-san!

109
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,890
I appreciate it. Since
you're washing the dishes,

110
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,420
I can take my time with Nami-san's tea.

111
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,230
As your pal, I am dying to help
everyone in extravagant ways,

112
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,220
but I'll do anything to make
myself useful for the time being.

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,060
That's a great attitude.

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,440
Since I'm a skeleton, I should work
till I'm bone tired on the small stuff.

115
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,750
Well, I'm going to give Nami-san her tea.

116
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,610
Ah! Sanji-san, where do these go?

117
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,070
Oh, over in the...

118
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,870
Don't drop them, even if it kills you!

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,540
But I'm already dead!

120
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,410
--And "kaboom!"
--Don't say that!

121
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,160
Hold this!

122
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,600
Splendid!

123
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,340
Don't give me that!

124
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,230
I can't trust you to do the dishes!

125
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,540
Oh, then I'll take this
tea to Nami-san instead.

126
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,520
Wait! Wait! I was gonna take it to her!

127
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,120
Nami-san, I've brought you some tea.

128
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,860
Come in!

129
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,960
May I see your panties?

130
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,820
--Bam!
--That came out of nowhere!

131
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,260
Is that a nautical chart?

132
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,400
We've been pretty busy lately.

133
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,170
This is a great chance to work on it,
since the ship isn't going anywhere.

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,460
Isn't it your dream to
draw a map of the world?

135
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,010
Right. I want to navigate
across the oceans of the world

136
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,140
and make a world map based on what I've seen.

137
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,800
That's wonderful!

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,560
If there is anything
I could do to help, please let me know.

139
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,760
Oh, would you like another cup?

140
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,160
Thank you.

141
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,380
That sentiment is enough for now.

142
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,170
You are both beautiful and humble!
Nami-san, you truly are wonderful!

143
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,270
Really! I'm not that great.

144
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,660
No, you truly are--ouch! Hot! Hot!

145
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,470
Whoa, are you okay?

146
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,800
My, I nearly burned my fingers.

147
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,480
Not that I have any skin to burn!

148
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,050
My map!

149
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,220
What have I done?!
That was horribly careless of me.

150
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,260
Don't you worry!

151
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,300
Look! I wiped it clean.

152
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,180
Yeah, you wiped it clean of everything...

153
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
That's not what I wanted!

154
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,160
I'll be taking my leave!

155
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,900
I get the feeling that I won't be
the least bit useful if this keeps up...

156
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,100
Hey, Brook!

157
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,200
Luffy-san?

158
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,850
These two are about to do something neat.

159
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,200
You should watch.

160
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,500
Uh, okay...

161
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,390
Chopper-san, what are you doing up here?

162
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,180
I'm drying these herbs in the sun,
since the weather is so nice.

163
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,170
You see, Franky is gonna test his new weapon.

164
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,800
All right! This is the long-distance
"Super Franky Cannon."

165
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,570
It runs on cola energy.

166
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,140
Its range is several times

167
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,560
that of a conventional cannon.
Plus it's super accurate!

168
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,110
Combined with my sniper skills,
we'll be totally unstoppable!

169
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,180
This is exciting!

170
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,780
I have butterflies in my stomach!

171
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,560
I know, right?

172
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,410
Excuse me! Let me know if there
is anything I could do to help.

173
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,260
All right. In that case, please get
another barrel of cola to play it safe.

174
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,750
Not a problem. It would be my pleasure!

175
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,960
This must be it.

176
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,630
Here's the barrel of cola!

177
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,510
Great! Now if you could pour it in.

178
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,430
Certainly!

179
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,740
Target: That rock.

180
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,430
Got it! Locking on to the rock at 2 o'clock.

181
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,850
--Fire!
--Firing!

182
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,590
--Huh?
--That's strange.

183
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,360
Usopp, increase the pressure.

184
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,350
Okay, you've got it.

185
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,660
Man, this doesn't look good.

186
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,260
Crap!

187
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,950
This was a huge flop!

188
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,540
It should have worked.

189
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,140
This is kinda salty.

190
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,640
Something is mixed with the cola.

191
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,150
This is soy sauce.

192
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,930
What's the matter, everyone?

193
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,430
Show a little remorse!

194
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,470
You mistook a soy sauce barrel
for a cola barrel, didn't you?!

195
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,300
Oh, you're right! This
was a soy sauce barrel.

196
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,740
I cannon believe I made that mistake!

197
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,080
Shut up, you jerk!

198
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,980
--I'm terribly sorry!
--Why did you grab a soy sauce barrel?!

199
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
--I'm sorry!
--This is no time for puns!

200
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,920
Brook, you're hilarious!

201
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,340
--Don't give me any "I'm only bones" crap!
--Now I'm all sticky!

202
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,800
Aw, I have to wash all of
the herbs I had set out to dry.

203
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,300
This meat tastes great
with the soy sauce and cola!

204
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,260
Can you find a bright side to anything?

205
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,900
Everything I try ends up going horribly awry.

206
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,190
Excuse me, Zoro-san...

207
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,000
This is no time to watch in admiration!
I'm a fellow swordsman.

208
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,730
Isn't this meditation?

209
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,030
You enter a state of nothingness
while making your mind and body one.

210
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,050
I shall join you.

211
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,030
Excuse me, Zoro-san...

212
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,200
I am fully aware that it is improper to
talk during meditation sessions, but...

213
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,440
I don't mind.

214
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,750
--Well, you see...
--What is it?!

215
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,280
I need to use the restroom.

216
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,980
I didn't need to know that! Head on over--

217
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,520
--The thing is...
--What?

218
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,750
...my legs went numb, so I can't stand!

219
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,790
Do you have any muscles to go numb?!

220
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,540
Zoro-san, I'm on the verge
of having an accident.

221
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,490
For real? W-Wait, hold it!

222
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,950
--I'm gonna leak! It's coming!
--I'll take you! W-Wait! Hey, hold it in!

223
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,510
Despite what I want, I've
been nothing but a nuisance.

224
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,550
This is awful!

225
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,100
Robin-san!

226
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,740
Excuse me...

227
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,580
Is there anything I could
do to be of assistance?

228
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,850
Not in particular.

229
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,980
Is that right?

230
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,850
Brook, why are you so anxious?

231
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,110
Anxious?

232
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,930
I get the feeling you're afraid
of something.

233
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,080
Am I mistaken?

234
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,200
You are absolutely right, Robin-san.

235
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,890
That's right. I am terribly
anxious and scared.

236
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,670
When Luffy-san first asked me
to join his crew, I was thrilled!

237
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,800
Those simple words filled me with joy.

238
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,590
And then my heart danced

239
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,530
with excitement when I defeated
Oars alongside everyone.

240
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,060
May I join your crew?

241
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,230
Yeah, sure.

242
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,400
What?!

243
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,710
But does he truly want me in his crew?

244
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,370
If we continue to head toward the New World,

245
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,800
I have no doubt that powerful foes and
trials beyond our imagination await us.

246
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,210
I'm afraid that I will be
both useless and a hindrance.

247
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,750
And if that proves true, I

248
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,040
might get kicked off the ship!

249
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,560
That's right... I'm afraid
of losing my friends again

250
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,320
and returning to that
painfully long life of solitude.

251
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,350
I was...

252
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,250
...also anxious for the longest of times.

253
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,200
I was...

254
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,630
...also anxious for the longest of times.

255
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,170
I was constantly afraid that I
was unworthy to be their friend.

256
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,940
That is why I believed I could
become worthy of them

257
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,350
by throwing away my life for their sake.

258
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,960
Robin-san...

259
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,910
No matter how far I go on the sea,

260
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,610
I have a huge enemy that I can't shake off...

261
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,070
...because the world and
its darkness are my enemy!

262
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,370
That's why I didn't want
you to come to rescue me!

263
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,720
If I'm going to die someday anyway,

264
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,500
I want to die right here, right now!

265
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,250
I didn't realize that was how you felt...

266
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,000
But I was mistaken.

267
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,960
That isn't what it means to be a true friend.

268
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,190
Robin-san...

269
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,540
I'm sure you'll be fine.

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,390
Oomph!

271
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,350
Brook, we've got food! It's lunchtime.

272
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,350
Luffy-san...

273
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,120
Sanji worked extra hard to make
a full-course seafood lunch!

274
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,440
I just know it'll be good!

275
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,040
Luffy-san!

276
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,110
What's keeping you? Get a move on!

277
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,700
Are you absolutely certain I'm welcome?

278
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,160
That I may join the Straw Hat Crew?

279
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,120
Yup.

280
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,080
Jeez, give it some thought!

281
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,290
I decided to let you join,
so I'm glad to have you.

282
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,310
Now forget about that. Let's eat! Food!

283
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,710
Everyone's waiting!

284
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,220
Even the Straw Hats have
calm days like this...

285
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,310
Usopp, let's catch dinner!

286
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,480
Yeah!

287
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,440
How many years--no, decades--has it been

288
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,690
since I enjoyed such a carefree nap?

289
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,700
Hey, Brook! Are you gonna sleep forever?

290
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,760
Wake up! We spotted an island!

291
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,960
It's a summer island! It has a beach!

292
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,290
Huh? What?

293
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,860
When I was wandering the ocean alone,

294
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,090
I would dream about my old
friends and Laboon in my sleep.

295
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,550
I would jump awake with happiness,

296
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,380
only to face the painful reality
filled with despair and solitude.

297
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,110
Sleep was by no means a peaceful escape.

298
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,430
But if I listen carefully now...

299
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,670
So, Robin, what do you
think of these outfits?

300
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,510
Well, I think you'd look
good in this and this.

301
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,280
I knew it!

302
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,490
Perfect.

303
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,580
My pals are near me.

304
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,490
Even dead and skeletonized...

305
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,910
...I'm truly glad to be alive!

306
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,920
This is a short break time

307
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,830
before the next adventure
eventually falls upon us.

308
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,680
Yes, let your weary bones rest.

309
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,950
Laboon,

310
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,340
it looks like I will have

311
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,830
a slew of stories to
share when we meet again.

312
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,510
I hope you're looking forward to them!

313
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,100
The wind has picked up.

314
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,310
Everyone!

315
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,290
Guys!

316
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,570
Oomph!

317
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,000
It's about time we set out.

318
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,830
Yeah!

319
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,790
I promise to work my butt off!

320
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,830
But I'm a skeleton, so I don't have a butt.

321
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,420
We've reached the Red Line at last!

322
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,780
We'll finally get to see Fishman Island.

323
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,430
Where are the mermaids?

324
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,020
I don't see any mermaids,
but there is a sea monster.

325
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,980
The jerk!

326
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,310
Something popped out
when I whacked its stomach.

327
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,730
Could that be a--?!

328
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,260
On the next episode of One Piece!

329
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,230
"Halfway Across the Grand Line!
Arrival at the Red Line!"

330
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
