2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,020
That's Hogback's laugh.

48
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
What is this room?

49
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,980
His laboratory!

50
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,280
It's almost done!

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,030
What a glorious mario!

52
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,960
Behold, Cindry-chan!
The work of a genius... is truly art!

53
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,300
He's clearly trying to
turn that into a zombie.

54
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,010
Hogback revived all of
the zombies on the island.

55
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,050
That's the only possible explanation!

56
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,520
"Evil Be Gone"

57
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,830
Good day to you!

58
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,480
If you're curious about
what's inside, you should go in.

59
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,990
"Yo ho ho"?!

60
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,070
B-Brook...?!

61
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,410
A severely injured old man?

62
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,370
He's obviously a zombie!

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,290
How dare you make fun of zombies?!

64
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,150
Don't underestimate us!

65
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,340
Are zombies supposed to be this full of life?

66
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,470
Teach them just how
dangerous zombies can be!

67
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,010
What, you wanna fight?

68
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,430
We can teach you a thing or two
about how dangerous we are!

69
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,780
600 Million Berry Jackpot!

70
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,280
"His Name is Moria! The Great
Shadow-Seizing Pirate's Trap!"

71
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,250
So... what were you guys doing here?

72
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,880
Well... We are zombies,
so we were kinda buried...

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,920
And we were kinda rotting...

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,840
Right, right. I was rotting.

75
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,260
Yeah, so was I.

76
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,050
Are you trying to be funny?

77
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,600
No, no! Not by any means!

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,220
We're sorry! Honest!

79
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,710
That right? Then I have a question for you.

80
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,020
Did a man with a long nose,
a woman with orange hair,

81
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,740
and a raccoon dog that resembles
a reindeer pass through here?

82
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,410
Huh?! Uh, y-yeah... Yes, yes, and yes.

83
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,240
Maybe I saw them, maybe I didn't...

84
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,410
But our lips are sealed!

85
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,830
We aren't allowed to share information
on that topic with outsiders.

86
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,960
It's the rule.

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,290
Right, right!

88
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,210
Yeah?

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:11,840
It's the rule! It's the rule!
It's the rule! It's the rule!...

90
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,930
So you absolutely refuse to talk, huh?

91
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,230
All three of them passed through!

92
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,440
They squealed like pigs!

93
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,110
That was fast...

94
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,490
They're my crewmates.
You didn't go after them, did you?

95
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,430
Huh?!

96
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,570
Th-They're your crewmates?

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,780
I-I didn't attack them! Right?

98
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,080
Y-Yeah. S-Same goes for me.

99
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't attack them!

100
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,400
We didn't attack them! We didn't
attack them! We didn't attack them!

101
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,970
You'd better tell me the truth.

102
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,970
He attacked them!

103
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,510
What?! Hey, you don't sell friends out!

104
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,970
You nibbled on him a bit, remember?

105
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,350
We all attacked them together.

106
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,140
Stupid! Don't tell him that!

107
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,180
Nami and the other two
apparently raced for that mansion.

108
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm glad they're okay!

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,510
But they didn't know anything about Brook.

110
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,930
Do we really need him? Forget that weirdo!

111
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,960
Yeah, really.

112
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,540
But man, those were some spineless zombies!

113
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,580
Yeah! That didn't even count as a warm-up!

114
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,240
But don't let your guard down.

115
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,830
We have no idea what could be
lurking around the next corner.

116
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,930
What's this? Starting to
chicken out, Swordswuss?

117
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,390
Shut up, you stupid cook!

118
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,140
Don't lump me together with you!

119
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,480
What was that, Disoriented Moss Head?!

120
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,350
Wanna fight, Curly Eyebrow?!

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,980
P-Please hold up!

122
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,830
I saw what you just did!
You're terribly strong, aren't you?

123
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,670
Could you please hear me out?

124
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,790
A severely injured old man?

125
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,630
We've told you before, that's a zombie!

126
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,760
No, I'm a severely injured old man.

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,220
That's confusing! Just pass
yourself off as a zombie!

128
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,510
So what did you wanna discuss?

129
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,890
There is a man I would like you to defeat.

130
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm sure you could take him down!
He has created countless victims,

131
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,900
all of whom could be saved
if you defeated him!

132
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,820
If I get my shadow back,
I'll do anything I can to thank you!

133
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,070
Your shadow?

134
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,870
So what? Are you another
person who lost his shadow?

135
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,990
Your shadow...?

136
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,540
It's true!

137
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,460
Gramps, you don't have a shadow!

138
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,570
You're just like Brook.

139
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,870
So who the heck stole it?

140
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,130
Who is on this island?

141
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,820
M-Moria...

142
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,070
The man's name is Moria.
He is truly terrifying.

143
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,310
Moria?

144
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,410
By any chance...

145
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Are you referring to Gecko Moria?

146
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,590
Yeah, that's him. That's the Moria I meant.

147
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,130
Robin, do you know him?

148
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,180
I know his name well.

149
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,300
That man's bounty used to
surpass even yours, Luffy.

150
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,390
It used to? So that means...

151
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,590
Right... Gecko Moria

152
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,350
is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

153
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,150
One of the Seven Warlords?!

154
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,860
Are you sure, Robin?

155
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,120
Yes... Gecko Moria is a man
shrouded in mystery.

156
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,870
But what is that man doing
in a place like this?

157
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,330
I'm afraid I don't know. But there
are more than a few victims

158
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,040
left to wander this forest
after he stole their shadows.

159
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,300
There are other people here?

160
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,760
Yeah. You would be wise to remember

161
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,180
that Moria has had his eye on you
ever since he invited you here.

162
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,590
He invited us...?

163
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,350
"Offering of Treasure to the Sea God"

164
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,060
So that's the deal?

165
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,980
Those who stayed must creep around
the forest in fear of the zombies.

166
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,700
Those who took to the sea must
spend their lives in fear of the sun.

167
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,710
Either way, it hardly feels
like we're even alive anymore.

168
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,300
At the very least, I wish that
just once--once is all I ask for--

169
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,380
I could walk under the light of the sun!

170
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,170
That's your story? Dude, that sounds killer!

171
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,750
All right! I'll help ya out!

172
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,090
Don't worry about a thing, stupid!
You idiot, I'm not crying!

173
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,470
You're way too easy to read.

174
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,800
Don't be so quick to take on
someone else's problems.

175
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
You heard him!

176
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,440
Hey, geezer! Only ladies can
use tears to win people over!

177
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,440
You can't make my heart throb!

178
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,820
That's just so...

179
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:46,370
But, hey, I was searching
for the shadow thief.

180
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,790
If he's after us, we're gonna
have to kick his butt anyway.

181
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,330
So wouldn't we wind up
helping you on the side?

182
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,690
Get it?

183
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,090
I'm happy to hear you say that!

184
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,840
Even if we're on the side,
it still gives us hope!

185
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,840
We're counting on you, Mister!

186
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,680
Best of luck!

187
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,180
Kick Moria's stinky butt!

188
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,020
What the heck?! The other victims
were listening in on us?!

189
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,270
Yeah! Excuse us for not making
your heart throb, Curly Eyebrow!

190
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,820
Shut up! Leave me alone!

191
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,870
Who's there?!

192
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,420
"Evil Be Gone"

193
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,060
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

194
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,080
What are you doing here?!

195
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:54,390
"Evil Be Gone"

196
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,390
What was with that "yo ho ho"?!
Was that Brook just now?

197
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,560
But he wasn't a skeleton!
He had skin and muscle.

198
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,780
Plus he was wearing sandals
and carrying a katana.

199
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,190
How dare they blow me off?!

200
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,580
You're right! He was wearing
a completely different outfit.

201
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,630
What's that mean?

202
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,610
Infidels!

203
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,450
He found us!

204
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,580
What did you see?

205
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,560
I made it perfectly clear to
keep your noses out of my lab!

206
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,080
I-I-I didn't see a thing!

207
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,540
N-Neither did I!

208
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,510
Uh-huh! I didn't see anything either.

209
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,420
Honest?

210
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,140
C-Cross my heart! I swear I didn't
see a zombie in the works!

211
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,100
Don't say that!

212
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,780
Well, it's all good.

213
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,020
It doesn't matter what secrets
you uncover. It's too late anyway.

214
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,440
In a couple of minutes...

215
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,530
...the "night raid" will begin!

216
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,750
"Night raid"?

217
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,850
We round up the unsuspecting guests
who wander onto this island.

218
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,000
Then the night raid begins!

219
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,760
They just had to rebury the zombies
right before the night raid!

220
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,780
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

221
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,900
You couldn't feel something
even if it was itchy, hot, or painful!

222
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,320
You're all dead!

223
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,310
Right...

224
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,000
Now get up, Soldier Zombies!

225
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,270
No matter how many times you're defeated,
you can rise and attack again!

226
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,330
That is what makes zombies truly terrifying!

227
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,840
Yeah!

228
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,180
What a pain...

229
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,660
Hey, get your act together!

230
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,730
Give me a break, zombies!

231
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,900
I dare you to say who I am!

232
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,320
You're our leader!

233
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,700
You're our leader, Absalom!

234
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:03,290
Leader! Leader! Leader! Leader!

235
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:09,500
Leader! Leader! Leader! Leader!...

236
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,660
Peeping Tom!

237
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,370
Erotic Leader! Erosalom! Erosalom! Eros!

238
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,370
--Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!...
--Shut up!

239
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,990
W-W-Welcome back, Perona-sama... in bulk!

240
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,910
Gah! Don't talk, Kumacy!

241
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,080
Why must you have such a deep voice
when you're so cute?! It's annoying!

242
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,960
I-I'm sorry.

243
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,390
If you aren't cute, you have
no right to serve me!

244
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,530
Hurry! Hurry!

245
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,190
It's starting! It's starting!

246
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,700
It's time for the night raid!

247
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,860
It's almost midnight!

248
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Master!

249
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,490
Moria-sama!

250
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,740
Time to wake up!

251
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,750
Nin, do it!

252
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,380
Okay, sure thing!

253
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,800
Master!

254
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,010
I was having a nightmare!

255
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,560
How dreadfully wonderful, Master!

256
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,560
It's been roughly four days
since our last night raid.

257
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,770
You've been asleep that
entire time, Moria-sama.

258
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,240
As such, we have prepared
four days' worth of food for you.

259
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,610
We have some impressive prey this time!

260
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,410
After toppling Enies Lobby,
they've become a hot topic!

261
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,290
They're Straw Hat Luffy and his gang!

262
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,420
I'm sure you will find
use for them, Moria-sama.

263
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,260
Rain?

264
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,090
It's coming down pretty heavy.

265
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,930
All right! Let's run for the mansion.

266
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,930
Just a sec!

267
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,150
I can see somethin' huge behind the mansion.

268
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,480
It's like some kinda massive mark.

269
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,190
A mark?

270
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,860
The fog has cleared up a bit, hasn't it?

271
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,660
What is that? A flag?

272
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,620
No! Isn't that a sail?

273
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,090
A sail?!

274
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,080
It sure is!

275
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,790
You're still following us?!

276
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,250
What did you mean?

277
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,740
Just as that man said, it's a sail.

278
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,910
But it's so large that you
can't see the whole thing.

279
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,810
Thriller Bark is carrying an entire village,

280
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,310
making it the largest
pirate ship in the world!

281
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,770
It's a pirate ship that
hauls around a village?!

282
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,070
It's the largest in the world...

283
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,100
Awesome!

284
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,780
Makes sense. "Bark" is definitely a word
used to define a type of sailing ship.

285
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,370
But I never thought I'd see a
ship carry an entire village...

286
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,750
You can see how the main mast
connects to the back of the mansion.

287
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,460
That is where you will find Gecko Moria.

288
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,560
Now then, my Soldier Zombie Corps!

289
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,690
The General Zombies will
take those pirates down!

290
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,540
No matter how many times they defeat you,

291
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,400
stand back up and renew your attack!

292
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,070
Drive them into a corner with
your terrifying immortality!

293
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,530
Well, the clock has struck midnight.

294
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,410
It's time for us to go all out.

295
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,040
Don't count on escaping us, foolish pirates!

296
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,330
Are you ready, zombies?

297
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,790
Yeah!

298
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:53,180
This is the land of the
deceased, Thriller Bark!

299
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,730
May you have unpleasant nightmares!

300
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,050
Well, shall we go?

301
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,910
It's a haunted mansion!

302
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,520
It has finally begun, Absalom!

303
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,430
Right! It's time for the night raid!

304
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,800
The night raid!

305
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,140
Go on a rampage, General Zombies!

306
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,630
A-A night raid!

307
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

308
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,190
"Feast of the Zombie Song! The Night
Raid's Bell is the Sound of Darkness!"

309
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,250
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
