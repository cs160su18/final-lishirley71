2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,250
H-Here's my new weapon, Kuwagata!

48
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,900
So are you all set, Usopp?

49
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,030
Y-Yeah, but I only made this to look cool!

50
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,120
I have no idea how it will actually work!

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,950
All right! Aim for the
center of that lug's gut!

52
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,880
Go! Special Attack! Iron Man Comet!

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,550
Eat this, Moria!

54
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,290
Tch!

55
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,100
Franky!

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,650
You're not done yet, Oars.
He's still hanging on by a thread.

57
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,150
Finish him off!

58
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,240
Okay!

59
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,920
Thunderbolt...

60
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,130
Huh? That cloud...!

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,470
...Tempo!

62
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,020
Damn it! Who did that?!

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,110
What did they do?!

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,030
Nami-san!

65
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,120
Hey! Quit yelling my name!

66
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,290
What if he notices me?!

67
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,330
Gum-Gum...

68
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,000
Wh-What? What? What?! Can he stretch?

69
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,090
...Pistol!

70
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,390
What?!

71
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,810
H-His arm extended?! Why?!

72
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,150
It stretched. That feels
more like how it should.

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,870
"The Straw Hat Crew Gets Wiped Out!
The Shadow-Shadow's Powers in Full Swing!"

74
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,460
Gum-Gum...

75
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,170
Incoming!

76
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,920
...Bell!

77
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,770
I'm in the groove now that my body stretches.

78
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,810
Gum-Gum...

79
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,020
Here comes another attack!

80
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,650
...Spear!

81
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,290
Damn it! What is going on here?

82
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,310
His attack power has skyrocketed!

83
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,950
How come Oars can stretch
when he isn't a power holder?

84
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,210
What did Moria do?

85
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,760
Good guess! I'm making you live this
nightmare with my Shadow-Shadow power...

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,810
...Shadow Revolution!

87
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,610
R-Revolution?

88
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,780
Shadows copy whatever your body does.
That's common knowledge!

89
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,330
Your body and shadow are always
mirror images of each other.

90
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,130
That is a hard-and-fast rule.

91
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,830
Oars' shadow is supposed to obey him,

92
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,550
but I usurped control by
slipping my shadow inside of it.

93
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,670
Do you know what that means?

94
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,810
I can freely alter the shape of Oars' shadow.

95
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,270
But his shadow and body
must take the same form.

96
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,190
Since the shadow stops
matching the shape of his body,

97
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,440
his body transforms to match his shadow.

98
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,360
That is how Shadow Revolution works!

99
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,280
In other words, it's the
opposite of common sense.

100
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,110
Moria made the arms and legs
in Oars' shadow extend,

101
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,860
so his body stretched to match.

102
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,080
So instead of becoming a rubber man,
Oars' body can transform into anything?

103
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,460
Give me a break. He's too big for that.

104
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,260
Yeah. I can't get near him like this.

105
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,260
This is far worse than rubber!

106
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,060
If I make his shadow round...

107
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,600
Oars will turn into a ball!

108
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,310
No way...!

109
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,700
What... is he doing?!

110
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,190
Ow, ow, ow!

111
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,910
I-Is this for real?

112
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,580
Oars Ball!

113
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,500
Eat this!

114
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,250
Whoa...

115
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,210
Run for it!

116
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,180
Hey, now! Just a sec, Master.

117
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,920
Keep out of my fight!

118
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,320
My bad! I didn't mean to interfere.

119
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,980
I'm just here to offer assistance.

120
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,490
Go on, Oars! Crush each
and every one of them!

121
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,240
By the way, where is Luffy?

122
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,790
Moria must have tricked him
into going somewhere!

123
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,200
There is no way he got his butt kicked!

124
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,940
Seriously? I swear, he is such an idiot!

125
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,210
What should I do? Should I tell everyone?

126
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,550
We're already in a tight spot...

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,210
Do they need to know

128
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,130
that there is another Warlord
on this island right now?

129
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,390
So does this mean everyone
won't get their shadows back

130
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,770
unless we defeat both Zombie Luffy and Moria?

131
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,560
Yeah, that sounds about right.

132
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,020
No way! It's almost dawn!

133
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,150
That's part of the enemy's plan!
We just have to thwart it!

134
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,440
--Excuse me!
--What?

135
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,550
Skeleton, you're here?

136
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,060
Please...

137
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,870
Please grant me this one request!

138
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,270
Huh?

139
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,420
You shouldn't get near him, Zoro!

140
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,980
Thank you so much, everyone!

141
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,180
This is nothing.

142
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Have you lost your mind, Brook?

143
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,560
Didn't you see what happened to Franky?

144
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,030
Don't blame me for what happens!
This packs a wallop, so get ready!

145
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,440
Dark Cloud Tempo!

146
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,910
Go ahead! Please do your thing!

147
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,370
I didn't think I'd use Kuwagata again!

148
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,580
There is no greater pain than
being unable to repay a favor!

149
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,630
I shall put in backbreaking effort!

150
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,090
Okay! Then off you go!

151
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,050
I'm off!

152
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,780
Slalom Vine!

153
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,560
The electricity is so strong
you can see my bones!

154
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,070
But I was nothing but bones to begin with!

155
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,240
It's show time! I'm like a lightning arrow!

156
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,650
Lightning Bone Sword...

157
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,020
Gavotte Bond en Avant!

158
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Awesome! He drilled through.

159
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,080
He went through my body!

160
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,500
He made an opening! Keep the attacks going!

161
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,540
Mission: Complete...

162
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,800
Well done, Bones!

163
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,800
Two-Sword Style... Nigiri...

164
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,310
...Tower Climb!

165
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,190
Why, you--no, first I'm going
to finish off that skeleton.

166
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,530
Gum-Gum...

167
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,860
H-He wouldn't...!

168
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,740
...Battle Axe!

169
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,870
Brook...!

170
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,330
Brook!

171
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,050
Special Attack! Atlas Comet!

172
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,260
That won't work!

173
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,520
--Crap!
--Usopp, fight!

174
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,560
"Fight"? Eh? Hey! Whoa, wait!

175
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:42,490
You're up next, Long Nose!

176
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,160
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

177
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,540
I'm dead!

178
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,030
Huh? Huh?

179
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,630
My arm isn't stretching! Why not?

180
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,310
Ochenta Fleurs Cuatro Mano!

181
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,730
Where did these arms come from?!
They're annoying!

182
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,700
Could you stop manipulating
his shadow for the time being?

183
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,160
What?!

184
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,070
Hold!

185
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,880
G-Gak! C-Can't breathe!

186
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,410
Keep it up, Robin!

187
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,730
Do you think this will
keep me out of the fight?

188
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,190
Your plan doesn't amuse me in the least!

189
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,820
Brick Bat.

190
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,270
Robin-chan!

191
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,610
Veinte Fleurs!

192
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,730
Calendula!

193
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,280
Robin!

194
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,650
What do you think you're
doing to Robin-chan?!

195
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,730
Moria's shadow?!

196
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,200
Let's see who is the more powerful
long-distance power holder!

197
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,280
Your hold hurts pretty darn bad!

198
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,030
Don't get distracted by his shadow!

199
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,160
If we take out his body,
the shadow will disappear as well.

200
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,750
Cuatro Mano!

201
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,600
H-Hey!

202
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,760
What are you doing?! Stop it!

203
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,060
Clutch!

204
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,930
No!

205
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,350
--Sweet!
--You're amazing, Robin!

206
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,150
Hey, Robin! Watch out
for the shadow behind you!

207
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,530
Huh? What is Moria doing down here?

208
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,620
You were close! It's such a pity.

209
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,000
Doppelman and I can switch
places at any given minute.

210
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,540
They switched places?

211
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,050
Huh? Then the one inside Oars is...?

212
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,010
My Shadow Substitute that
has no joints to dislocate!

213
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,770
That's right! It's the shadow that
was here until just a second ago.

214
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,400
Robin-chan!

215
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,860
That's three down!

216
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,990
Now he's got Robin's shadow!

217
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,280
I don't have anything to put it in,
but I might as well take it.

218
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,040
Diable Jambe!

219
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,130
You damn bastard!

220
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,410
Give Robin-chan's shadow back!

221
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,650
Extra Haché!

222
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,390
Brick Bat!

223
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,640
He switched places with his shadow again!

224
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,970
If he switched with his shadow...

225
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,100
Moria is back inside Oars' stomach!

226
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,330
And everything has returned to how it was.

227
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,460
Gosh darn it, Master!

228
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,330
This is supposed to be my fight!

229
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,460
I'm sorry, Oars. I had a bit
too much fun with them.

230
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,340
Huh?

231
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,600
I'll finish off that woman.

232
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,840
Gum-Gum...

233
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,040
His arms can stretch out again!

234
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,530
Shoot! He's going to attack
Robin when she's out cold!

235
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,160
Sanji! Robin! Run for it!

236
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,500
...Bazooka!

237
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,330
Diable Jambe!

238
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,080
Frit Assorti!

239
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,710
Huh?

240
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,430
You repelled him!

241
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,420
Now's your chance!
Get Robin-chan away from here.

242
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,900
You can count on me!

243
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,270
Hey! Sanji! Zoro!

244
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,830
Chopper, what are you doing up there?

245
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,620
I've been searching for what
caused Oars to die 500 years ago!

246
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
His cause of death?

247
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,040
Go after his right arm!

248
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,460
This isn't his real arm!

249
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,420
Hogback reconstructed it, but there are signs

250
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,810
of horrible frostbite around the stitches.

251
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,930
I can't say for certain, but I suspect
he froze to death 500 years ago!

252
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,850
Even a monster like this is
no match for the elements.

253
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,600
He died while wandering the Land of Ice!

254
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,910
Even 500 years ago,
I'd wager Oars went around...

255
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,110
...mostly naked!

256
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,490
I don't wanna lose to someone that stupid!

257
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,200
Zombies may not feel pain,
but they still take damage.

258
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,080
All of the attacks we've
landed are accumulating!

259
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,040
If we can render this arm nonfunctional,
it will halve his offensive power!

260
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,880
Long story short, focus on this one arm!

261
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,010
Why are you talking up a storm...

262
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,380
...while standing on my shoulder?!

263
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,220
Chopper!

264
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,760
Huh?

265
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,200
He's gone!

266
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,650
Since you're a zombie,
you have no idea how badly

267
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,910
you just hurt your own body
with that punch, do you?

268
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,830
Huh? Oh, you went inside my fist!

269
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:15,410
Heh! I'm tiny, so the crevices
in your fist are like caves!

270
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,340
Rumble!

271
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,420
Jumping Point!

272
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,250
Arm Point!

273
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,060
Chopper!

274
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,970
Glad you dodged that!

275
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,680
I'll lend you a hand!

276
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,180
Sanji, please do!

277
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,670
Armée de l'Air...

278
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,500
Cloven...

279
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,810
Roseo Shoot!

280
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,110
You jerks!

281
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,130
Stop hitting me in the same spot!

282
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,380
Those attacks aren't going to work.

283
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,710
They'll work! Pain is a signal
meant to protect the body!

284
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,590
Lacking pain doesn't make you strong!

285
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,780
Chopper!

286
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Save your fuzzy logic!

287
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,140
Hey! That looks bad, guys!
Get away from there!

288
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,350
Gum-Gum...

289
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,330
Now we're in for it.

290
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,800
Shoot!

291
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,690
...Gatling!

292
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,870
Sanji! Chopper!

293
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,750
There go another two...

294
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,330
He's taking everyone out...

295
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,280
Darn it!

296
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,910
Four down! Five down!

297
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,580
Three to go!

298
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,800
I have no idea who you are,
but thanks for rescuing me!

299
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,470
So who the heck are you?!

300
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,550
Monkey D. Luffy.

301
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,260
Don't lie!

302
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,430
It really is me.

303
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,310
What the heck happened to you?!

304
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,520
And you're stinking strong now!

305
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

306
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,230
"The Incredible Battle
Starts! Luffy vs. Luffy!"

307
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
