Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,380
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:21,020
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,310
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:31,310
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,410
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,540
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,880
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,320
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,790
I will definitely get you there.

22
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,740
Don't die... Nami... Sanji...!

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,690
"The Island Where Snow Lives!
Climb The Drum Rockies!"

24
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,480
Ahhh! Please look at that!
We found them, Wapol-sama!

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Hold it, brat!

26
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,160
Huh? You guys're...

27
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,030
How dare you do
many rude things to me!

28
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,100
I'll chew you guys up!

29
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,080
Get out of my way.

30
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,990
Humph! You're stupid, aren't you?

31
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,620
Why would I get out of your way?!

32
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,090
Looks like what you have on your
back and in your arm are half-dead.

33
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,720
Hold it!

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,260
Oh, I know!

35
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,430
Chess! I thought up a new law.
Write this down.

36
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,190
Yes sir!

37
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,890
Those who ignore the king
are to be executed!

38
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,350
Ignoring me already?!

39
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,270
Guys! First, get the sick and injured ones,
who are ignoring me the most!

40
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,170
--Yes sir!
--Yes sir!

41
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,240
What'd you say?!

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,710
I'll take the woman on his back!

43
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,530
I'll take the man.

44
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,880
Take this! Marimo's Surprise!

45
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,220
Listen Luffy!

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,690
Don't you dare fight.

47
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,190
Whether you attack or get struck,

48
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,260
Nami-san will feel the whole impact too!

49
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,360
Damn you! You'll regret this!

50
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,990
Don't follow me!

51
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,540
Humph. What a coward...

52
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,600
It's no use.

53
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,990
I'll show him...

54
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,730
what a battle in a snowy area is like...

55
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,190
Huh...?

56
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,430
There's no one...

57
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,850
What's going on?

58
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,430
I wonder if they've already given up...

59
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,070
Now this is a true battle in a snowy area!

60
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,570
The white disguise!
Snow Powder Makeup!

61
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,200
Since they're so weak,
they'll be dead with just one shot.

62
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,120
Check Mate!

63
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,490
Stop it!

64
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,460
White bears...

65
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,390
Lapins?!

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,370
Did they protect him?

67
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,100
It's a coincidence.
Lapins never become attached to humans.

68
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,080
You are...

69
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,380
Thanks! You saved me!

70
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,830
Don't let him get away!

71
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,730
Yes sir!

72
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,270
What the hell do they
think they're doing?!

73
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,600
Doctor...

74
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,360
Doctor...

75
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,890
Doctor...

76
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,550
So this is it...

77
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,200
I can't see the top.

78
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,370
I can find the doctor... up there...

79
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,510
Hang in there a little longer...

80
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,890
Nami! Sanji!

81
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,560
Avalanche...

82
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,850
We were swallowed by the avalanche...

83
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,840
Ah! U... Usopp-san?!

84
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,960
Usopp-san!

85
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,730
Usopp-san! Come on!

86
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,460
Wake up!

87
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,470
He's still alive!

88
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,350
Usopp-san! Hang on!

89
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,870
Come on! Usopp-san!

90
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,410
Usopp-san!

91
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,830
Oh Vivi... Don't wake me up.

92
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,900
I was just having a beautiful dream.

93
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,650
A field of beautiful flowers out of
this world and a beautiful river... Oh?

94
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,950
--You're almost in the netherworld!
--Isn't that Zoro swimming in the river...?

95
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,830
--Wake up! Don't sleep! Wake up!
--Isn't that Zoro swimming in the river...?

96
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,730
All 74,000 Usopp Pirates, close in!

97
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,220
No! Wake up! Usopp-san, don't die!

98
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,900
Usopp-san!

99
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,530
Usopp-san! Usopp-san! Usopp-san!
Usopp-san! Usopp-san! Usopp-san!

100
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,440
Phew, you saved me, Vivi.

101
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Talk about having a
narrow escape from death.

102
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,820
I'm glad I'm alive. But...

103
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,680
--don't you think my face is kinda swollen?

104
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,950
--I-it's chilblains! Chilblains!
--don't you think my face is kinda swollen?

105
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,750
--I-it's chilblains! Chilblains!
--My head feels kinda heavy...

106
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,120
--This is why it's not easy
to be in a snowy area.
--My head feels kinda heavy...

107
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,390
--This is why it's not easy
to be in a snowy area.
--Or should I say my view is kinda narrow...

108
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,360
--More importantly,
--Or should I say my view is kinda narrow...

109
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,820
--we have to figure out our location
and the situation we're in quickly!
--Or should I say my view is kinda narrow...

110
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,750
--we have to figure out our location
and the situation we're in quickly!
--My lips are kinda big... Kinda...

111
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,790
--we have to figure out our location
and the situation we're in quickly!
--yeah, I agree...

112
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,210
Ahhh! What's that?!

113
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,470
Ahhh... That was close...
I saw a field of flowers...

114
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,210
Suddenly hitting an avalanche in
this cold... I must've run out of luck.

115
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,150
But this is a sort of
winter swimming, I guess.

116
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,910
Zoro.

117
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,850
Hm? Oh, Vivi.

118
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,060
Huh?

119
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,000
Hm?

120
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,360
Oh, it's you, Usopp!
What're you guys doing here?

121
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,170
That's my question!

122
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,420
What idiots!

123
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,670
That's what you lowly bunnies
get for going against the king!

124
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,710
Humph! I didn't think I'd use my
real power on mere bunnies, though.

125
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,250
It couldn't be helped...

126
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,100
since they're the most
violent animal in Drum.

127
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,060
Just wait...

128
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,420
Straw Hat!

129
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,290
Doctor...!

130
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,690
Doctor...!

131
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,080
Doctor...!

132
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,210
Ah! Ow!

133
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,950
Sanji!

134
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,730
Th-that... that was close...

135
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,410
Winter swimming?!

136
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,110
Yeah. After swimming
in the river for a while,

137
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,650
I had no idea where I was any more.

138
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,650
So I was walking while
doing muscle training,

139
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,450
and then I ended up in a forest.

140
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,490
Dressed like that?
You're stupid, aren't you?

141
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,640
Anyway, give me your coat, Usopp.

142
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,340
No way.

143
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,810
Nami-san might've gotten sick
due to mental exhaustion...

144
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,170
--Then your shoes!

145
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,270
--No!
--Then your shoes!

146
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,570
--No!
--One of them!

147
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,930
--No!
--One of them!

148
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,300
It's your own fault, isn't it?!

149
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,300
Look over there! There're people.

150
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,050
Hm?

151
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,010
Hey... I remember those buildings...

152
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,810
What?

153
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,150
You're right! This is Big Horn!

154
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,660
We ended up... coming back!

155
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,410
Step back! Step back!

156
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,200
Dalton is already dead!

157
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,230
There's no way Dalton-san
would die from an attack like that!

158
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,090
You guys're Dalton-san's
ex-subordinates, aren't you?!

159
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,670
Don't you care?!

160
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,710
We're retainers of King Wapol!

161
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,380
If you become Wapol-sama's enemy,
you're dead meat!

162
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,990
Hey, what's the matter?

163
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,590
Wh-what's the matter?

164
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,100
What's the matter with you,
dressing like that?!

165
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,850
Dalton-san's buried under
the snow of the avalanche!

166
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,640
What?!

167
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,440
Dalton-san is?!

168
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,190
Yeah. We can't dig him out
because those guys get in our way.

169
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,420
Step back! Step back!

170
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,420
If you have any objection,
go right ahead and bring it on!

171
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,770
Usopp, I remember their clothes.

172
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,390
They're the ones who attacked
us on the sea, right? Right?!

173
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,630
Yeah, that's right.

174
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,720
Then they're our enemy, aren't they?

175
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,360
They're our enemy, right?
What's the word? Are they on our side?!

176
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,680
Well, they're our enemy...
but why are you so...

177
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,450
You aren't so courageous
without Dalton, are you?

178
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,900
What?! Mr. Bushido!

179
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,110
Who's that?!

180
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,740
Hey you! Stop it!
If you attack them, you'll...

181
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,700
This is warm! I'm borrowing it!

182
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,660
You... asked me because of that...?!

183
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,950
--Look! They're angry!

184
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,080
--You!
--Look! They're angry!

185
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,620
You were on the ship with that
guy who blew Wapol-sama away!

186
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,080
Oh? You guys never learn, do you?

187
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,110
Are you guys looking for...

188
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,150
these?

189
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,690
Bring him down!

190
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,090
Hawk Wave!

191
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,690
Oh, it's already over?

192
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,230
What a disappointing bunch...

193
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,280
Amazing...

194
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,400
All right! Good job, Zoro!

195
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,440
Just as I instructed!

196
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,830
Let's find Dalton-san!

197
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,730
Yeah!

198
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,420
Thank you!

199
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,200
Hurry up! Dig everywhere!

200
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,760
So, what's all this fuss?

201
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,990
I'll explain it later! Let's help them!

202
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,180
Dalton-san! Please be alive!

203
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,380
Doctor...

204
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,990
Doctor...

205
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,110
Doctor...

206
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,590
Hang in there. We're almost there.

207
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,960
Don't you die on me!

208
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,900
We made it...

209
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,240
Doctor...

210
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,130
Doctorine...
The antibodies are responding.

211
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah, I figured that much.

212
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,950
Then, what's the cause? Explain.

213
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,980
Kestia...

214
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,840
That's right. Kestia.

215
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,510
You attend the girl.

216
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,310
Okay.

217
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,310
Who are you?

218
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:24,490
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

219
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

220
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:47,130
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

221
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:57,610
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

222
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

223
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,310
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

224
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

225
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,820
Hey wait, reindeer!

226
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,180
Don't run away, meat!

227
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,620
Hold on, Nami-san! I'll cook a
nutritious reindeer dish right away!

228
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,020
I don't care about the food.
I just want some peace and quiet.

229
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,480
Huh? Wasn't that reindeer speaking?

230
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,600
Come to think of it, I sort of
remember him standing on two legs.

231
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,810
He's a monster!

232
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

233
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,400
"Blue-nosed Reindeer!
Chopper's Secret"

234
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
