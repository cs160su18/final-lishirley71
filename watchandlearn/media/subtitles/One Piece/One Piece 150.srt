00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,630
Gold bells and a bird...

20
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,590
Do you suppose they
were symbols of old Jaya?

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,550
Dunno, but I think they were
part of some sort of model.

22
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,720
This here's called a South Bird,
and they still exist on this island!

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,980
Oh! Do they have weird calls?

24
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,690
Yep. Just like the logbook says!

25
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,110
Sailors have long used South Birds to...

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,160
Oh, crap!

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,380
What is it?! What's wrong?!

28
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,570
Go catch this bird! Right now!

29
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,090
Why?! What for?!

30
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,330
Why do we need a bird?

31
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,610
Listen closely! The Knock-Up Stream
you're heading for tomorrow

32
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,950
is located directly south of this cape.

33
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,300
How are you going to get there?!

34
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,590
Once you're on the open sea,
there's no way to get your bearings!

35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,720
That's right!

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,280
We're heading for ocean, not an island,
so we have no guide to rely on!

37
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,780
So you'll use the bird's behavior for that!

38
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,930
I heard the sad tale of your
Montblanc family at the pub.

39
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,730
It moved me, Cricket.

40
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,200
Treasure someone else struggled to
get has a special flavor all its own!

41
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,350
Wanna know what people call me?

42
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,810
The Hyena!

43
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,390
"Dreams Don't Come True?!
Bellamy versus the Saruyama Alliance"

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,970
Here they come! Dodge!

45
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,000
These praying mantises aren't normal!

46
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,460
Our net!

47
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,040
What's with this forest?!

48
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,660
It's him!

49
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,540
What do you mean?!

50
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,560
The South Bird is the bugs' control tower!

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,780
Why is a bird controlling bugs?!

52
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,310
They're here! Where's it coming from?!

53
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,560
What's that? I hear something different...

54
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,810
Up ahead!

55
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,000
Huh? Boulders?

56
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,280
They're rolling this way!

57
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,380
Is it dung beetle dung?!

58
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,910
No! They're bugs!

59
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,960
Ladybugs!

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,670
They're huge! Oww!

61
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,290
Damn things!

62
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,990
There's no end to 'em!

63
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,490
Why is your mole cricket army attacking me?!

64
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,410
You're in the way! Do you
think you can beat me?! Huh?!

65
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,160
I can hear it, but I can't see it...

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,500
S-Slug!

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,040
Salt! Throw salt!

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,470
Sanji! Your Somersault Kick!

69
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,010
Alright! Not that kind of "salt"!

70
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,510
I'm sick of running! Bring it on!

71
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,790
No, Luffy! Bear-bees are really poisonous!

72
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,820
Fireflies!

73
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,290
So pretty!

74
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,840
Cockroaches!

75
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,500
Pigs!

76
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,740
We gladly accept fights people pick with us!

77
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,470
Don't underestimate the Saruyama Alliance!

78
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,490
Get 'em!

79
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,470
Hand over your gold quietly,
or else you're gonna pay dearly!

80
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,970
How do you figure?

81
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,380
O-Old man!

82
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,560
Monkey Punch!

83
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,740
You know it's dangerous for kids
to swing stuff like that around!

84
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,870
Well then, I guess we should
get this midnight show started!

85
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,950
Spring...

86
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,600
...Snipe!

87
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,140
Way to go, Bellamy! Yay!

88
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,620
What do you think of our captain's
"Spring-Spring Fruit" powers?

89
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,240
Speechless, huh?

90
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,300
Clean up the trash! Take care of 'em!

91
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,010
So much for your Saruyama Alliance!

92
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,730
You're just an old man and
a couple of overgrown apes!

93
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,980
Jackpot, Bellamy!

94
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,860
This is definitely it!

95
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,700
Oh! Would you look at that?
Wonderful gold bullion!

96
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,500
There's more! Wow!

97
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,380
This's a big haul!

98
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,820
You guys... aren't qualified to have that gold...!

99
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,810
Qualified?

100
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,250
Is this qualified enough for ya?!

101
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,260
Big Chop!

102
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,980
You fool...

103
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,190
We're way stronger than you are!

104
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,830
How much more qualified do we
need to be to steal treasure?!

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,530
Well, old man?!

106
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,650
Watch out, old-timer!

107
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,320
Havoc Sonar!

108
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,190
Bastard!

109
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,220
Wait, Sarquiss!

110
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,930
I'll end his life.

111
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,190
Not that again... The power
of the Spring-Spring Fruit...!

112
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,070
Run, Shojo!

113
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,530
Spring...

114
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,240
...Snipe!

115
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,070
Shojo!

116
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,100
Old-timer! We found gold! A bell-shaped ingot!

117
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,000
Look! It matches what's listed
in the logbook! It mentions bells!

118
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,880
Alright, let's go. Load the gold on board.

119
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,470
Grow up, old man!

120
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,070
This "city of gold" is just a
product of Noland's imagination!

121
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,290
If you wanna be a pirate
in the coming new era,

122
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,560
then you need to realize
that dreams never come true!

123
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,310
The city of gold does exist!

124
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,220
Hey, now! Don't go wild! It's a small house!

125
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,690
Wait, kiddo...

126
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,050
A hatchling who doesn't have the
guts to pick fights with dreams...

127
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,420
...is in no position to talk about pirates!

128
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,690
What was that?

129
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,830
No luck. We couldn't even see a single one...

130
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,890
We saw one, but there was no time
for the bird, with all those bugs...

131
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,260
All we did was run...

132
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,840
Yeesh! Seven people, and you get zilch?!
Get it together, you guys!

133
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,700
That includes you!

134
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,240
I can't run any more!

135
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,150
"You really think you can catch us? Idiots!"

136
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,530
What?! He came here to tell us that?!

137
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,940
Dammit! I'll shoot you good!

138
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,240
All I needed was to see one.

139
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,500
Old guy! We caught a bird!

140
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,510
Old diamond-head!

141
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,290
Masira!

142
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,620
Shojo!

143
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,300
What in the world happened?!

144
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,030
Damn! Who did this?!

145
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,310
Hey! Gimme a hand!

146
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,930
Right!

147
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,980
Look! The Going Merry...!

148
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,260
What the hell?! Who did this?!
Dammit! Who was it?!

149
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,910
Sorry...

150
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,480
Old guy!

151
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,960
Hey, old guy! Are you awake?!

152
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,580
I'm truly sorry!

153
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,450
There's nothing we could do! We're pathetic!

154
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:02,340
But... there's still time to
strengthen the ship before sunup...!

155
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,670
Wait, old guy! Tell us what happened first!

156
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,200
No... It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Doesn't matter now...

157
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,130
More importantly, you need to...

158
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,050
Ah! Great! You caught yourselves a South Bird!

159
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,520
Perfect!

160
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,650
Luffy!

161
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,390
The gold... It's been stolen!

162
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,580
Nah, it's alright... Forget about that junk...

163
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,200
You need to focus on...

164
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,550
What do you mean, "junk"?!

165
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,080
It took you ten long years
of diving into the ocean

166
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,590
and torturing your body
until you found that gold!

167
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,290
You can't just...

168
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,450
Quiet!

169
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,890
It's alright... This's our problem...

170
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,720
Listen!

171
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,690
If they all work on it, the Saruyama Alliance

172
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,900
can fix and reinforce that ship, no problem.

173
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,200
I'll have 'em finish in time for morning!

174
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,950
There won't be any trouble
with your departure tomorrow!

175
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,160
Listen! We will send you
into the sky, without fail!

176
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,840
Old-timer...

177
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,870
Hey, Luffy.

178
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,470
Bellamy's mark...

179
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,120
Want help?

180
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,060
No, I can do it alone.

181
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,060
No, Luffy! Don't be stupid!
We set sail in only three hours!

182
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,580
If I run along the coast, will I reach
the town from this afternoon?

183
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,970
Yes, you will.

184
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,450
Hey, kid! Where're you going?!

185
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,620
Don't be a fool! Do you
know who you're dealing--

186
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,490
If you wanna stop him, use this.

187
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,410
K-Kid...

188
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,190
I'll be back by morning!

189
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,850
I'm empty now! That's every
last drop of water in my body!

190
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,110
Now I won't sweat a single drop!

191
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,690
This ol' drunk is broke and dry!

192
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,130
O, God of Alcohol, thank you for today!

193
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,720
But I guess there's no such thing...

194
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,170
A newspaper?

195
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,880
Let's see! What bad news is there today?

196
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,260
Oh, this isn't a newspaper.
It's a stack of wanted posters...

197
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,220
Honestly, this is a lawless town!
I'm sick of meeting new bad guys!

198
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,930
This is that spineless kid from this afternoon!

199
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,940
Boy, that sky island talk was a real hoot!

200
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,890
Thirty million, I believe he was worth...

201
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,990
Crap! I had a little too much to drink!

202
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,830
Let's see...

203
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:23,700
1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
100,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000...

204
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,420
Yikes! I really did drink too much!

205
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:36,630
1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
100,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000...

206
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,510
...100,000,000!

207
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,130
Three hours, Luffy!

208
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,060
If we delay our departure any more than that...

209
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,640
...you'll lose your chance to go to the sky island!

210
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,600
He must've done reckless diving day after day

211
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,120
without letting those bubbles
disappear from his body!

212
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,590
This is a duel with the man
who screwed up my life.

213
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,430
Sorry! I'm truly sorry!

214
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,920
There's nothing we could do! We're pathetic!

215
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,390
Damn him!

216
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,490
Those big apes were hilarious!

217
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,820
They had huge gashes all over
and had tears and snot dripping down

218
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,240
as they cried, "Old-timer!"

219
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,960
If he's that important,
they should've protected him better!

220
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
Right?!

221
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,340
Talk about lame!

222
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,100
Don't be like that.

223
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,540
They couldn't help it; they were
up against you and Bellamy!

224
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,130
After all, our captain is a major
rookie worth 55 million berries!

225
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,640
Bad news!

226
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,460
What's the deal?! It's the middle of the night!

227
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,310
This afternoon! Those guys in here, they--!

228
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,970
Oh! Bellamy! You're still here?!

229
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,060
You gotta get out of here!
You're in the most danger!

230
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,400
What're you talking about? Me, in danger?

231
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,400
100 million...?!

232
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,990
60 million?!

233
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,220
That's right! Those two from this afternoon!

234
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,010
Their bounties are higher than yours, Bellamy!

235
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,420
You're dead meat!

236
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,060
Are you serious?! Crap!
We laughed at the wrong people!

237
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,550
Think they remember what we look like?!
It's dangerous to stay here!

238
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,610
I never met anyone with a 100 million bounty!

239
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,910
Hey, hey, hey! You fools!
Scared of a few scraps of paper!

240
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,240
Do you have knotholes for eyes?!
You saw their leader!

241
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,960
Made it!

242
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,770
Did you know that there were once pirates

243
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,210
who faked their own wanted posters
to make names for themselves?

244
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:19,440
People'd see their bounties
and just curl up and surrender,

245
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,030
even though they could've won in a fight...

246
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,170
Just like you guys now!

247
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,440
You saw how weak they are,
but look at you now! You're pathetic!

248
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,120
You're right! Boy, those
bastards had me scared!

249
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,380
Bellamy's right-- someone
with a bounty of 100 million

250
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,170
has gotta be involved
with some pretty bad stuff,

251
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,500
but then why hasn't he been in the papers?!

252
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,210
Definitely! I ain't heard of any straw hat kid!

253
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,520
Whew! Had me scared for a minute there!

254
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,350
Alright! Back to drinking! Cheers!

255
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,190
Bellamy! Where are you?!

256
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,700
To think he'd call me out...

257
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,740
Hey!

258
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,310
I just heard the rumors about you...

259
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,000
You got business with me?

260
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,060
Yeah! Give back old diamond-head's gold!

261
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:17,520
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

262
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:27,570
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

263
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,500
There are days where I almost lose to myself

264
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:51,930
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

265
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,060
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

266
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:08,400
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

267
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:17,250
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

268
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,370
This unique moment...

269
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,760
You said you were goin' to
a sky island. How'd it go?

270
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,370
I'm about to head into the sky...
after I beat you up!

271
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,680
All you ever say is dream-like crap...

272
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,640
If you want, I can make you
dream forever... in the afterlife!

273
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,600
So long, Straw Hat!

274
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,170
On the next episode of One Piece!

275
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,390
"100 Million Man! World's Greatest
Power and Pirate Blackbeard!"

276
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
