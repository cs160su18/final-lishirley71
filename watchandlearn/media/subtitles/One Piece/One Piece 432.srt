2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,990
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,610
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,570
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,520
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,320
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,760
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,650
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,400
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,030
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,200
He ran into Buggy and a former
Baroque Works agent - Mr. 3,

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,430
and together, they have reached level 3!

54
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,210
This is level 3 - the Starvation Hell!

55
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,160
We have to get away from here while
we still have sweat to spare.

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,170
Let's go to level 4 in hurry!

57
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,260
Seriously?!

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,010
Soup spaghetti!

59
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,470
The Sphinx is awake!

60
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,770
Deep-fried noodle!

61
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,190
Gum-Gum...

62
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,110
...Gatling!

63
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,240
Meanwhile, Hancock who helped
Luffy to sneak into the prison...

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,360
...is about to reach the floor
where Ace is being held.

65
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,160
Un, deux, come on!

66
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,440
--Un, deux, faint!
--Who's singing?

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,880
Un, deux, come on!

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Un, deux, faint!

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,500
Un, deux, come on!

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,220
"The Unleashed Swan! A
reunion with Bon Clay!"

71
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,750
Oh Come My Way!

72
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,570
Oh, oh! Oh Come My Way!

73
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,020
Yeah, yeah! Oh Come My Way!

74
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,910
I can barely stand in this Starvation
Hell but that guy's singing so happily.

75
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,460
If he's a prisoner, he sure is something!

76
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,000
Spin, spin! Oh Come My Way!

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,670
It sounds familiar! This must be...

78
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,340
Hey, partner! I think this guy can help us!

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,550
H-Hey! W-Wait a minute!

80
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,480
Yeah, yeah! Oh Come My Way!

81
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,600
Spin, spin! Oh Come My Way!

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,440
You guys are doing great!

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,740
I spin and spin like I'm caught
up in the tide of the times!

84
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,950
This way!

85
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,780
Wait! Listen to me! That's...

86
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,960
Guys! You can't be that tired!

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,920
It's not that hot!

88
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,670
I can make more people suffocate!

89
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,760
Oh! What's up, Mr. 3!

90
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,180
Just as I thought. It's you...

91
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,320
What?! Mr. 3?!

92
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,370
Hey, wait a minute! Why're you here?!

93
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,410
You're behind bars, so you've been caught?!

94
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,580
No, no. It's me who has been caught!

95
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,840
I was so surprised I had to do a double take
with an "Oh Come My Way" Kenpo called...

96
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,880
...Looking Back on that Autumn Night's Dream!

97
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,100
Hey! What kind of animal is this?!

98
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Let's be sure to not let him out.

99
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,110
What're you saying?! Let me out!

100
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,680
How much hotter can it get?!

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,030
But if I keep going down these stairs,
I think I can get to where Ace is!

102
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,750
He headed down?!

103
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Is that true?! You're not
fooling with me, are you?!

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,260
--No!
--Certainly not!

105
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,850
Okay! Thank you for letting me out, Mr. 3!

106
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,480
I owe you!

107
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,770
--Ah?
--Alright then...

108
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm on my way, my friend!

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,400
Oh Come My Way! It's the way to hell!

110
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,390
This is the best for all of us.

111
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,200
Yeah, for sure...

112
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,210
How did he slip through our tight security?!

113
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,020
There's just one invader.

114
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,530
But if we let him rescue Ace,

115
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,430
not only Impel Down but the World
Government will be humiliated!

116
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,470
We're gonna get into that prison

117
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,480
and in the name of Navy Headquarters,
we must catch Straw Hat Luffy!

118
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,760
Wait a minute!

119
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,760
W-Who are you?!

120
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,780
I'm Sadie-chan who loves torturing people!

121
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,890
After being breached by an
intruder, taking Navy help

122
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,880
would only further
disgrace Impel Down's name!

123
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,630
She can't be serious using
"chan" to refer to herself...

124
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,840
Shut up!

125
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,890
You better call me "Sadie-chan!"

126
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,980
I can't resist those screams!

127
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
You bitch!

128
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,610
Hold it! Are you saying that
you don't need our help?

129
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,370
Yes. This prison is a labyrinthine hell.

130
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,830
If you don't know it well, you can't help us!

131
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,210
We'd appreciate your help if
you just guard the outside.

132
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,590
We'll raise this drawbridge which is
the only entrance to the prison...

133
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,930
...and seal off Impel Down completely!

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,100
Don't worry. There is no way out...

135
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,100
...of this underwater prison!

136
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,480
Alright then, we'll guard the outside.

137
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,400
You're a good boy.

138
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,020
A koala?

139
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,660
You're kidding me!

140
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,700
A koala.

141
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,750
A koala?

142
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,790
A koala.

143
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,850
We're completely sealed off!

144
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
A koala?

145
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,760
Hannyabal?!

146
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,670
Magellan's here, too. What's going on?

147
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
You have a special visitor, Ace!

148
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,480
Guess who's here!

149
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,980
Jimbei! Even you have never met her before,

150
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,440
so there's no way that
Ace can guess who it is.

151
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,610
She's well-known but never shows herself!
She leads the Kuja - the tribe of warriors!

152
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,300
She's a Warlord of the Sea!

153
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,670
Strong, noble, and the most
beautiful woman in the world!

154
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,960
She is the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!

155
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,930
Yeah, yeah, Hancock! Hancock-sama!

156
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,970
Yo, goddess! When I become
warden, will you marry me?!

157
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,610
Please!

158
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,030
Ouch! I really wanna become the warden!

159
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,120
I mean, it really hurts
to be hit by the warden!

160
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,440
What are you doing?!

161
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,490
Wow! Is she it?! She is so beautiful!

162
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,360
So she's the Snake Princess
of the Kuja? Hey, turn around!

163
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,480
Hancock-chan!

164
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,590
Look how sexy she is!

165
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,240
Young lady! Come to our cell!

166
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,330
We will love you tenderly!

167
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,600
What a good smell! I wanna
visit the Maiden Island!

168
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,550
There's only women and
everybody's naked there, right?

169
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,520
What do you want from me?

170
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,650
Nothing. I just wanted to take a look at you.

171
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,490
Because you will become the cause
of the war that I will take part in.

172
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,870
So I'm worth a look, then?

173
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,640
Boa Hancock! Are you ignoring us?!

174
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,480
Come here!

175
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,840
You've always been an empress with a strong
will who never obeyed any summonses,

176
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,350
but you're taking part in this war?

177
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,950
Suddenly, you value your
title of Warlord of the Sea?!

178
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,690
So you're Jimbei. Don't snarl at me.

179
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,420
Yo, yo, young lady! Young lady!

180
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,600
They're talking! Shut your mouths!

181
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,340
Shut up, Magellan! Go have a shit as always!

182
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,150
Yeah, he's right!

183
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,670
Hey, Snake Princess!

184
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,710
I bet the girls on the Maiden
Island are hungry for us guys!

185
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,910
Hey you! Give me your post as warden!

186
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,870
Vice Warden!

187
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,560
Hey girl! I said "get your
ass over to our cell!"

188
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,990
You guys!

189
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,620
She turned!

190
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,100
You keep taunting me with
those coarse voices...

191
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,140
I'm scared!

192
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,480
Oh, god! I can't resist!

193
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,000
How cute she is! Let us have her, Shit Man!

194
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,400
This is the vilest place in
the world! It makes me sick!

195
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,000
The prisoners call you "Shit Man."
How can you stand it, Warden?

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,370
They must've crushed any
pride you take in your job...

197
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,940
Wow! She's irresistible!

198
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,620
Shame on you, Shit Man!

199
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,830
However...

200
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,710
Let me have her, Shit Man!

201
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,640
Shit Man! Let me have Hancock!

202
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,050
I'm infuriated at their rudeness!

203
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,660
Wow! Warden, w-w-wait!

204
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,000
That's gonna harm us, too! No!

205
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,210
You've gotten carried away!

206
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,280
Ugh! Oh man!

207
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,570
I have to show you...

208
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,530
...who is boss in this prison!

209
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,550
Oh man!

210
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,260
His Hydra appears!

211
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,950
--What're you doing?!
--Stop, Magellan!

212
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,660
You fool! We were just joking! Don't!

213
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,060
You bastard! You can't do this to me!

214
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,940
Oh no! You're gonna die!

215
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,070
I need... I need an antidote! Shit!

216
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,250
I have the authority and the ability...

217
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,630
...to execute any of you at
my whim! Don't forget it!

218
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,560
All right, Hancock-dono.
You can talk freely now.

219
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,310
I'm done.

220
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,900
Hey! Is what you just told me true?!

221
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,480
Why would I lie to you?

222
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,110
Oh yeah!

223
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,610
He was worried that you might get mad.

224
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,790
Are you done already?

225
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,620
What were they talking about?

226
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,500
I dunno. I was trying really
hard to get away from you.

227
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,710
Ace-san.

228
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,170
What did she just tell you?

229
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,180
She said that my brother's here!

230
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,660
What?! The one with a straw hat
that you always talk about?!

231
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,140
That's insane!

232
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,860
Ah? I didn't notice but I'm
climbing now! I wanna go down!

233
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,740
But I guess If I keep going, it's
gonna go downwards at some point!

234
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm hungry!

235
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,910
We got an image! He's
about to enter district C!

236
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,740
Alright, I see him!

237
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,010
Sea Prism Stone nets, again!

238
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
That was close!

239
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,120
Oh no! The lion!

240
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,240
Damnit!

241
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,130
Wait a minute, you lion!

242
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,970
I'm here to help you!

243
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
Zoro!

244
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,900
I fooled you!

245
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,530
Swan Arabesque!

246
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,250
--Swan, swan!
--Oh?

247
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,780
Spin, spin! I'm spinning!

248
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,390
He's not Zoro but he sounds familiar...

249
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,310
It's been a long time!
Straw-chan, it's me!

250
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,820
So how was my secret talent?!

251
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,610
Cool!

252
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,530
Gimme a break!

253
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,120
--Running now wouldn't be like Bon Clay...
--Huh?!

254
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,960
If we abandon pals who would risk
their lives to pick up their pal,

255
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,870
will we... be able to
enjoy our food tomorrow?!

256
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,880
Miss Hina! The sheep ship
is heading to the east!

257
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,750
What?!

258
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,530
You were tricked, weren't you!

259
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,340
We’re experts at disguising
ourselves! And...

260
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,850
we’re the Straw Hats’ friends...!

261
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,230
Bring it on!

262
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:59,270
We'll never forget you!

263
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,070
Bon-chan!

264
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,990
I'm so disappointed that you're not
Zoro but at least you're alive!

265
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,330
It's our chance! Get Straw Hat!

266
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,740
Go away!

267
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,130
You assholes! What do you think
you're doing to my friend?!

268
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,630
Yeah, Sphinx! Fight back!

269
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,940
Okay! He's not gonna attack us
after getting busted up like this!

270
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,730
You gotta get rough to teach
a wild animal a lesson!

271
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,400
Fried noodle bun...

272
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,990
Hey, Bon-chan! I thought
that you were dead...

273
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,850
...after sacrificing yourself for us!

274
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,850
Gimme a break! Queers never die!

275
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,480
Oh, is that right?!

276
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,370
Let's see how Mr. 2 Bon Clay's power works!

277
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,050
He ate the Clone-Clone Fruit

278
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:18,020
and he can turn into anyone whose face
has been touched by his right hand.

279
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,810
He turned into Zoro because
he touched him before.

280
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,640
Here's another escapee!

281
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,370
He keeps gaining friends as
he descends deeper and deeper!

282
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,870
Blugoris! Don't let them get away!

283
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,720
By the way, Straw-chan, I heard
that you wanna get to level 5!

284
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,640
Yes, indeed! Can you show me the way?

285
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,320
Alright, I'll go with you!

286
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,800
Actually, there's someone
that I wanna see on level 5!

287
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,150
You sure?!

288
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,320
Okay then, let's do it together!

289
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,040
Uh-huh!

290
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,280
Let's go!

291
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,990
Yeah!

292
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,500
Luffy teams up with Mr. 2 Bon Clay again,

293
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,880
and they blast through level 3, taking
out armies of Blugoris along the way.

294
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
At last, they're close to level 4!

295
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,840
But before they get there, an
immensely powerful demon guard,

296
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,220
Minotaurus, stands before them.

297
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,270
"Warden Magellan's Strategy!
Straw Hat Entrapment Completed!"

299
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
