2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,720
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,130
Impact!

21
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,950
Sanji!

22
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,940
Life is suffering.

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,900
Now, for the other two!

24
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,470
'Kay, let's do this! Center of the ship!

25
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,470
I'll put it on the main mast,
so if anyone's in trouble,

26
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,120
they can get the whistle from here and blow it!

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,240
Now it's fair!

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,010
A-All right! Good thing this was here!

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,350
Huh? You're the only sacrifice I get to kill?

30
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,110
"Chopper in Danger!
Former God vs. Priest Shura"

31
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,130
What do you think? Don't they look amazing?

32
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,090
Huh?

33
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,060
This year's pumpkins are very good.

34
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,060
"Knight"

35
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,640
Yes...

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,520
I don't know what to say
to express my gratitude.

37
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,260
I'm sorry. Now I am staying with you, as well.

38
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,490
If they decide that your daughter
let those straw hat fellows escape,

39
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,960
they'll consider you an accomplice.
So you'll be in danger as well.

40
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,250
This time is on the house...

41
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,890
Eneru's Mantra does not reach this far.

42
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,130
How are things on Angel Island?

43
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,290
Yes?

44
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,340
I'm referring to crops.
How are this year's crops coming?

45
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,420
Yes, I hear they're coming along quite well.

46
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,950
Is that right? I'm glad to hear that.

47
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,780
This is juice made from the
pumpkins that I grew in my field.

48
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,940
It tastes good.

49
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,620
Yes. I'm sorry. Thank you.

50
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,450
Conis-san, have some, too.

51
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,050
Young lady, are you aware that there are
those called pirates in the Blue Sea?

52
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,550
No.

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,260
They are criminals who travel on the blue sea.

54
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:03,230
Their ships all fly a black flag with a skull on it,
although each pirate's flag is different.

55
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,690
Those straw hat fellows
are probably pirates, too.

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,700
My word! Are you saying that
they were already criminals?!

57
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,330
Well... It is probably true that they
do not live by the rules of the Blue Sea.

58
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,330
In any society, there are always
those who don't blend in.

59
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,660
Right now, how are you any different?

60
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,230
Who can say for certain that society is right
and that those who don't blend in are wrong?

61
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,000
Sometimes it's not so clear-cut.

62
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,110
To put it in extreme terms, a "hero" in wartime

63
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,900
is simply a killer if he lives in a different time.

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,190
I also have a pirate friend.

65
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,000
He came here when I was still
God over twenty years ago.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,770
He was quite the big-hearted
and pleasant fellow.

67
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,110
I hated to say goodbye.

68
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,810
Right now, though it doesn't
look it at first glance,

69
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,700
Skypiea is a land of endless battles.

70
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,290
A land where battles between
those of us from the sky

71
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,090
and Shandians, also known as
guerrillas, rage continuously.

72
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,560
The Shandians are still challenging Eneru.

73
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,320
Your attempt to coexist with the
Shandians when you were God

74
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,850
offered hope that the several-hundred-year war

75
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,020
would end in peace.

76
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,990
Yes... I was very close to succeeding,

77
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,850
but my status as God was taken away by Eneru.

78
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,990
I'm sorry. Everything went
down the drain because of that.

79
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,180
Wh-What're you saying?!
There's no need to apologize.

80
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,850
In Skypiea, there is this legend
passed down from long ago.

81
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,410
Long ago, on the day that Upper Yard,
the sacred ground, was born,

82
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,100
the island's beautiful singing
voice enveloped Skypiea.

83
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,180
That's when the battle between the
Shandians and those from the sky began...

84
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,330
...as if that voice was a cue.

85
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,620
So, when we hear the "island's singing voice,"

86
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,250
the legend says that this battle will end.

87
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,990
The island's singing voice?

88
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,220
That's right.

89
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,670
The sacred ground will sing again...

90
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,170
...someday, for sure.

91
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,560
What's the matter?

92
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,130
Please look after this place. I've got a job.

93
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,550
Let's go, Pierre!

94
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,050
Father, what tasty pumpkin juice this is!

95
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,090
Yes... I'm really glad...

96
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,500
...that you can enjoy it.

97
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,110
"God"

98
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,080
Now, offer your life to God Eneru!

99
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,950
Fire...!

100
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,310
Why do you struggle?

101
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,980
There's no way that you can escape death!

102
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,130
Die gracefully!

103
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,670
What?!

104
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,770
The ship is...!

105
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,310
Hmph! So he's gonna get big...

106
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,660
Darn it! Come on!

107
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,220
Hey, hey! Why do you care when there
won't be anyone to get on board?!

108
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,550
You and your friends cannot escape death.

109
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,150
Who the hell are you?!
Stop it! Don't harm them!

110
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,720
Then... offer your life instead!

111
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,050
No!

112
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,210
Stop it! Stop it!

113
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,110
Don't harm the ship! Just don't harm the ship!

114
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,090
Dammit!

115
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,650
You bastard!

116
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,720
You bastard! Stop it already!

117
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,910
I-I'm in charge of this ship!

118
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,600
They asked me to look after it.

119
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,730
Well, what should we do, Fuza?

120
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,980
"Thirty-foot Bird
Fuza"

121
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,500
He says not to harm his friends.

122
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,190
He says not to damage the ship.

123
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,110
He says he doesn't want to die.

124
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,450
What a dilemma.

125
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:19,780
"Skypiea Priest
Sky Rider Shura"

126
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,680
Such a damned selfish animal!

127
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,760
He really irks me!

128
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,130
Gan Fall...

129
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,100
Hey, Nami! Get a move on!

130
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,830
Shut up! Don't talk to me right now!

131
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,610
What'll you do if I fall?!

132
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,890
Hey! Are you all right?!

133
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,740
Yeah...

134
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,090
...somehow...

135
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,850
My apologies... for troubling you so often.

136
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,760
No problem.

137
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,330
What's wrong? Did you see God or something?

138
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,020
No... a well.

139
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,860
A well?

140
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,290
The ship... your friends... and yourself...

141
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,090
You don't want to lose any of those?

142
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,720
If you want to live so much,
then why are you so weak?!

143
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,510
Stop it! That spear burns things!

144
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,070
Stop it!

145
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,800
Dammit!

146
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,190
You creep!

147
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,790
Wha...?!

148
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,580
Are you trying to live...
without sacrificing anything?

149
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,510
What is this guy?

150
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,050
It's as if he can predict my moves.

151
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,640
For someone to live, another must die.

152
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,150
That's how life is.

153
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,080
Did you know that this is a sacrificial altar?

154
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,610
Y-Yeah! I heard something like that.

155
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:45,110
It's true. The rest of your group
is desperately trying to get here.

156
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,250
There are four separate areas
that we, the priests, govern.

157
00:15:50,170 --> 00:16:01,870
"Swamp" "Iron" "String" "Ball"

158
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,010
The rule is that when the
targets are in one area,

159
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,770
the other priests aren't supposed
to do anything to the targets.

160
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:05,770
But this sacrificial altar doesn't
belong to any of those areas.

161
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,400
"Swamp" "Iron" "String" "Ball"
"Sacrificial Altar"

162
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,840
In other words, it's a free area.

163
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,510
So it doesn't matter who
strikes the ones at the altar.

164
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,970
But it should be after those who're
receiving the ordeal in some area die.

165
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,780
What?! Then, Luffy and the others are...?!

166
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:31,770
Don't freak out. My coming here doesn't
mean your friends' death... unfortunately...

167
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,040
I came here for a different reason.

168
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,210
What?! A different reason...?

169
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,730
Ah, but does that mean we can also
get out of here if Luffy and the others

170
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,600
come to rescue us?!

171
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,150
Yeah, that's right...

172
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,690
...if you can get out of this free area.

173
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,500
What...?

174
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,570
But, hold that thought.

175
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:01,620
The reason I came here is because,
although those are the normal judgment rules,

176
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,070
when there's an exceptional
situation, the rules change a little.

177
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,230
Exceptional...

178
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,750
Yes. For example, when three of the sacrifices

179
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,260
escaped to the forest over there
without permission using vines...

180
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,660
I see... that's an exceptio...

181
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,480
God's on this island, right?
I'm gonna go meet him.

182
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,360
He's the culprit!

183
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,820
What's with her, wandering off on her own?

184
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,690
What a selfish woman!

185
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,300
I don't think I could take
being called selfish by you.

186
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,280
Huh?!

187
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,010
Because of you, I feel that I've gone through
so many hardships that I wouldn't have had to.

188
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,740
Err... really?

189
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,530
Someone has to die to atone
for the others' crime of escaping.

190
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,900
Sacrifice is a fact of life.

191
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,220
Especially if they are to come back,

192
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,740
in order that they can more
deeply realize their own fault

193
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,000
when they see their friend's death...

194
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,350
...offer your life... to God!!

195
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,620
No!!

196
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,880
Die!

197
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,760
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

198
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,550
Sky Knight!!

199
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,350
Hmph! Looks like a surprise guest showed up!

200
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,050
Gan Fall!!

201
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,460
Sky Knight!!

202
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
He is quite good. He is a worthy opponent.

203
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,240
Let's get rough with him, Pierre.

204
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,640
What's that old previous God doing here?!

205
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,650
Shall we play with him a little, Fuza?!

206
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,890
Just keep barking!

207
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,070
We don't need two Gods on this island!

208
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,410
Go!!

209
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,020
Sky... Knight...!!

210
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,400
We need to give him one
more push, Pierre. Let's go!

211
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,530
You son of a bitch!

212
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,890
You probably came here knowing this, but...

213
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,290
...you're already a criminal!

214
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:16,120
Ahh, I'll show you what I do
to aggravating fools like you!!

215
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,710
String Ordeal!

216
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,860
You're still alive?

217
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,230
Impressive indeed!

218
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,260
Well, then, as a reward, I'll give
you my prized finishing blow!

219
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,710
Surprise Balls! Ball Dragon!!

220
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Even if we're far apart

221
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,740
I don't want you to forget

222
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:38,420
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

223
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,000
You have a friend here to share the pain

224
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:52,600
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

225
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,100
I won't let it just be a dream

226
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,820
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

227
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:13,580
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

228
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,070
Whoa! What a fight!

229
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,280
You bastard! What did you do?! I can't move!

230
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
Sky Knight!

231
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,690
Ah! What's this?!

232
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,900
I've finally caught him!
Sanji, give him a good pounding!

233
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,740
On the next episode of One Piece!

234
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,800
"Profound Mystery!
Ordeal of String and Ordeal of Love?!"

235
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
