2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

51
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,310
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

52
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,900
who has been captured by the Navy.

53
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,170
Buggy and Mr. 3 who were
trying to get to level 3...

54
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,590
...have been captured by
Vice Warden Hannyabal, but...

55
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,680
Meanwhile, Luffy's battle
against Warden Magellan is...

56
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,180
This is your punishment.

57
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,760
There is no way to neutralize the
amount of poison you have absorbed!

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
You will agonize for 24 hours

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
and then pass...

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,070
...to the real hell!

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,810
"For his friend!
Bon Clay Goes to the Deadly Rescue!"

62
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,930
Warden Magellan! Great fight!

63
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,620
What should we do with the fallen Luffy?

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,560
He'll die soon but we don't
want him lying there.

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,880
Throw him into the Central Tower on level 5.

66
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,040
Yes, sir!

67
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,190
W-Warden Magellan!

68
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,780
We had a problem at the staircase to level 3!

69
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,100
That's Hannyabal's post! What happened?

70
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,650
I don't know the details!

71
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,160
Hey. Hey!

72
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,120
He's gone.

73
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,430
He's either dead or preserved for the future.

74
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,130
That's ridiculous!

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,530
My f-fingers!

76
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,310
I can't move them! I can't even feel them!

77
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,630
That's frostbite! You're history!

78
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,090
Damn, this is aggravating!

79
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,930
I can't even bite this bread!

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,780
Hey, look! Here's a newcomer!

81
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,150
Hey! What's your name?!

82
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,150
How much is your bounty?! Talk to us!

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,340
He's nearly dead!

84
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,170
He already got the poison punishment!

85
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,050
What's the meaning of all this?!

86
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,400
Hannyabal! I counted on you but all
of your guards have been beaten!

87
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,700
Wake up, Hannyabal! What happened here?!

88
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,280
W-Warden! Please let go of me!

89
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,330
I-I am very sorry! I was off-guard!

90
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,850
I-I don't want gomon (torture)!

91
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,680
Komon (anus) stinks!

92
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,560
Damn that queer! He abandoned us!

93
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,020
A queer who uses martial arts did all this!

94
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,550
How can I put this...
He caught us by surprise!

95
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,170
No excuse!

96
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,190
You let him get away and
he escaped to the upper levels, right?

97
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,290
That prisoner used to work for
Crocodile's Baroque Works.

98
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,140
He's the guy who used to call himself Mr. 2.

99
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,550
I mean, that queer!

100
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,970
That doesn't matter!

101
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,330
He was captured in level 3.

102
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,270
I'm sure that we'll catch him in time.

103
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,800
What happened to the riot on level 2?!

104
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,390
It's almost under control.

105
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,400
I want all guards gathered
on level 4 to go to level 3!

106
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,760
Unleash all demon guards
under Sadie-chan's command!

107
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,710
I'll leave the rest to you!

108
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,010
Okay! What about these two?

109
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,410
Do whatever you like!

110
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,050
Clean up all the mess now
and get things in order!

111
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,720
I'm going to head to my "private place."

112
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,320
Ouch!

113
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,120
"The runs"... as usual?

114
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,680
Hey you guys, get up and
look for the last escapee!

115
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,460
Yes, in a second!

116
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,290
E-Excuse me!

117
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,700
What do you wanna do with these two?

118
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,150
Oh! I want to ask them about something.

119
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,760
Get us an interview room.

120
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,090
I'll take charge of them.

121
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,490
Understood, sir.

122
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,730
Alright then, Vice Warden!

123
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,450
Yeah.

124
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,420
Now, what we'll do is...

125
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,390
We're safe now!

126
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,790
W-We escaped torture!

127
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,330
Okay, what should we do now?

128
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,040
You know what we're gonna do!

129
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,730
We better hurry and...

130
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,510
...rescue Straw-chan!

131
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,860
R-Rescue him?!

132
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,840
Did you hear them saying

133
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,340
that he's been poisoned
by Magellan and is on level 5?!

134
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,840
There's no hope for him to survive

135
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,050
and we'd die like dogs!

136
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,110
He's right! Why should we even try?!

137
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,790
I don't care if we die like dogs--or queers!

138
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,600
When I turned my back on
Straw-chan and Magellan,

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
I had already died!

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,980
I thought that I better run
than suffer the same fate.

141
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,500
And if there's a chance he'll survive,

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,490
then I'll be back to put my life
on the line and rescue him!

143
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,170
That's what I swore!

144
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,350
And I ran!

145
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,160
That's a very nice story,
but now you're free!

146
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,050
Why would you wanna go back
and risk your life again?!

147
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,020
Because I'm his friend!

148
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,060
I don't need any other reasons!

149
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,990
Friends?

150
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,810
We gotta deal with the poison
to save Straw-chan!

151
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,070
We need an antidote!

152
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,260
You think that we can get it?

153
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,750
It's too late anyway!

154
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,090
Shut up!

155
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,780
I must... I must do this!

156
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,280
Wait for me!

157
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,450
Don't die on me yet, Straw-chan!

158
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,960
No way?!

159
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,680
I mean, what do you mean that
you can't make an antidote!

160
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,110
No one ever survives after...

161
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,740
...challenging Warden Magellan and
receiving a heavy dose of his poison!

162
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,800
If it's just one kind, maybe we could
but we can't make an antidote...

163
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,010
...that works for various poisons!

164
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,230
And you people call yourselves
a medical team?!

165
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,650
Gimme a break!

166
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,490
Huh?

167
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,470
I mean... give me a break and do something!

168
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,700
We have to turn Straw Hat Luffy
over to the Navy!

169
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,710
But if we administer the medication
incorrectly, he'll die sooner!

170
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,260
I'm sorry to say this but
there's no way to keep him alive.

171
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,920
I told you! It's too late to save Straw Hat!

172
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,790
There is no antidote.

173
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,390
That means we can't do anything for him!

174
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,430
Now, give up on Straw Hat

175
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,780
and let's get out of this prison together!

176
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,230
He's right!

177
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,510
You need to know when to give up!

178
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,110
If we stay here any longer, we'll melt away!

179
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,370
To be honest with you,
no matter how hard you try,

180
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,040
Straw Hat is maybe already...

181
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,880
It was reckless to fight against
Magellan in the first place.

182
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,460
You can't survive a battle with him.

183
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,760
It'd take a miracle!

184
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,890
A miracle?

185
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,980
Oh yeah! He is in Impel Down!

186
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,050
The queen of queers--

187
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,920
Ivan-san!

188
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,130
He once saved both a patient
who was given up on by his doctor,

189
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,310
and a half-broken country!

190
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,500
There are a lot of legends about him!

191
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,170
He's the greatest star of all queers--Ivan-san!

192
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,030
We better find him now!

193
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,500
Who's... Ivan-san?

194
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,520
LEVEL 4--STAFF STAIRCASE

195
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,630
You wanna go to level 5?

196
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,920
Yes, I do.

197
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,260
These two have been
sentenced to freeze to death!

198
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,570
Why are we going to level 5?

199
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,970
We have no choice.

200
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,020
We can try to escape
but the security on level 3

201
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,000
must be tightened by Magellan's order.

202
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:38,110
We're safe for now as long as
we stay with the "Vice Warden."

203
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,220
I know that!

204
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,620
But his obsession with saving Straw Hat -

205
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,210
I don't know how long we're gonna be safe!

206
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,010
Yeah, but at least we are for now!

207
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,560
Keep walking!

208
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,800
I got to do this!

209
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,650
Wait for me, Straw-chan!

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,250
But this list of prisoners is confusing.

211
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,230
What is this about?

212
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,960
Emporio Ivancov--the real name
of Ivan-san has been crossed off!

213
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,910
Has he been released already?
Or has he been executed?!

214
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,260
Did we let this prisoner go free?

215
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,660
What?! Oh, Ivancov...

216
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,340
You-know-what happened
to him a few years ago...

217
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,930
You-know-what?

218
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,670
Don't you remember it, Vice Warden?

219
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,250
Oh!

220
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,370
Oh yeah! That! Yeah!

221
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,260
Do you know about That?! Explain it to me!

222
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,680
But there are prisoners here.

223
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,010
I don't care!

224
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,420
People have disappeared
occasionally in Impel Down.

225
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,000
They didn't break out because
some of them could barely move.

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,360
They just disappeared without a trace.

227
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,780
We call it "Demoning away!"

228
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,780
We all fear these unnatural
disappearances and assume...

229
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,340
...that they're pulled into the gate of hell.

230
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,470
That's why we call it "Demoning away!"

231
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,390
People disappear...?

232
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,820
I wish that I hadn't heard that.

233
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,420
Me, too.

234
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,310
Wow, it's cold already!
The door isn't even open yet!

235
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,140
And we're wearing heavy clothes!

236
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,350
We're here!

237
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,060
Be careful of the severe coldness
and Army Wolves!

238
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,790
Now, I'll take them as usual.

239
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,730
Huh? You take what?

240
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,310
Well, your weapons and coat.

241
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,480
What?!

242
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,220
We really can't imagine how you can do it!

243
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,860
How you always say

244
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,750
"I'll show the prisoners
the dignity of the Vice Warden!"

245
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,260
and go into the Freezing Hell
naked without any weapons.

246
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,800
We all admire you for doing so!

247
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,360
What?!

248
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,420
It's not appropriate to let prisoners wear coats

249
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,140
so we'll take them, naturally!

250
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,900
They'll take our coats, too!

251
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,110
What?!

252
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,240
Be careful!

253
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,260
Due to the temperature,
Transponder Snails don't work here!

254
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,720
Take care!

255
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,000
What?!

256
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,640
It's so... ugh!

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,310
U-Unlock my handcuffs now!

258
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,850
I-I can barely use my hand in this coldness!

259
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,760
It's too cold! The air hurts!

260
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,390
I-I almost got it!

261
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,580
It's unlocked!

262
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,280
Yes! You did it!

263
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,580
1, 2, 3... there're 4 of them!

264
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,930
Hey, don't tell me that they're Army Wolves!

265
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,520
Do you know why they're here instead
of the Floor of Wild Beasts from Hell?!

266
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,760
No. Why?

267
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,150
Oh, I know!

268
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,860
Because they would eat the
other beasts like the Basilisk or Sphinx!

269
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,180
Are you kidding me?!

270
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,550
So they're extra special savage!

271
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,360
Severe cold was enough
but now we got Army Wolves, too!

272
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,130
Another reason for my teeth to chatter!

273
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,030
Alright, let's just do this!

274
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,950
We're gonna rescue Straw-chan!

275
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,380
I don't wanna become their dinner!

276
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,590
You're running already?!

277
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,550
S-So strong!

278
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,360
Now I know why they're
demon guards on level 5!

279
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,220
But I can't die here like a dog or a queer!

280
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,520
I gotta save Straw-chan!

281
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,460
I'll show them my queer guts!

282
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,480
"Oh Come My Way" Kenpo...

283
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,200
Ha!

284
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,880
I-I can't move my body!

285
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,910
I told you!

286
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,610
It's not good for us to stay with that guy!

287
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,770
The situation is far worse than I expected!

288
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,070
We gotta find a way out, quick!

289
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,320
If we fool around here any longer,
The Army Wolves will find us!

290
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,740
The Burning Heat Hell to the Freezing Hell!

291
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,430
What a difference!

292
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,270
But this coldness is unusual...

293
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,910
Hey, don't stop running!

294
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,400
But I can feel that instead of
keeping myself warm by running,

295
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,790
it's drawing all my energy!

296
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,420
How cold can it get?!

297
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,260
Yeah!

298
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,990
Oh, I think that we can
avoid the wind over there!

299
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,260
W-W-Wait!

300
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,110
D-Dammit!

301
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,780
The wind isn't blowing here but
the floor froze my butt and my entire body!

302
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,620
If we stay here,
both of us will be frozen for real!

303
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,210
Alright, let's do it!

304
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,320
You got a plan?!

305
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,270
Do you remember that we formed
an alliance to breakout?!

306
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, we huddled and decided to join forces...

307
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,000
We should huddle together now!

308
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,370
Good idea!

309
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,720
Alright, let's snuggle up and get warm!

310
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,590
Rub, rub, rub...

311
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,210
Rub, rub, rub...

312
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,110
Rub, rub, rub...

313
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Hmm...

314
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,540
I'm not getting warm at all and...

315
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,430
Um. I feel kinda sick!

316
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,320
I feel sick, too!

317
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,250
They followed us!

318
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,030
They followed us!

319
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,500
They followed us!

320
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,550
They followed us!

321
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,380
And there's more now!

322
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,260
He tastes better than me! I guarantee!

323
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,400
What're you saying?!

324
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,670
I'm a wax man so I taste awful!

325
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,510
--He tastes better than me!
--He tastes better than me!

326
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,450
What a mess this is.

327
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,080
Do we have to see him dying?

328
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,420
Ouch!

329
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,210
I wanna go and rescue Ace!

330
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,340
You'll be like an ant blown into a storm.

331
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,240
You can just be flicked away
without even having done anything.

332
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,090
A... Ace!

333
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,260
Stop resisting!

334
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,550
You can't survive after
taking that much poison!

335
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,160
You've lost your sight, huh?

336
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,980
Can you hear me?

337
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,200
Be quiet and accept death!

338
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,600
No! I don't wanna die!

339
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,430
I'm not gonna die until I rescue Ace!

340
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,420
Do you wanna rescue somebody?

341
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,610
Even you have no hope for yourself?

342
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,410
Is it your friend?

343
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,640
How stupid!

344
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,290
You gotta save your own ass in a prison!

345
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,450
No one's gonna come to save you!

346
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,540
We're all alone!

347
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,020
In the sea of fire,

348
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,490
you'd step on someone
beside you in order to survive!

349
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,450
When you face the beasts,

350
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,190
you'd sacrifice someone near you to survive!

351
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,090
You'll die if you care about others!

352
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,930
So, cut the you-wanna-rescue-someone crap!

353
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,120
It makes me sick!

354
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,170
Look! Somebody's coming!

355
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,840
He's not a jailer or one of the staff!

356
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,640
What's wrong with him?

357
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,840
Is he naked!

358
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,910
Straw-chan, I come to rescue you!

359
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,580
In the name of friendship!

360
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,080
Bon Clay searches level 5 for the queen of queers--Iva-san.

361
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,450
However, under repeated attacks
from the Army Wolves and

362
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,380
fighting to withstand the
cold of the Freezing Hell,

363
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,890
he loses his strength and collapses.

364
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,390
Where is this queen of queers, exactly?

365
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,110
On the next episode of One Piece!

366
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,910
"A Paradise in Hell!
Impel Down Level 5.5!"

367
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,260
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
