2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,550
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,610
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,770
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,390
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,910
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,520
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,580
Foolish pirates.

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,630
You'd knowingly attack
the invincible fleet

26
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,880
commanded by Captain
Usopp-sama of the Going Merry?!

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,960
Attack them, men! Attack!

28
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,510
C'mon, you guys.
Show some interest in other people...

29
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,070
All done!

30
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,520
Look! A pirate flag!

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,620
Now that Usopp's joined
and we have four people,

32
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,660
we need to have our own mark!

33
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,610
That's our mark?

34
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,580
Whadya think? Nice, huh?!

35
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,620
A pirate flag is a symbol of death.
A symbol of fear!

36
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,430
I do sense fear, though...
Fear of your talent.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,060
Wish you would've told me first!

38
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Don't forget about me,
the gifted artist!

39
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,380
Gifted artist?

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,580
I've drawn graffiti on walls
for 50 years straight!

41
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,150
When it comes to painting,
I'm in a league all my own!

42
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,420
Awesome! 50 years?!

43
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,890
That means he's an old man now!

44
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,530
Not only that, he must have
5 or 6 grandkids by now!

45
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,200
That's awesome, too!

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,070
Hey!

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,080
Alright! Behold this work of art!

48
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,570
Tadah!

49
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,990
Who told you to make your flag?!

50
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,280
I guess that's more like it.

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,320
Wow, it's pretty good!

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,300
Yeah! It's good! I like it!

53
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,690
So this is our mark...

54
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,820
Alright! Usopp!
Draw one on the sail, too!

55
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,760
Right!

56
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,700
Alright! All done!

57
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,450
Now the Going Merry
pirate ship is all set!

58
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,560
"You're the Weird Creature!
Gaimon and His Strange Friends"

59
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,630
I'm pooped...

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,670
Is this the right way?
It seems kinda dangerous...

61
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,660
What?!

62
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,640
Wait.

63
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,620
That's it! That's the place!
No doubt about it!

64
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,360
Do you see something neat?

65
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,030
The legendary Treasure Island.

66
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,350
The legendary Treasure Island?
I've heard of that before!

67
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah! It's a famous
island among pirates!

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,820
As are the weird stories about it...

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,780
Weird stories?

70
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,880
That whoever gets near the
island incurs a god's wrath...

71
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,600
W-Were the rumors really true?!
Is this the god's wrath?!

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
That sounds kinda neat!

73
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,100
Luffy! You're not thinking of--

74
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,480
We sure are!

75
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,040
Let's go! Treasure Island!

76
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,390
This is one creepy island!

77
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,550
Yeah?

78
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,820
It's said that an extraordinary treasure
rests somewhere on this island.

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,070
Supposedly, lots of pirates
have landed here in the past,

80
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,620
but they've all fled in terror
before they could even look for it.

81
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,120
In terror?

82
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,880
Supposedly, one pirate's face
suddenly changed into a boar's face,

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,420
and another's mustache stretched
out and strangled him like snakes.

84
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,460
That's not real, right?

85
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,430
Though I'm sure the stories
are exaggerated somewhat!

86
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,660
D-Don't scare me like that!

87
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,490
I'm hungry.

88
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm going to sleep.

89
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,550
How can he sleep in
a creepy place like this?

90
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,820
Yeah. What kind of
nerves does he have?

91
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,300
What are you doing?! Don't scare me!

92
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,410
N-No, I just thought I'd do
a little dance to liven things up!

93
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,970
See? See? See?

94
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,590
Stop that, Luffy...

95
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,880
W-What is this?!

96
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,880
Leave...

97
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,200
Who's there?!

98
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,250
Leave!

99
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,470
Where's it coming from?!

100
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,920
I am this island's protective god!

101
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,220
Leave this island at once
if you value your lives!

102
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,710
Protective god?

103
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,180
You guys're pirates, aren't you?

104
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,080
Yeah.

105
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,800
Pirates, just as I thought.

106
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,930
Why would a god ask
something like that?

107
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,720
Listen! Just try taking
another step into the forest!

108
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,120
The instant you do, will you
receive my divine punishment

109
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,030
and meet your doom?!

110
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,490
How should I know?
Why are you asking me?

111
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,910
What's the deal?

112
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,350
This guy seems kinda weird.

113
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,800
What did you say, straw hat boy?!

114
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,530
W-What are these things?!

115
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,040
Humans I completely transformed
when they came to look for treasure.

116
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,130
Then you really are a god?!

117
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,760
Look at all these weird things...

118
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,680
Is this a lion?

119
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,180
Are you sure it's not a pig?

120
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,760
Oww! Oww! Oww!

121
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,080
W-What exactly are you?!

122
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,110
I'm a rubber person!
I ate a Devil Fruit!

123
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,900
Devil Fruit?! Don't be absurd!

124
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,450
I heard rumors about them long ago
when I used to be a pirate, but...

125
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,170
When you used to be a pirate?

126
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,610
N-No! I'm not reminiscing
about old times at all!

127
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,440
No, I don't want to
hear about old times!

128
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,110
What're you talking about?
You're the one who said it!

129
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,290
Are you really a god?!

130
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,050
Shut up! If you won't leave,
then receive my divine punishment!

131
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,730
Now you've done it, God!

132
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,540
H-How are you all right?!

133
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,220
--There you are!
--Don't move!

134
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,650
I told you not to move!

135
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,240
That can't be!

136
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,010
Hey, God or whoever!

137
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,230
Pistols don't work on this guy!

138
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,190
But they surprise me,
so I don't like 'em!

139
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,960
M-Monster!

140
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,280
O-Over there!

141
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,090
Here it is. His pistol.

142
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,260
Where'd he go?

143
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,520
What is this?

144
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
This is a god?

145
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,350
It's moving!

146
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,100
Stand me up, already!
I said stand me up!

147
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,370
He's a person!

148
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,440
Neat! Is he a scrub brush?

149
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,540
What's so god-like about you?!
You thought you could trick us!

150
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,080
Shut up! Stand me up, I say!

151
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,920
Don't act all big after
you've fallen over!

152
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
I-I'll let you go for today!

153
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,380
Wait!

154
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,010
Huh?!

155
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,730
Huh?!

156
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,810
--Hey! Luffy!
--Luffy!

157
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,970
There. You're all set.

158
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,140
You're a pretty popular guy, God...

159
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
So you used these guys

160
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,480
to scare off everyone
who came to the island?

161
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,070
But I've never seen a person stuffed
inside a treasure chest before!

162
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,280
Are you a boxed and sheltered son?

163
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,740
Yeah. I've been overly pampered
since I was just a little boy...

164
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,450
Of course I'm not!

165
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,060
I can't get out of this box!

166
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,120
I've been alone on this island
and in this box for 20 years now!

167
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,840
20 years?!

168
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,680
You've been all alone on
this island for 20 years?

169
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,770
My hair and mustache
are just as you can see.

170
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,650
Even my eyebrows got connected...

171
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,310
It's also been 20 years since I've
conversed with anyone like this.

172
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,930
Can you understand how painful this is?

173
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,080
It seems ridiculous.

174
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,250
What did you say?!

175
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,910
Oh, here you are...

176
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,240
You were asleep this whole time,
even after all that happened?!

177
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,000
W-Who's this guy?!

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Notice sooner.

179
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
He's a guy stuffed in a treasure chest!

180
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,970
Are you a boxed and sheltered son?!

181
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,430
Yeah. I've been overly pampered
since I was just a little boy...

182
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,810
Of course I'm not!

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,990
Don't do the same stupid gag twice!

184
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,380
Zoro! Gimme a hand!

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,770
Ouch! Ouch!

186
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,730
What are you doing?! Stop it!

187
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,370
You're pulling my head off!

188
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,940
You're right! You can't get out!

189
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,160
Don't be crazy!

190
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,780
Because of my lack of
exercise over the years,

191
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,620
this treasure chest fits
together with my body now!

192
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,560
If you try to break it,
my body'll get destroyed, too!

193
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,380
He's a strangely annoying guy.

194
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,370
But who are you guys?

195
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,880
You're nothing like any of the
other pirates who've come here.

196
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,010
I'm Luffy! The man who's
gonna be King of the Pirates!

197
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,430
W-What?!

198
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,890
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates
and get the One Piece!

199
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,800
The One Piece?!

200
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,320
Don't tell me you're seriously
planning to enter the Grand Line?!

201
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,940
We even have a chart of the Grand Line!

202
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,230
Don't take it lightly!
That place is Hell, or a graveyard!

203
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,880
I once saw pirates who'd managed
to escape from the Grand Line!

204
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,610
They looked almost like people
who had died and lost their souls!

205
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,000
Something incredibly
horrific must've happened,

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,960
or they must've run into
monsters or something...

207
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,890
Not a single one of them
even tried to speak.

208
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,340
On top of that, rumors about the
One Piece spawn even more rumors,

209
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,680
so there's no telling what's true or not!

210
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,290
Some 20-odd years since the
start of the Great Pirate Era,

211
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,640
the One Piece is already a dream
within a dream beyond a legend!

212
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,260
So which is the Grand Line?

213
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,940
Dunno. Don't you know,
old scrub brush guy?

214
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,130
I can't read sea charts one bit.

215
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,910
Oh. Then we're the same.

216
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,740
That's not a pirate conversation!

217
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,040
Anyways, even if we do
enter the Grand Line,

218
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,670
earning as much money as we can,
then escaping, is the best idea.

219
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,630
I will find the One Piece!
I have good luck!

220
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,420
Where does all that
confidence of yours come from?

221
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,380
I will get it! You'll see!

222
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,010
Whatever you say...

223
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,340
You're the same...

224
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,100
You're just like me;

225
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,220
you even look like me,
like we're twins!

226
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,400
How in the world
does he look like you?!

227
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,330
I understand! Achieving
your dreams someday!

228
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,650
We used to think the same way!

229
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,450
We?

230
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,950
We were willing to put our lives
on the line to search for treasure!

231
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,660
It was that zeal that
changed my entire life!

232
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,320
W-Wait. What do you mean?

233
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,850
It was 20 years ago.

234
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,490
My fellow pirates and I
landed on this island.

235
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,380
To find the treasure that
was said to rest here.

236
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,050
200 men have searched for
a month now, but it's no use!

237
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,690
All we've found on this island
is this one empty treasure chest!

238
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,830
We're leaving, men!

239
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,650
What're you doing, Gaimon?
We're going on ahead!

240
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,880
Yeah.

241
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,520
Did anyone look up there?

242
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,480
The captain stayed down
here the whole month...

243
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,370
I'll check it out one last time!

244
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,380
I couldn't believe my own eyes!

245
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,510
I-I found it! It's up here!

246
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,310
Hey! Guys!

247
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,350
That's when I got stuck in the chest!

248
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,430
When I came to, my crew
was already far out to sea.

249
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,370
Crap!

250
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,010
Wait a minute!

251
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,380
Does that mean that
fortune is all mine?!

252
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,940
I can't climb up like this!

253
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,130
I can't get out! I can't get out!

254
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,590
Hey! Come back!

255
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,580
Even after all this time,

256
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,770
the fortune I only saw for an
instant has never left my mind.

257
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,590
Pirates have come to this island
in search of treasure countless times,

258
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,440
but I used these guys
to scare them all away.

259
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,780
That's how I've protected
the treasure for 20 years now!

260
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,120
It's mine!

261
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,320
Yeah! No question about it! It's yours!

262
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,830
Alright, Gaimon-san!
We'll get the treasure for you!

263
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,760
--R-Really?!
--Yeah!

264
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,540
Don't tell me you're gonna...

265
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,420
Aren't you a thief who
only steals from pirates?

266
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,000
How rude!

267
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,960
Even I know what's
appropriate and what's not!

268
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,250
Here?

269
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,200
I haven't been here for a while, myself.

270
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,640
The time has finally come!
Today is a great day!

271
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,150
I'm counting on you, Straw Hat!

272
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,170
Alright! Gum-Gum...

273
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,750
...Rocket!

274
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,390
Yes!

275
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,400
W-Well?! Is it there?!

276
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,340
What's he doing?

277
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,030
Luffy!

278
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,540
Hey! Luffy!

279
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,660
What the heck's going on?!

280
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,000
I found 'em! Six treasure chests!

281
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,770
W-Well done!

282
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,430
I finally got it!
The treasure! The treasure!

283
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,460
Toss my treasure down here!

284
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,550
--Hurry! Hurry!
--No.

285
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,720
What?!

286
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,940
No! I don't wanna toss it down!

287
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,260
What nonsense is this?!
Quit joking around!

288
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,900
Yeah! That treasure belongs
to Gaimon-san! Toss it all down!

289
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,370
Quit clowning around, you!

290
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,560
It's all right.

291
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,090
It doesn't matter anymore.

292
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,260
Of course it does!

293
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,330
Yeah! You've guarded that
treasure for 20 years, Gaimon-san!

294
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,330
Straw Hat. You're...

295
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,300
...a great guy!

296
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,510
What do you mean?

297
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,080
I had a slight inkling
that might be the case...

298
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,640
I tried to avoid
thinking about it, but...

299
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,270
They're empty, aren't they?

300
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,310
Yeah. They're all empty.

301
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,610
That's terrible...

302
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,970
The treasure he guarded for 20 years

303
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,870
was just empty boxes...

304
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,610
It happens all the time with
treasures that have treasure maps...

305
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,080
You go to look, but
someone's already stolen it.

306
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,840
That's how much of an ordeal
treasure-hunting is for pirates.

307
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,680
You can wait all your life, or lose
your life, and never touch treasure...

308
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,210
There are more pirates like
that than you can count!

309
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,330
Don't be so upset, old guy!

310
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,560
It's a good thing we
came after 20 years!

311
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,670
30 years later and you
might've been dead!

312
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,280
Straw Hat...

313
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,230
--Luffy...
--He's...

314
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,340
You've made this much
of a fool of yourself!

315
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,720
All you got left now is the One Piece!

316
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,320
Come be a pirate again with us!

317
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,160
You're... inviting me?!

318
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,250
No one's even tried to talk to me
before when they saw me like this!

319
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,630
How many years it's been
since I trusted someone!

320
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,350
Thank you...

321
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,470
You're really gonna stay
on this island, old guy?

322
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,470
Yeah, Straw Hat.
Even if there is no treasure,

323
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,030
there's something else I want to protect.

324
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,150
Eh?

325
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,500
Something you want to protect?

326
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,420
I've shared hard times and happy
times with these guys for 20 years.

327
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,760
I can't leave them now.

328
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,080
Now that I know there's no treasure,
I somehow finally feel free.

329
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,420
I think I can really
live a life I want now.

330
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,430
Plus, I've actually grown
a bit fond of being in this box!

331
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,450
Oh! That's too bad, then!

332
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,290
You're a neat old guy, too!

333
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,400
So the weird creatures
are your true friends...

334
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,200
He's the weirdest creature
of them all, though!

335
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
Say what?!

336
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,540
See ya! Take care!

337
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,110
Bye!

338
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,820
Straw Hat...

339
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,260
Strive for your dream, for me.

340
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,260
You, if anyone, will surely get

341
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,090
the legendary treasure,
the One Piece!

342
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,910
And then...

343
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,620
buy the world!

344
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

345
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

346
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,950
before someone else could
beat me to it

347
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:52,550
If the world is going to change

348
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:59,560
before I can even attain my dream

349
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:06,640
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

350
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:20,020
so that my memories won't fade

351
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,780
Hey, Zoro. When did you start
using the Three-Sword Style?

352
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,880
Oh, it--

353
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,360
You're so dumb! Zoro would
never tell anyone about himself!

354
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,250
Actually...

355
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,230
One sword is different
from the others, right?

356
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,950
--He just couldn't get a full set!
--Hey!

357
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,700
It's just some ordinary old sword?!

358
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,320
Shut up, you guys!

359
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,880
"The Three-Sword Style's Past!
Zoro and Kuina's Vow!"

361
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,130
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
