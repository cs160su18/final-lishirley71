00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered
just before his death

6
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

7
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,200
My treasure?

8
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,470
If you want it, you can have it!

9
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,820
Find it!

10
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

11
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,260
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,700
During their voyage in
search of Fishman Island,

14
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,680
Luffy and friends met the mermaid, Camie.

15
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,920
To save Camie's friend Hatchin,
who had been captured by

16
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,730
a kidnapping gang, the Flying Fish Riders,

17
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,820
the crew headed to the Flying
Fish Riders' hideout.

18
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,840
Whether it's from the sea
or the sky, bring it on!

19
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,740
I'll go nuts on 'em!

20
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,210
Boys!

21
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,450
It's battle time!

22
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,200
Yeah!

23
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,390
"Tragedy! The Truth Hidden
Behind Duval's Mask!"

24
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,220
Well, now, which one's
got the most fight in it?

25
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,600
Hey, hey, hey!

26
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,190
That's the one!

27
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,640
Gotcha!

28
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,820
Wha?

29
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,890
I'm takin' over!

30
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,070
H-Hey!

31
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,270
Whoo! This is awesome!

32
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,120
Yeah!

33
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm flying!

34
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,640
Luffy's flying one of them!

35
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,130
Leave him be.

36
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,010
Eat this!

37
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
Bombs!

38
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,390
Damn!

39
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,020
Nami-san! Robin-chan! Are you okay?

40
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,110
That was close! They almost got us!

41
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,110
Damn them. If they'd hit the ladies,
I would've had to kill them.

42
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,370
Hoist the sails! They're in the way!

43
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,870
Right!

44
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,660
We're gonna dive!

45
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,220
Roger!

46
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,280
Luffy!

47
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,810
Luffy-san!

48
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,010
Wait! You idiots!

49
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,690
What do you think you were doing
in the middle of a fight?!

50
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,970
Sorry...

51
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,610
And why did you guys try to save him?

52
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,780
You've got powers!

53
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
Sorry...

54
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,790
I... I'm sorry for causing trouble...

55
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:51,010
Think of how we felt, having to save
you three lumps who can't swim!

56
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,300
Idiot! Don't make more work for us!

57
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,480
The Macro Pirates!

58
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,640
Now's our chance! Get Camie!

59
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Right!

60
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,690
Hey, Straw Hats! Pay attention to us!

61
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,690
Luffy-chin!

62
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,320
Camie! Pappug!

63
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,870
Camie! Pappug!

64
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,220
I'm free from the cage and the binds!

65
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,570
Thanks, Roronoa! You're a good guy!

66
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,090
Just following captain's orders, idiot.

67
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,390
Hachi!

68
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,430
Hatchin!

69
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,420
You guys took advantage of
the fact that I couldn't move

70
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,900
to beat me up, didn't you?!

71
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,340
Yeah, yeah! I didn't get
to do enough beating!

72
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,920
I'll use my Fishman Karate to finish you!

73
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,490
You really have no luck!

74
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,960
Since you kept mouthing off at us,

75
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,580
we're gonna pound you even more!

76
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,710
Let's go! I'll stain the sea red with
the new Goldfish Fencing techniques

77
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,010
I developed just for you!

78
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,260
Hatchin!

79
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,930
Here we come!

80
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,810
Takoyaki Punch!

81
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,440
We'll let you off the hook for today!

82
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,880
Hatchin!

83
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,020
Camie! Pappug!

84
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm so glad you're safe, Hatchin!

85
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm sorry, Camie, Pappug!

86
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,670
I meant to come save you!

87
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,950
Don't worry about that, Hachi!

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,330
Look out!

89
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,410
Don't forget, this is our hideout!

90
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,980
The ones who are gonna sell you all are us,

91
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,210
the Flying Fish Riders!

92
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,830
Roronoa!

93
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,140
Zoro-chin!

94
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,600
You left the fight too soon.

95
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,150
Leave the rest to us and go hide.

96
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,540
Thank you for everything, Roronoa!

97
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,160
I'm really sorry for what I did back then!

98
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
Back then?

99
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,830
I caused you so much pain
with my Six Swords Style.

100
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,330
Not one of those swords even hit me!

101
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,630
Really? They didn't?

102
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,250
Here they come, Chopper!

103
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,210
Take this, scum!

104
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,240
Fire!

105
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,700
Bullseye! Did you see that?!
My condolences, suckers!

106
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,310
You're awesome, Usopp!

107
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,910
Would anyone like to try the Zero Fight?

108
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,020
Zero Fight?

109
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,900
Sounds fun! But if I'm gonna do
it, I'm giving it all I've got!

110
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,590
You'll give us plenty of
medical coverage, right?

111
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,130
How about a million?

112
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,330
It's a deal, Head! I'm going!

113
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,990
Outta my way!

114
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,690
Some huge guy is coming this way!

115
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,440
He's swinging an iron rod!

116
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,830
He isn't holding the handlebars.

117
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,340
He's not planning to
charge us head-on, is he?

118
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,550
What?!

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,630
The ship won't withstand
a crash from that monster.

120
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,890
Luffy, you go after the fish.

121
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,810
All right!

122
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,750
You're about to find out
that a crash at this speed

123
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,470
is like being hit by a meteorite!

124
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,400
Sanji's right! He's charging right at us!

125
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,860
But the impact of that crash
is gonna be just as hard...

126
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,470
...on you!

127
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,300
Gum-Gum...

128
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,870
Balloon!

129
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,250
This'll be dinner tonight!

130
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,760
You were both so cool!

131
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,850
Seeing it up close, it really is big.

132
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,190
Damn! The usual methods aren't
working on these guys!

133
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,180
Usopp!

134
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,000
There are more of them flying
around than I realized!

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,120
How many do we have to
bring down to finish this?

136
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,210
Damn! I wanna ride one!

137
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,400
Don't think I've given up after last time!

138
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,880
Give up! I'm not saving you again!

139
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,050
How can this be?

140
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,520
What's wrong, Brook?

141
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,800
My first battle as one of the Straw Hats,

142
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,730
and I nearly drowned...

143
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,710
If I can't be of use now,
I'm a failure as a man!

144
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,330
How many of those flying
fish can I bring down?

145
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,340
I cannot say, but I can show you...

146
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,690
what I can do!

147
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,910
He can really jump!

148
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,620
What's that skeleton guy doing?!

149
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,580
I'll skewer him!

150
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,000
Lullaby Song.

151
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,170
Wow! They all fell... asleep...

152
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,590
You guys, too?!

153
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,390
Music is

154
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,600
power!

155
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,850
Pardon me!

156
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,610
Whoa! I fell asleep!

157
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,410
Damn that guy! What was that?

158
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,330
He must've used some kind of dirty trick!

159
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,180
It was no trick.

160
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,990
It was music!

161
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,710
Wait!

162
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,330
That Brook's pretty good!

163
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,510
It's getting fun now!

164
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm going, too!

165
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,100
Wait, Luffy! Not again!

166
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,350
All right, gotcha!

167
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,920
If you try to go under, you'll pay!

168
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,270
Hey!

169
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,730
He's asleep!

170
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,900
Hey, you! Wake up!

171
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,450
That jerk! He dove in to the Head's room!

172
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,020
You saw, didn't you?

173
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,560
Hey! You're—

174
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,550
You know me, don't you?

175
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,030
Roronoa!

176
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,100
Zoro-chin!

177
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,550
I can't run any longer!

178
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,210
My legs are about to cramp up!

179
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,120
Uh, not that I have any muscles to cramp...

180
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,720
You really went all out, Brook.

181
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,530
You took out a lot of the flying fish.

182
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,720
I had to do something useful...

183
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,840
But... I need a break...

184
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,520
Zoro-san, you're still suffering from
the damage you took at Thriller Bark...

185
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,690
It's not enough to let
these fish bring me down.

186
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,740
Don't worry.

187
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,190
You let your guard down, Roronoa!

188
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,290
Six Swords Style!

189
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,370
Tentacle Sword Overload!

190
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,720
Huh... You saved me?

191
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,660
That's right. 'Cause you
weren't paying attention.

192
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,580
Hatchin! You were so cool!

193
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,350
That's my boy, Hachi!

194
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,040
Really?

195
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,360
Die, fishman!

196
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,820
Pardon me!

197
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,690
I thought I was a goner! Thanks!

198
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,290
You're welcome.

199
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,790
I told you, you left the fight too soon.

200
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,460
Don't rush in individually! Formation!

201
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,450
Formation (Hentai)

202
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,930
Pervert?

203
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,420
Pervert (Hentai)

204
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,430
You talking to me?

205
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,230
Attack in flight formation!

206
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,130
Formation (Hentai)  Flight (Hikou)

207
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,820
Perverted misbehavior?

208
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,090
Perverted (Hentai)  Misbehavior (Hikou)

209
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,880
You mean me?

210
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,100
Not you!

211
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,300
Here they come!

212
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,940
Here! Over here!

213
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,970
Come on down!

214
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,150
A woman?!

215
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,240
Seems like a waste, but our
orders were to kill you all!

216
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,740
You think you can kill me?

217
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,250
What?!

218
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,120
Too bad! That's Mirage Tempo!

219
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,500
Watch for thunder clouds ahead!

220
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,600
Dos Mano!

221
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,280
Clutch!

222
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,180
Carving Hoof Diamond!

223
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,570
Don't break formation!

224
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,980
You talking to me?

225
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,600
No, he's not!

226
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,810
Now!

227
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,480
Oh, they didn't mean me?

228
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,900
What the heck?! Guns don't work on him!

229
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,990
Strong Hammer!

230
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,990
Amazing!

231
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,290
They really are strong, Pappug!

232
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,770
I never would've thought
they could do all this.

233
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,630
I thought we'd just get
Hachi and hightail it home.

234
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,400
Take this!

235
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,330
Damn!

236
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,840
Franky, dock the ship!

237
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,490
They have the advantage as long
as we're drifting on open seas!

238
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,940
I know that. That's why I'm doing this.

239
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,730
These guys aren't giving
us time to move the ship!

240
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,400
Luffy!

241
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,390
Run! There's a big one coming!

242
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,620
The Iron Mask?!

243
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,370
A guy in a mask, and a cow!

244
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,340
A cow?

245
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,880
That's Motobalo's voice!

246
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,280
The Head's here!

247
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,810
You just let them shoot
you down left and right?

248
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,730
What is that?! Something just burst out!

249
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,360
You're not mosquitoes or flies!
You're Flying Fish Riders!

250
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,070
He trampled his own house down
to make his appearance...

251
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,910
I don't need this hideout anymore.

252
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,070
Not if I get to kill the Straw Hats!

253
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,930
We're sorry, Head.

254
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,830
We'll sink all of these guys to
the bottom of the sea right—

255
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,500
Move!

256
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,080
I have no need for fishmen,
mermaids, or gloves!

257
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,890
If you want to run, then get out of here!

258
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,960
I'm a starfish!

259
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,340
I'm not in the human trade
because I want to be.

260
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,430
You all know that very well, don't you?

261
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,850
Of course, Head!

262
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,280
Today is a joyous day.

263
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,360
The man I have wanted to kill
so badly that I dreamed about it

264
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,630
is right in front of me!

265
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,950
I'm so grateful! There truly is a God!

266
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,870
The man who showed up that day and
plunged me into the depths of Hell...

267
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,830
Hey, does it look like he's
talking in our direction?

268
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,630
On this day, here and now,
even if I go down as well,

269
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,460
I will kill you!

270
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,680
The pirate, "Black Foot" Sanji!

271
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,390
I have so longed to see you.

272
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,060
Crap! The Head's really mad now!

273
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,270
Huh? He wants to kill me?

274
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,650
Sanji, who's that guy?

275
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,480
Does he have some kind of grudge against you?

276
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,520
Maybe it's from when you
worked at the restaurant?

277
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,950
Try to remember!

278
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,220
That was three years ago...

279
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,640
All I ever did back then
was piss people off...

280
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,500
Just get shot! You'd get what you deserve!

281
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,540
Don't you play dumb, Black Foot!

282
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,180
It was just recently!

283
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,460
Watch it! Get down! They're harpoons!

284
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,840
But if it was recent, I'm even more stumped.

285
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,640
What is that? Something's
weird about these harpoons...

286
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,380
These are Scorpion's Poison harpoons.

287
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,500
If one pierces you, you'll
be dead in three minutes.

288
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,360
Feel my wrath!

289
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,700
Nami-san, look out!

290
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,240
Damn that bastard! I can't remember!

291
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,620
Who are you?!

292
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,030
I'll murder you and your whole crew!

293
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,420
I saw him without his mask.

294
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,920
You did? Who is he?

295
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,660
Don't be too surprised.
It's a face you know, too.

296
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,630
Me?

297
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,680
That fool!

298
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,690
Duval-sama's iron mask!

299
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,950
That's fine. Take a good
look at my scarred face.

300
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,790
Wha— Huh?!

301
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,830
No way...

302
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,540
What?!

303
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,300
He's...

304
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,510
Wow.

305
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,260
Oh, my...

306
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,680
I could cry!

307
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,590
I have waited for this day.

308
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,190
After I decided to kill
you, I took to the seas.

309
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,630
But searching for you was not easy.

310
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,570
You look nothing like your
wanted flyers, after all.

311
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:35,700
Even if the Navy or bounty hunters saw
you, they might totally overlook you!

312
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,420
No, that's not true.

313
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,040
They do find you!

314
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,130
Head...

315
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,130
They find you, and they say...

316
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,180
"I found you,

317
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,560
Black Foot Sanji!"

318
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,300
And then I tell them...

319
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,110
"I don't know who that is!"

320
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,650
"I'm not even a pirate!"

321
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,990
Stop screwing around!

322
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,760
The Sunny's in trouble!

323
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,050
We're gonna get sunk!

324
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,870
Hey, relax! This week, I'm the
most super I've ever been!

325
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,200
I'll show you the Sunny's true power!

326
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,100
Wow! The Sunny is amazing!

327
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

328
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,150
"Unleash the Sunny's Super Secret
Weapon, the Gaon Cannon!"

329
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
