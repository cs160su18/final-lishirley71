2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,340
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,900
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,870
Now's the time to set
sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,340
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,360
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,620
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,330
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,620
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,800
One Piece

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,750
The first round of the Davy
Back Fight is the Donut Race.

24
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,840
The Straw Hat team managed to
overcome various acts of sabotage...

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,430
...but Zoro and Chopper's boat
was knocked out of the race.

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,200
Only the Cutie Wagon,
Barrel Tiger, and It's a Raft remain!

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,570
The battle is between these three boats now!

28
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,560
"'Silver Fox' Foxy! The
Merciless Interference"

29
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,670
The race is really heating up!

30
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,550
The Long Coral Reef blocks
the course directly ahead!

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,660
In the lead is Porche-chan's Cutie Wagon!

32
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,140
The Straw Hats' Barrel Tiger
and It's a Raft desperately pursue!

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,400
Wow! They're like Chopper's antlers!

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,050
What is this long, protruding coral?

35
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,360
What kind of coral sticks out like that?

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,700
Look! It's causing strange-acting currents!

37
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,040
We can't just plunge in recklessly...

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,830
Yuck! I can't believe the
race has lasted this long...

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,790
Monda! We're counting on you!

40
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,320
But let's not forget there's someone
on land just hoping to interfere:

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,840
our boss, "Silver Fox" Foxy!

42
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,300
Just what does he have in store?!

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,520
--Get 'em, Boss!
--Yahoo! Just a matter o' time now!

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,650
Oh, what's this?! Both Straw Hat
boats have slowed a bit!

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,290
--C'mon, Nami! Paddle!
--Not yet!

46
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,410
But they're getting ahead!

47
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,620
I said not yet!

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
--Same goes for you, Sanji-kun!
--Your wish is my command!

49
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,950
The Cutie Wagon uses this
chance to continue forward

50
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,720
and plunge into the Long Coral Reef!

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,410
Let's go, Monda!

52
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait! Oh, my! What's happening?!

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Monda!

54
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,550
Oh... They came back.

55
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,260
Oh, my! The Cutie Wagon
has been sent backwards!

56
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,680
What in the world happened?!

57
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,430
No! Why?!

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,940
See? I knew something
was up with these currents.

59
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,490
Okay! Let's increase speed!

60
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,730
R-Right!

61
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,050
Follow us, Sanji-kun!

62
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,140
Aye-aye, Sir!

63
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,860
Try again, Monda!

64
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,830
This way!

65
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,010
What's this?! Both Straw Hat
boats have sped up!

66
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,540
All three boats are entering the
Long Coral Reef at the same time!

67
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,680
Hmm? The Barrel Tiger and
It's a Raft are staying inside!

68
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,100
Whoa! What the...?!

69
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,510
Ahh! There it is at last!

70
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,770
Devilish interference from you-know-who!

71
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,450
A smoke screen...!

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,960
What's that damn idiot doing?!

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,820
I can't see in front of us!

74
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,690
Oh, my!

75
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,940
It's too dangerous for the Straw Hat

76
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,700
boats to continue forward one bit!

77
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,740
Operation White Out is a great success!

78
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,300
Let's see you find your way
through this coral maze blind!

79
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,170
Success?

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,340
How in the...?!

81
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,040
They got through! With no
trouble at all! How did they do it?!

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,480
Just as I thought!

83
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,590
The Straw Hat boats slip through
the forest of coral with ease!

84
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,350
Meanwhile, the Cutie Wagon...

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,730
--Oh, no!
--...has been sent back again!

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,340
What's going on?!
The boat's moving on its own!

87
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,530
--This is a maze of sea currents.
--Of sea currents?

88
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,450
Yep. The whirlpool up ahead is

89
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,780
causing strange currents in this reef,

90
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,830
full of smaller whirlpools.

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,410
So we don't need to see ahead!

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,420
The currents will carry us through,
as long as we take the right entrance!

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,460
Awesome! That's the power of our navigator!

94
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,080
Hurray!

95
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,390
Way to go, Nami-san!

96
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,830
Curses!

97
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,730
But their joy is short-lived!
Beyond the coral forest is the Long Ring!

98
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,270
Huh?! It's just one "Long" after another!

99
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,780
Usopp! Quit freaking out and fire it!

100
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,080
--Fire what?!
--An Impact!

101
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,820
--I-I told you, we don't have it! Nope!
--Oh? Then what's this?

102
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,540
When did you...?!

103
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,040
Hurry! Before the whirlpool sucks us in!

104
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960
What's with the smile...?

105
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,800
You've used it before!

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,920
You know using it can bust your shoulders...!

107
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,220
--That's okay! I don't mind!
--'Cause it's my shoulder!

108
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,550
--Good luck!
--Hey, now!

109
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,680
Hurry! There's no time!

110
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,390
No wonder you seemed so calm!

111
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,850
You had this in mind from the start...

112
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,650
Well, it's been a nice life...

113
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,490
Treinta Fleurs!

114
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,580
--Okay, Long-nose!
--"Okay," my butt...

115
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,630
Fine!

116
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,500
Oh! The Barrel Tiger and
It's a Raft have sped up together!

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,250
More than just that! They're flying!

118
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,090
They're leaping right over Long Cape!

119
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,340
Will they land back in the water?!

120
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,440
No, wait!

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,430
Huh? Huh?

122
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,730
Huh, huh, huh? Huh?!

123
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,850
It snapped off...

124
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,170
The It's a Raft crashes
into pieces on Long Cape!

125
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,000
It can't continue the race!

126
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,380
What a shame! The It's a Raft
is now out of the race!

127
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,670
Sorry, Nami-san! Don't worry
about us! Just keep going!

128
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,490
Right!

129
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,640
But the Barrel Tiger takes
a miraculously big lead!

130
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,800
Does this spell defeat for
the indomitable Cutie Wagon?!

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,300
We underestimated them a bit!

132
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,180
Hang on tight, Porche-chan!

133
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,470
We're counting on you!

134
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,850
Combine!

135
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,860
Two Fish Engine!

136
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,020
No! They haven't lost yet!

137
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,740
Their fishman muscle and shark fin
combo doubles their engine speed!

138
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,590
They zip through the coral and
turbulent waves to close the gap!

139
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,540
The race is half over!

140
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,620
Meanwhile, the Barrel Tiger
paddles desperately!

141
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,000
Get up, Usopp!

142
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
--Where am I?
--Just start paddling!

143
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,980
Your arm is twisted in an odd direction.

144
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,510
What's that?

145
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,010
--It's a course marker.
--It says to go right.

146
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,300
Okay! Right we go!

147
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,810
Like we'd fall for that!

148
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,590
Oh, my! Our boss's Ploy #18,
"Operation Lie to Them," has failed!

149
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,030
Truly formidable! Does this girl
not believe anything?!

150
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,670
Shut up, you!

151
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,240
She's foul-mouthed, too!

152
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,320
The race continues!
Barrel Tiger is still in the lead!

153
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,150
What are these columns of water?!

154
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,180
They also clear the long waves
that reach high into the sky!

155
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,710
Natural phenomenon?!

156
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,230
Granny...

157
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,800
Boss, err, Granny...

158
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,010
Yeah... I think I'm done for...

159
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,350
Our boss unleashes a third nasty trick!

160
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,730
Oh! You on the boat! Please save me!

161
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,070
Unbelievable! She completely
ignores a helpless, sick grandmother!

162
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,000
Is she heartless, or does she
only care about herself?!

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,740
Whatever the case,
Navigator Nami has a heart of ice!

164
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,120
Will you shut up already?!
I'd never fall for that crap!

165
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,790
She's foul-mouthed, too!

166
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,750
Look! It's the goal!

167
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,590
The finish is close at hand!

168
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,510
Not so fast!

169
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,230
The Cutie Wagon has caught up!

170
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:25,320
Who will be the winner of
Round #1's Donut Race?!

171
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,930
Who will be the winner?!

172
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,370
I told you...

173
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,830
Cut it out! You're annoying!

174
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,640
She even sees through "Operation Fake Goal"!

175
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
Formidable! Truly formidable!

176
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,020
I have a question for her now!
What does it mean to "believe"?

177
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,120
I don't care!

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,020
Oh, it's too late! Her heart's
already closed! She's a heathen!

179
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,230
The real goal is near, though.

180
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,980
--No more Impacts!
--Yeah, I know!

181
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,130
Meanwhile, Porche-chan's team has
tragically stopped at the fake goal!

182
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,900
--What happened to the race?
--Hey! Where is everyone?!

183
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,820
The purity of your heart is dazzling!

184
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,160
But you've been duped!
Pay attention, Porche-chan!

185
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,150
So many idiots!

186
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,540
I'll be too embarrassed to live
if we lose to these guys!

187
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,920
They'll take our crew too! That's even worse!

188
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,760
Oh, no! This goal is a fake!

189
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,670
What?! Who would be so evil?!

190
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,340
Eep!

191
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,260
The Barrel Tiger is finally
approaching Long Bamboo Cape!

192
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,500
The goal is just beyond it!
This is the homestretch!

193
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,600
He's right! There's the goal!

194
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,190
Wait!

195
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,910
But they're catching up to us!

196
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,570
We're no match for their speed!

197
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,420
That's it, Usopp! Can you
knock that bamboo down?!

198
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,240
The bamboo?!

199
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,780
All right!

200
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,740
--Like that?!
--Do more!

201
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,660
Full speed, Capote! Monda!

202
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,080
We have to sink them!

203
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,170
Take this! And this! And this!

204
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,760
Wow! Bingo!

205
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,250
Oh, no! Capote!

206
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,730
They'll pay for this!

207
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,410
Cutie Baton!

208
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,650
What's that? Flower magic?

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,690
Flower Shurikens!

210
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,290
Ah, they're throwing stars... Yikes!

211
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh, no! We've sprung a leak!

212
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,330
It's okay! We can make it!
The goal's right there!

213
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,160
Let's make a run for it!

214
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,130
Round #1 of the Davy Back Fight,
the Donut Race,

215
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,420
is about to reach a conclusion!

216
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,350
Stay strong, Monda! We
can't let them beat us!

217
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,040
We'll lose if we don't do something!
Stay in line with them!

218
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,070
Right, Boss!

219
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,570
Which one is winning?!

220
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,040
--Made it in time!
--All right! Nami's team is winning!

221
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,640
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

222
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,530
You speedy ladies are lovely!

223
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,370
Man, you guys almost won...

224
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,410
Huh? We are winning!

225
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,870
For now! But look!

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,210
--Our boss is there!
--So?! What can he do now?!

227
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,270
Our boss is just like you.

228
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,840
He has Devil Fruit powers.

229
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,790
Slow-Slow Beam!

230
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,660
And the winner is the Cutie Wagon!

231
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,440
Our idol, Porche-chan, has won the

232
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,040
first round of the Davy Back Fight!

233
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,030
All right! Way to go!

234
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,200
Oh! Thanks, everyone!

235
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,950
--You're the greatest, Porche-chan!
--It's only natural I won!

236
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,230
Now let's swipe us a crew member!

237
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,880
No one's a match for the Foxy Pirates!

238
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,310
Wha...?

239
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,180
All right! Time for you to
hand over a crew member!

240
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,200
Are you guys hurt?! Are you okay?!

241
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,760
Yes, we're all right.

242
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,070
What happened?

243
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,740
Beats us...

244
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,170
That's what we'd like to know!
Did we end up losing?

245
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,550
You were about to win, but then you

246
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,490
suddenly got slow and they passed you!

247
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,660
There's no need to be mystified!

248
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,120
It was caused by Slowmo Photons!

249
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,880
Hey! What did you do to Nami's team?!

250
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,840
Slowmo Photons...?

251
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,390
They're a type of particle
unlike anything currently known.

252
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,440
Whatever this light touches--

253
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,780
whether it's alive, a liquid, or even a gas--

254
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,580
physically loses a fixed amount of speed

255
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,440
while retaining all other energy.

256
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,900
I don't get it! Are you stupid or something?!

257
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,860
--He snapped at me...
--Oh, no! Boss!

258
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,820
But that sounds too ridiculous...

259
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,820
...to be real?

260
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,510
You surely know that such childish

261
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,910
claims have no merit in these waters!

262
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,040
Everything they touch slows down!

263
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,710
That's the power of Slowmo Photons!

264
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,290
Oh, now that makes sense!

265
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,130
After eating the Slow-Slow Fruit,
I became a "slow person"

266
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,260
capable of producing these
particles from my body!

267
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,340
Observe its power!

268
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,760
Yikes! He slowed a flying cannonball!

269
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,970
Slow-Slow Beam!

270
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,040
The effect lasts approximately 30 seconds.

271
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,230
It'll regain its original speed afterward,
as if nothing had happened.

272
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,280
Can't believe your eyes? This is--!

273
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,530
Boss!

274
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,870
Crap! So that's what happened to us?!

275
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,960
So this is the reason they're
strangely confident about the game.

276
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,620
What a joke of a power...

277
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,350
Do you get it now?! You lost!

278
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,210
Victory in Round #1's Donut Race...

279
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,220
goes to us!

280
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, my! You were so close, too!

281
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,390
That concludes Round #1!

282
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,310
Now for the long-awaited spoils of war!

283
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,330
It's time to call one member
of the opposing crew!

284
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,780
The first person I want is...

285
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,280
you!

286
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,300
The ship doctor! Tony Tony Chopper!

287
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,000
Me?!

288
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,200
Bring him here at once!

289
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,170
Oh, no! Chopper!

290
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,030
What a rare creature!
You're way softer than I imagined!

291
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,120
Oh, Boss! Let me touch him too!

292
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,590
Nauseatingly cute!

293
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,160
He's ours now!

294
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,340
Chopper!

295
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,180
So that creep was after Chopper?

296
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,660
Well, I guess he is the
rarest of rare animals...

297
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,280
He's into cute things?

298
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,940
Or furs, perhaps?

299
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,790
This is no time to chat!

300
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,450
This is serious!
They just took our friend!

301
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,780
Guys...

302
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,320
All right, Dr. Chopper.
You're a member of my crew now.

303
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,290
You need to pledge loyalty to me!
Now put on this mask...

304
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,230
Guys...!

305
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,750
I'm sorry we lost, Chopper...!

306
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,780
Damn!

307
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,810
This is a true rarity!

308
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,140
A talking reindeer! Amazing!

309
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,310
Let's be buddies!

310
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,690
Yo! Comrade!

311
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,320
Guys!

312
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,950
I only set sail so I could be with you guys!

313
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,330
No! I-I don't want this!

314
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,170
Luffy! I only set sail
because you invited me to!

315
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,590
I don't wanna go with these guys...!

316
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,640
No! I'm the Straw Hat Pirates'
ship doctor, Tony Tony Chopper!

317
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,390
I don't want this!

318
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,190
Quit your griping, Chopper!

319
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,400
You're being a poor sport!

320
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,240
Zoro...

321
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,190
You're the one who decided to set sail!

322
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,640
No one else is to blame if
you end up dying somewhere!

323
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,070
Only you are!

324
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,420
We agreed to this game.

325
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,790
Usopp, you, and everyone else did their best!

326
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,460
No one in the pirate world would
sympathize with your tears!

327
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,390
A real man...

328
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,550
...would roll up his sleeves and
watch the rest of the contest quietly!

329
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,750
How can you say that?!
Don't you know how he feels?!

330
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,530
All right! Do anything you like with me!

331
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,850
Chopper...

332
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,400
All right!

333
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,170
--Whoa!
--That swordsman is awesome!

334
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,670
All right! Teach 'em a lesson, Zoro!

335
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,320
Get Chopper back!

336
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,850
--Let's take him next, Boss!
--This reindeer's got guts!

337
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,740
Let's get the second round started.

338
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,410
So moving! I'm moved to tears!

339
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,330
Yeah. There's still two rounds left.

340
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,750
We're gonna take back our precious
emergency food... and then some.

341
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,690
Sanji! We're counting on you!

342
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,630
The exchange is finished

343
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,970
as the Davy Back Fight suddenly
explodes with excitement!

344
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,280
Huh? Wait, Chopper's in the second round.

345
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,640
--But they took him.
--You're right.

346
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,060
That's the real thrill of this game!

347
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,510
We told you!

348
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,810
You can't change your roster!
No replacements allowed!

349
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,270
In other words, only the other
two Straw Hat contestants

350
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,830
can participate in Round #2's Groggy Ring!

351
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,470
Team Foxy already has the advantage!

352
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,280
What?!

353
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,910
You can drop out too, if you want.

354
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,490
No, but you can, loser.

355
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,210
I find it hard to believe
they'll work as a team...

356
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,330
--Say what?!
--Stop that!

357
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,390
I'll now explain the rules of Groggy Ring!

358
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,550
There's a field, and two goals!

359
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,560
Knock the balls into them and you win!

360
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,280
However, the balls are no ordinary balls!

361
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,660
They're people!

362
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,310
Both teams, select someone to be a ball!

363
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,060
Which of you's gonna be the ball?!

364
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,890
Here's your ball mark!

365
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,650
Who made you boss?!
You be the ball, Moss Head!

366
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,050
Oh, there it is! Their entrance song!

367
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,240
It's the undefeated elites of Groggy Ring!

368
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,120
Yes! Defeat is impossible for them!

369
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,040
Crush 'em!

370
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:19,010
The famous Groggy Monsters
have just taken the field!

371
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,590
At the lead is "Full Dash" Hamburg!

372
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,640
He's followed by "Tackle Machine" Pickles!

373
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:34,230
Last but not least is Big Pan the wotan:
a half-fishman half-giant!

374
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,150
This is literally a monstrous march!

375
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,610
Now, then!

376
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,860
What is that?!

377
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,370
What is that giant fishman?!

378
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,290
They're putting the ball mark on him!

379
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,120
Let's see you win this!

380
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,550
Seem like a good match?

381
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,380
Yep.

382
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,230
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

383
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,780
Chasing after something constant

384
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,410
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

385
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,660
Even when we're exhausted

386
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,830
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

387
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,250
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

388
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,170
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

389
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

390
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,930
We pray to this endless
sky that we look up at

391
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,020
Eternally... Eternally...

392
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,810
Wild fantasies from our childhood

393
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,650
We trace unforgettable memories

394
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,320
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

395
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

396
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,950
Together we entrust our feelings

397
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,540
We go beyond the changing time

398
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,330
Eternally... Eternally...

399
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,490
--What are you doing?!
--Huh? Look who's talking!

400
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,280
I'll chop you up if they score a goal!

401
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,050
Shut up! Don't try anything funny!

402
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,470
You get thrown around too easy!

403
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,760
I don't need you to give me backup!

404
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,730
It's only 'cause I can't count on you!

405
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,020
They're funny! They're fighting
even during the match!

406
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

407
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,110
"Round 2! Shoot It into the Groggy Ring"

408
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,080
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
