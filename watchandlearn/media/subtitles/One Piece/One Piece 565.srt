00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,660
Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660
Make waves, jump from your sleep

It’s important not to wake up

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,190
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,610
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,420
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,920
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

73
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,640
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

74
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,300
and his friends venture into that sea.

75
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,530
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

76
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,190
On their way to the New World,

77
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,280
Luffy and his crew reached
the Fish-Man Island

78
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,380
located 10,000 meters below sea level,

79
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,320
where the New Fish-Man Pirates

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,750
who are looking to destroy
the Ryugu Kingdom...

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,740
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after

82
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,280
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

83
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,520
The Straw Hats find
themselves caught up in the

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,620
turmoil and involved in an all-out war.

85
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,850
Now, Hordy's merciless plot puts the

86
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,580
Fish-Man Island in unprecedented danger!

87
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,380
Straw Hat! Please!

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,410
We don't need the past!

89
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,010
Reset our history to zero!

90
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,390
Wipe out those phantoms who shut
the island away from the sun!

91
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,720
Bring the Fish-Man Island back...

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,940
...to zero!

93
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,560
Brother-hoshi.

94
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,200
As long as you let me handle
it my way, don't worry.

95
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,200
Our minds were made up when
we arrived at the plaza that,

96
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,720
along with Jimbei, we wouldn't
let anyone harm the island!

97
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,410
Leave it all up to us, Brother-hoshi!

98
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,870
We're friends, right?

99
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,850
You can't get away from me!

100
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,390
Hordy-sama!

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,530
Yowahoshi!

102
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,640
Stay with me! I promise
I won't let you be hurt!

103
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,810
Okay!

104
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,600
"Luffy's All-out Attack! Red Hawk Blasts!"

105
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,940
Oh? Huh?

106
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,050
I lost him.

107
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,970
The guy in stripes.

108
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,680
Where did he go?

109
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,010
Fool! I'm here!

110
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,820
You're gonna be dead before you notice!

111
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,590
Take this!

112
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,200
Camouflage Carpet!

113
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,200
Huh?

114
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,290
I heard a voice around here!

115
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,240
Z-Zeo-san got...

116
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
...Stabbed!

117
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,470
How was that, Skeleton?

118
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,800
My weapon-destroying technique
called Body Sword Crush made...

119
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,290
...the tip of your sword crumble...

120
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,230
I stabbed you.

121
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,100
He still has too much pride!

122
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,370
Just think that way and get defatted...

123
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,990
Get defeated!

124
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,880
This time, he...

125
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,510
...Stumbled.

126
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,320
Shh! Don't say that.

127
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,450
You just fumbled your words.

128
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,450
Hey!

129
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,700
You dumbhead!

130
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,550
Oh? Oh?! I lost him again! Where did he go?!

131
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,810
Hidden Flail...

132
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,940
...66 Neck!

133
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,180
I learned something...

134
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,430
...in the last 2 years,

135
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,290
about the true power of
the Revive-Revive Fruit.

136
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,250
When people die,

137
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,990
their souls must go to the next world.

138
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,500
But my soul,

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,020
in order to keep its existence in this world,

140
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,980
radiates a strong energy almost
like other corporeal beings.

141
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,900
It enables me to rock a crowd

142
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,990
of people better than anybody
else when I play music.

143
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,000
I can draw them into my world and
even create illusions for them.

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,680
Even when my soul leaves my
body, people can see me clearly.

145
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,990
I certainly exist in this world.

146
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,480
I did it!

147
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,910
I took down one of the Straw Hats!

148
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,790
No, you didn't.

149
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,090
What keeps me alive in this world
is neither bodily organs...

150
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,260
...nor muscles.

151
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,250
It's my...

152
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,940
...soul!

153
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,900
What?!

154
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,110
Oh! I've got a lot of spunk! All right!

155
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,600
He's pretending he wasn't surprised!

156
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,660
Did you get it?

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,670
So, in other words, as long
as my bones don't get damaged,

158
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,210
your attack can't pierce me to the bone.

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,680
And,

160
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,360
this sword cane which the Longarm
Tribe sharpened for me -

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,830
it's called Soul Solid!

162
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,320
Its soulful slash will make you feel

163
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
the cold air from the land of the dead!

164
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,290
It's the "Freezing Sword"!

165
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,580
Have a good look!

166
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,590
That's awesome, Brook!

167
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,290
The Freezing Sword - how cool is that?!

168
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,000
That's my Soul King!

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,510
Oh, thank you very much.

170
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,440
Oh! Oh no! Dammit!

171
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,770
I lost him again!

172
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,150
I have to keep it up too!

173
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,320
Everybody's gained skills
to go on to the New World!

174
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,500
Concerning your friends?

175
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,040
Don't worry!

176
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,750
I'll make sure you all get
drowned in the deep sea!

177
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,420
Special Attack!

178
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,600
Fireball Cutter!

179
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,050
Green Star!

180
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,720
Whoa! Ouch, ouch, ouch!

181
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,170
Green Star!

182
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,270
Green Star!

183
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,810
Green Star!

184
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,440
You bastard!

185
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,280
Looks like you're a burden to the Straw Hats!

186
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,740
You didn't hit me at all!

187
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,200
Don't rush around, mole shark.

188
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,710
I'm a cookie-cutter shark!

189
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,560
I just...

190
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,680
...finished setting a trap!

191
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,230
Luffy-sama!

192
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,810
Hordy-sama is coming!

193
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,080
You wouldn't let anyone harm the island?

194
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,320
Give it your best shot!

195
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,320
Second Gear!

196
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,990
Gum-Gum...

197
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,410
...Jet...

198
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,300
...Bazooka!

199
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,970
It's not working!

200
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,510
Luffy-sama!

201
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,010
It's no use, Straw Hat.

202
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,070
We were granted power from heaven!

203
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,270
Give it up! You can't stop the Noah now!

204
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,830
And you will lose everything!

205
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,630
No, I'm gonna finish the
whole thing with this one!

206
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,630
You can't finish anything!

207
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,960
Drop dead!

208
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,050
Second Gear - Armament!

209
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll never...

210
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,410
...let anyone die again!

211
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,030
Gum-Gum...

212
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,530
I'm gonna bite your arm off!

213
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,290
...Red Hawk!

214
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,920
Luffy-sama!

215
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,510
Straw Hat!

216
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,690
He...

217
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,440
He did it!

218
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,360
Straw Hat Luffy-san defeated...

219
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,990
...Hordy, the captain of
the New Fish-Man Pirates,

220
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,670
finally!!

221
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,790
It's not over yet!

222
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,290
Yowahoshi, take me to the Noah!

223
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,750
Okay!

224
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,010
At your full speed!

225
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,180
Okay!

226
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,020
What?! No way! Captain Hordy lost?!

227
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,060
What's gonna happen to the Noah?!

228
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,610
This is it! For the island and all of us!

229
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,390
Run!

230
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,670
Zeo-san, please! You know this island is...

231
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,710
Don't be fooled!

232
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,720
Captain Hordy was chosen by heaven!

233
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,760
Some loser human could never beat him!

234
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,350
B-But if the Noah destroys the island,
we're getting nothing anyway!

235
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,360
Death is another way to get revenge.

236
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,060
Hate humans even in death!

237
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,220
Tragedies will become our flesh and blood.

238
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,530
And our grudge will never go away.

239
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,980
Somebody will take it over
and get our revenge for us!

240
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,500
There he is.

241
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,840
Captain Hordy and all
you officers are insane!

242
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,000
Humans made us insane!

243
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,010
Stop running!

244
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,350
Direct all of your anger toward humans-bogon!

245
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:53,520
Humans are responsible for every single
disaster that Fish-Men meet-zugan!

246
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,200
Are humans that terrible?

247
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,120
That's ridiculous!

248
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,840
I mean, when you look at history,

249
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,570
humans did horrible things to Fish-Men...

250
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,550
Stop!

251
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,920
Madam Sharley!

252
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,470
See it with your own eyes!

253
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,930
In the plaza and up in the sky,

254
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,230
humans are fighting against the
pirates from the Fish-Man District!

255
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,620
Is he a human, too?

256
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,160
There are some strange ones but...

257
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,950
...you have to see it with your own eyes!

258
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,020
If you don't, you have no
right to say something!

259
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,260
No matter what happens,

260
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,430
you have to look at things
with an impartial eye.

261
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,370
Those of you who won't fight
to the death will get

262
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,560
killed by me in order to leave
your hatred toward humans behind!

263
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,820
You can't do that to your own people!

264
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Oh, that was close! Thank you, Skeleton Mask!

265
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,740
It's you again.

266
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,500
You've never died before so don't
talk like you know all about it!

267
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,830
Get killed and leave hatred
behind? How ridiculous!

268
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,800
Nothing is left behind when you die!

269
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,760
All you can leave behind is your bones!

270
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,590
Very persuasive!

271
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,760
Thank you!

272
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,850
I don't like people who
devalue the lives of others!

273
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,860
I can't even stand their smell!

274
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,300
Even though I don't have a nose!

275
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,820
It's you guys who are devaluing lives.

276
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,410
It's so impressive that none
of you is trying to escape

277
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,120
but you humans will die once
the Noah hits the island!

278
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,710
Although I can't tell if
you're a human or not!

279
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,300
Our captain - Luffy will become
the King of the Pirates someday.

280
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,170
And he said it clearly.

281
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,770
That he wouldn't let anyone
harm the island and

282
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,440
we can leave it all up to him!

283
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,770
I believe in him so there
is nothing to worry about.

284
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,520
Now, I'll do my part.

285
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,830
I won't let you disappear
in front of my eyes again!

286
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,610
Although I don't have eyes!

287
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,870
How's this? Surprised?

288
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,340
Yeah, that's enough. Oh, I'm so surprised!

289
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,840
Oh yeah?

290
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,950
Now, shall we finish this up, Jimbei?

291
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,510
Yes, let's do it.

292
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,050
Hey, wait! I've lost my swords.

293
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,400
How can I fight now?

294
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,990
Don't ask me.

295
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,320
How annoying!

296
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,470
I'm gonna end this fight by
using a daring technique!

297
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,080
One, two...

298
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,970
On the third step, you will get
shot by me and that'll be it!

299
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,640
Don't talk nonsense!

300
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,310
Stop dreaming your stupid dream!

301
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,360
You weakling! Are you crying sour grapes?!

302
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,030
Oh boy, I'm losing my edge.

303
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,570
I used to bluff better in the past.

304
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,870
But now, I can actually do these things.

305
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,290
What the hell is that monster?!

306
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,260
Was it here before?!

307
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,990
Oh, that's...

308
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,100
Chopper!

309
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,810
Th-That little guy got bigger suddenly!

310
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,690
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

311
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,280
You didn't have to go out of control!

312
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,410
I'm okay, Usopp.

313
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,340
What's wrong?

314
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,010
L-Look at that!

315
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,030
H-Hordy is...

316
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,750
I can't believe it!

317
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,960
Luffy-sama!

318
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,010
Let's go!

319
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,630
There is air!

320
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,840
The Straw Hat crew finally
demonstrates its true power...

321
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,570
...and attempts to overpower
the New Fish-Man Pirates.

322
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,970
Meanwhile, Hordy, having derived
immeasurable power from the Energy Steroids...

323
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,990
...and the severely wounded Luffy...

324
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,230
...grapple in a final battle!

325
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,720
On the next episode of One Piece!

326
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,520
"Coming to an End! The Final
Decisive Battle against Hordy!"

327
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
