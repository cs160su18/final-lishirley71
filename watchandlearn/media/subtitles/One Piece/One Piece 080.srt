Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,370
We found an island!

22
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,210
An island?!

23
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,750
Oh! An island! We found an island!

24
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,630
Hey, Nami! Good for you!
There's an island! You can get better!

25
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,860
There's an island! An island! Island!

26
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,430
Island! Island!

27
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,430
Just go look.

28
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,510
An island!

29
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,290
All this snow! I'm so happy!

30
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,790
That's far enough, pirates!

31
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,680
Hey. I found people.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,850
But... they don't seem too friendly...

33
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,770
Attention, pirates! Leave this
place at once! This instant!

34
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,190
We came to find a doctor!

35
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,470
We have a sick person onboard!

36
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,930
We won't fall for that trick,
you filthy pirates!

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
They really hate our guts.
And we've just met, too...

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,900
Don't talk back!

39
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,870
They're shooting!

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,270
You didn't just do that!

41
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,570
Bastard!

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Stop, Sanji-san!

43
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,320
"An Island Without Doctors?
Adventure in a Nameless Land!"

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,880
Vivi!

45
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,050
Why, you--!

46
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,670
Aim!

47
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,810
No! Stop!

48
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,280
Fighting won't help anything!

49
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,870
I'm fine! It only grazed my arm!

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,150
In that case, we won't land here!
But could we ask for a doctor?

51
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,120
Our friend is suffering from a grave illness.
Please help! I beg you!

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,590
Vivi!

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,650
You're not fit to be captain, Luffy.

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,230
Not everything can be fixed
by acting recklessly!

55
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,610
If you start a fight here,
what will happen to Nami-san?

56
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,990
Yeah. I'm sorry! I was wrong!

57
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,040
Please call a doctor!

58
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,500
Please help our friend!

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,190
I will show you to the village.

60
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,780
Follow me.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,860
See? They understood!

62
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,350
Yeah! You're amazing!

63
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,120
I must warn you, the only doctor
we have here is a witch.

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,990
Witch?

65
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,650
You gotta be kidding me.
Nothing here makes sense...

66
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,970
What is this place, anyway?

67
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,390
This land still does not have a name.

68
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,610
A nameless land?
Does that really happen?

69
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,520
A bear!

70
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,850
Everyone! Pretend to be dead!

71
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,070
A Hiking Bear. They pose no danger.

72
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,700
Don't forget to bow.
It's proper hiking manners.

73
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,300
Okay! All better now!

74
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,000
See!

75
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,760
Now I can finally do
some real training!

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,430
I was getting sick of
that watered-down training,

77
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,900
and just watching the ship
is boring as hell.

78
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,770
Maybe I'll go for some cold-weather
swimming to suppress my self.

79
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,920
This is our village, Big Horn.

80
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,480
There are weird animals
walking everywhere...

81
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,550
That's snow country for ya!

82
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,450
Nami-san! We made it to a village
with people! It's a village!

83
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,120
Okay. Thanks for the help, everyone.

84
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,300
Those who aren't guards
can return to their work.

85
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,670
But, will you be alright by yourself,
Dalton-san? They're pirates!

86
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,370
I believe they pose no threat.

87
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,350
That's my hunch of many years
of experience. You can trust it.

88
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,570
What do we do?

89
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,170
If that's what Dalton-san says, then...

90
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,350
And they don't seem dangerous...

91
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,690
Yeah...

92
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,340
Alright, Dalton-san!
We leave the rest to you!

93
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,400
Be ever careful, Dalton-san...

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,620
Just call us again if anything happens!

95
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,550
They weren't this land's security forces?

96
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,850
They're ordinary citizens.

97
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,270
Come to my home for now.

98
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,960
Hey! Look, Luffy! A Hiking Bear!

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,950
Again?!

100
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,280
Oh, Dalton-san!

101
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,870
Gotta bow.

102
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,420
I heard there were pirates!
Are you okay?

103
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,800
Yes, everything is okay.
There's nothing to worry about.

104
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,630
Oh, Dalton-kun! I look forward
to the election in two days!

105
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,590
Everyone says they're
going to vote for you!

106
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,280
Y-you can't be serious!
I'm nothing but a sinful man!

107
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,910
Use that bed there.
I'll warm the place up.

108
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,290
I haven't told you my name yet.

109
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,570
I'm Dalton, captain of the
security squad of this island.

110
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,810
Please forgive our heavy-handed welcome.

111
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,790
May I ask you a question?

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,660
Eh?

113
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,180
I somehow feel like I've seen you before.

114
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,090
I-it's probably just your imagination!

115
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,050
Anyway, please tell us about this witch!

116
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,730
Nami-san's temperature was 42° C
when I checked it just now!

117
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,730
42°?!

118
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,700
Her fever's gone up for
three days in a row.

119
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,400
She'll die if it goes up any more!

120
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,140
Yes.

121
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,050
But we don't even know the cause of
her illness, or how to treat it...

122
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,910
We need a doctor! Anyone will do!
Where is this witch of yours?!

123
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,710
The witch, huh. Do you see those
mountains outside the window?

124
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,380
Yeah, those insanely tall--

125
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,100
Hyper Snowman!

126
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,540
Snowzilla, the snow beast!

127
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,360
Yeah!

128
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,390
Don't make me kick your asses!

129
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,690
Those mountains are known
as the Drum Rockies.

130
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,810
Do you see the castle at the top
of the tallest one in the middle?

131
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,270
Castle?!

132
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,970
That castle no longer has its king.

133
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,970
That warms me up...

134
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,870
Yeah, there it is.

135
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,070
What's so important about the castle?

136
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,650
The only doctor in the land,
Dr. Kureha, lives there.

137
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,950
People call her a witch.

138
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,980
What?! Of all the places,
why does it have to be so far away?!

139
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,960
Then call her here right away!
We have a critical patient!

140
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
Even if we wanted to,
there's no way to contact her.

141
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,800
Huh?! And she calls herself a doctor?!
What the hell is she like?!

142
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,300
As a doctor, she's very skilled.

143
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,070
But she's an eccentric old hag.
She's nearly 140 years old now.

144
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,030
Eh?!

145
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,970
140?! I think she might need help!

146
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,680
And, let's see...
She likes pickled plums.

147
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,480
What happens when people
here get sick or injured?

148
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,920
She comes down from the
mountain when she feels like it.

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,120
She looks for patients,
treats them, then, as payment,

150
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,700
she takes whatever she wants
from their houses before leaving.

151
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,330
Sounds like an unfriendly old hag!

152
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,170
Hey! She almost sounds like a pirate!

153
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,050
But how does such an old
woman go down that mountain?

154
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,510
It's an odd rumor...

155
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,000
but several people claim to have seen her

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,340
riding a sleigh through
the sky on moonlit nights...

157
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,360
And that's the reason
she's called a witch...

158
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,890
Some also saw her with a strange
creature they'd never seen before...

159
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,590
I knew it! See? It's a Snow Man!
It's a snowy mountain, after all!

160
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,490
I knew there'd be one!

161
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,300
A witch and a Snow Man?!
Oh, please never let us run into them!

162
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,480
She is the only doctor, but she's
a hag I'd prefer to stay away from.

163
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,610
All we can do is wait for the next
time she comes down the mountain.

164
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,670
You can't be serious...

165
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,050
Dammit! We can't wait for that!
Even as we speak, Nami-san is--!

166
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,120
Hey! Nami! Nami! Can you hear me?

167
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,730
What are you doing?!

168
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,350
Oh! She's awake!

169
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,070
Hey, the only way to see a
doctor is to climb a mountain.

170
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,160
We're gonna climb it!

171
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,020
Eh?

172
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,430
Don't be crazy!
What are you doing with Nami?!

173
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,120
It's okay! I'll carry her on my back!

174
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,570
That'll only make things even worse!

175
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,540
What's the problem?
We need to hurry, don't we?

176
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,400
That's true, but you can't!
Look at how steep and tall it is!

177
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480
I can make it.

178
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,850
Maybe you can make it,
but it'd be too hard on Nami-san!

179
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,050
But, look! If we fall,
we'll land in snow!

180
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,540
Even a healthy person would die
instantly after a fall from there!

181
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,260
Seriously! She's 6° C
over normal temperature!

182
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,880
Do you even get it?!

183
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,230
I need to get over this fast...

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,880
I need to hurry... for Vivi...

185
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,370
I'm counting on you, Captain!

186
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,080
That's more like it!
Just leave it to me!

187
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,280
I can't believe it!
Like captain, like navigator!

188
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,650
Do you know what condition
you're in, Nami-san?!

189
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,570
Are you sure you'll be okay?
It'll take hours to get there!

190
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,420
Old guy! Meat! Gimme meat!

191
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,550
Meat?

192
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,320
Alright! I'm comin' too!

193
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,290
Listen, Luffy! Don't fall even once,
or you can expect Nami to die!

194
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,130
Eh?! Even once?!

195
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,340
Wait! Hold still!
I need to tie this right!

196
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,200
All set.

197
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,370
Okay, I'm going to wait here.
I'd only get in the way.

198
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,370
Same here!

199
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,380
Got it!

200
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,880
Okay, Nami! Hold on tight!

201
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,870
Yeah...

202
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,990
If you're really set on going...
I won't stop you.

203
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,560
But at least climb up from the other side.

204
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,100
There are Lapins on this course.

205
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,450
Fierce, carnivorous rabbits.

206
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,220
If you encounter a pack of them,
you're as good as dead.

207
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,700
Rabbits? But we're in a hurry.

208
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,430
We should be fine. Right?

209
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah! I'll kick 'em!

210
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,510
Kick?! You can't be serious!
You'd be walking to your deaths!

211
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,770
It's okay!

212
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,680
Alright, then! Let's go, Sanji!
Before Nami dies!

213
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,710
What?! Don't say things that
could jinx us, you dumbass!

214
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,750
Will they really be all right?

215
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,430
Well, I'm not worried about those two...

216
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,430
But the question is if Nami-san's
strength will last long enough...

217
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,410
I hope they make it there safely...

218
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,710
What's wrong?

219
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,700
Come inside. It's cold out.

220
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,150
Oh, that's okay.
I want to stay outside.

221
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,170
Me, too...

222
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,180
I see.

223
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,150
Then I will join you.

224
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,820
We did have some, long ago...

225
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,750
Eh?

226
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Doctors. But they're all gone now,
for certain reasons.

227
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,210
They were all incredibly skilled...

228
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,770
We were even known as
an advanced medical nation.

229
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,960
So what happened?

230
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,250
This country was destroyed
just a few months ago.

231
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,220
At the hands of pirates!

232
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,260
Eh?!

233
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,150
The entire country?!

234
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,150
So that's why you were so nervous about us?

235
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:46,560
Yes. The word "pirate" is still
too much for everyone to handle...

236
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,440
I'm sorry about that.

237
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,240
But there were only five
people in that pirate group.

238
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,800
The captain called himself "Blackbeard,"

239
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,230
and he destroyed our country
in the blink of an eye

240
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,880
with his devastating power...

241
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,470
Only five pirates?!
You can't be serious!

242
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,770
Blackbeard?!

243
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,780
But there are some who say it was
actually good for the country.

244
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,110
There's nothing good about
a country being destroyed!

245
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,860
Yeah! That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard!

246
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,650
Thank you.

247
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,860
But people say that because the
monarchy that existed here until then

248
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,100
was appalling in the eyes of the citizens.

249
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,730
The country's former name
was the Drum Kingdom!

250
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,470
The king's name was Wapol!

251
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,230
He was the worst king possible!

252
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,590
Yes! That man! I remember him!

253
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,420
Wapol?!

254
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,310
It's gotten a little colder.
The wind's picking up.

255
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,770
So why aren't you wearing shoes?!
Just seeing that is painful!

256
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,830
This is my police!

257
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,430
Police?! You mean "policy"!

258
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,830
Yeah!

259
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,770
Anyway, did you know?
People in snowy countries never sleep!

260
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,110
Huh? Why's that?

261
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,830
'Cause they'll die if they go to sleep!

262
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,980
Don't be stupid!
There's nobody like that!

263
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,810
It's the truth!
Someone told me a long time ago!

264
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,190
Usopp, I bet.

265
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,510
No! I heard it in a pub in my village!

266
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,790
Then why did that Dalton guy have a bed?

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,610
That's a good point.

268
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Maybe it's for when he dies, then?

269
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,470
Yeah, right!

270
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,810
Okay, did you know this?

271
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,040
Women in snowy lands
all have silky-smooth skin!

272
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,870
How come?

273
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,650
Isn't it obvious?

274
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,120
Whenever you're cold,
you rub your skin for warmth.

275
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,590
So you get smooth skin.

276
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,680
So women in snowy places have
such silky-smooth, white skin!

277
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,230
How come it's white?

278
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,850
Because the color of the
constantly-falling snow dyes their skin!

279
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,130
Huh?! You're so dumb!

280
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,400
Like you're really anyone to talk!

281
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,940
And...

282
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,470
...quit being so damn annoying!

283
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,190
What was with that guy?

284
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,710
Hang in there, Nami-san!
We're gonna get you to a doctor!

285
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,990
The snow's really deep around here...

286
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,290
Hey, Luffy!

287
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,730
Run more smoothly!
You're gonna make Nami-san worse!

288
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,630
W-what are these?

289
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,580
They're white and big,
so they're polar bears! I'm sure of it!

290
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,000
Wait! You know Wapol?!

291
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,310
We don't just know him!
He's the pirate who attacked our ship!

292
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,190
I got rid of him, though.

293
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,530
But I do recall him saying
something about the Drum Kingdom...

294
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,200
Yes.

295
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,590
There's no question about it!
I remember clearly now!

296
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,070
I met him once at a monarch
meeting my father took me to

297
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
when I was very young!

298
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,960
Monarch meeting?!

299
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,090
Just who are you?

300
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,290
No, uhh, you see...

301
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,180
In any case, we met Wapol!
Yesterday, on our way here!

302
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,590
Yesterday?! Are you sure?!

303
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,810
But what's going on, then?!
He called himself a pirate, not a king!

304
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,070
He must be calling himself
that as camouflage.

305
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,630
Wapol is merely wandering the sea,
trying to return to this island.

306
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,630
So the people on that ship were
kicked out because they were no match

307
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,770
for the Blackbeard Pirates
when they attacked this country?

308
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,710
No match? It's not like that!

309
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,630
Eh?

310
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,120
When it happened, Wapol's army
didn't even try to fight!

311
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,120
In fact, the moment he learned
how strong the pirates were,

312
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,560
Wapol abandoned the country and was
the very first to flee out to sea!

313
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,500
That threw the entire nation into despair.

314
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,240
Is this what the king--

315
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,730
Is that what the king of
an entire country does?!

316
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,840
That's appalling!
A king abandoning his people!

317
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,610
Vivi...

318
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,120
You're exactly right.

319
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,290
But at least Wapol's
tyranny is finally over.

320
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,680
The remaining people on this
island have come together

321
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,570
to try to create a new country.

322
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,750
So what we most fear right
now is Wapol's return...

323
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,350
The return of his monarchy.

324
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,240
We must avoid that at all costs,
while people are still feeling unsure!

325
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,440
If we're to create a new,
peaceful nation on this island!

326
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,060
It jumped!

327
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,650
You gotta be kidding me!
How can it move like that?!

328
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,590
What is it, a gorilla?!

329
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,350
No! A polar bear!

330
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,230
It's a bunny!

331
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,650
You're the one who just
called it a gorilla...

332
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,660
These must be the Lapins that
Dalton was talking about!

333
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,840
This many of them?!

334
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,420
Oh!

335
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,130
Oh! Wapol-sama!

336
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,500
What is it, Chess?
Did you find Straw Hat's ship?!

337
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,890
No, Wapol-sama!
We've finally returned home!

338
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,070
What?!

339
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,610
How many months have passed
as we've wandered the sea?

340
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,120
It's our homeland! The Drum Kingdom!

341
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,790
Truly?!

342
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

343
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

344
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

345
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

346
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,420
So even,

347
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,630
if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

348
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,840
the ship will continue forward

349
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,940
Bon voyage!

350
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget about them!

351
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,950
I know I'm a fool,
but I gotta go

352
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,620
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

353
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,290
I know I'm a fool,
but I'm gonna fight

354
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,300
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

355
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,630
Do everything you can,

356
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,640
and you'll get a little nearer to any horizon

357
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,280
Listen, Luffy!
Don't you dare fight these guys!

358
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,850
Why not?

359
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,650
Nami-san will feel
the whole impact and die!

360
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,160
Okay! I won't fight!
But, what do I do?!

361
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,530
Just dodge! Dodge and run!
But don't retreat!

362
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,090
That's hard!

363
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,000
What?! The witch is
in the next town over?!

364
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

365
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,770
"Are You Happy?
The Doctor Called Witch!"

366
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,950
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
