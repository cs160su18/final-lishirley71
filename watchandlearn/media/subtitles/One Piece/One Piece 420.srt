2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,840
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,650
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,450
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,420
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,300
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,960
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,360
Leaving the female-only island of Amazon Lily

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,860
to rescue his brother Ace who
is waiting to be executed,

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,040
Luffy stowed away on a navy ship with
the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock's help

52
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,120
and headed to the Great Prison - Impel Down!

53
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,580
Meanwhile, the rest of the Straw Hat crew,

54
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,580
who had been ejected from the Sabaody
Archipelago by Bartholomew Kuma are...

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,940
"The Friends' Whereabouts! Bridging
the Islands and Vicious Vegetations!"

56
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,820
Love-Love Beam!

57
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,650
Are we gonna survive this trip?!

58
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,700
They'll never learn!

59
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,870
Luffy, the food is here!

60
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,240
Luffy?

61
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,160
Hey, haven't we reached Ace yet?

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes, I'm afraid it'll take more time.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,630
I see.

64
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,630
Oh! Yum-yum!

65
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,310
Luffy.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,520
Do you want some tea?

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,730
Yeah, please.

68
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,690
Yes, please.

69
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,910
Oh no!

70
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,420
A-All right, I'll make some.

71
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,990
Say, Luffy,

72
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,070
tell me about your friends.

73
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,870
Well, I mean, it's no big deal!
I'm just making conversation!

74
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,460
It's not like I want to know more
about you or something like that!

75
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,560
Well, which one of them should I start with?

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,220
Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, Brook,
Franky, Nami, Robin...

77
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,590
Nami? Robin?

78
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,340
There are girls?!

79
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,720
Yeah. You're spilling the tea water.

80
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,850
I'm sorry, but I can't be with you.

81
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,770
Why?! Why, Luffy?!

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,440
Because I'm with them!

83
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,860
No, I won't back off!

84
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,910
What're you talking about?

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,050
That's a person!

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,150
I've never seen clothes like these...

87
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,570
She's from somewhere else.

88
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,490
She's alive!

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,410
Are you okay?

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,300
Well... I'm not sure.

91
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,620
Where am I?

92
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,290
You're in Tequila Wolf, a
country in the East Blue.

93
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,760
Are you cold? Do you want
to come to our house?

94
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,380
If it won't put you out,
yes, I would like to.

95
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,940
Hey, hustle up!

96
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,040
Soran! Did you go out without asking again?!

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,340
You can't do that! You hid
from the officers, right?

98
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,300
Yes.

99
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,200
Who's that?

100
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,760
Seems like she's from somewhere else.

101
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,640
She was lying down in this snow.

102
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,410
A drifter?

103
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,720
Maybe, a wanted person.

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,040
Anyway, she wouldn't come to the
place like this if she were sane.

105
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,690
Looks like I'm not welcomed here. I'll go.

106
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,190
I'll look after her.

107
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,680
Don't be selfish!

108
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,850
What would you do if the officers find
out that we're giving a stranger shelter?

109
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,370
I'd take all the responsibility!

110
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,220
She's hopeless!

111
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,920
Where are you gonna hide her?

112
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,210
In my room.

113
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,850
In the loft?

114
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,360
It'll be okay for a while there.

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,180
Are you people serious? Shouldn't
we turn her in before it's too late?

116
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,450
It's too late. She's already in our house.

117
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,680
I don't wanna regret it later.

118
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,440
Keep me out of it!

119
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
Thank you!

120
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,420
Don't get any ideas. She has to
leave as soon as her wounds heal.

121
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,400
Even if she gets well, there's
nothing for her in this country.

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,330
They are kind.

123
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,410
Yes.

124
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,080
Thank you.

125
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,900
Something smells so nice.

126
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,690
I didn't use any perfume.

127
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,680
Maybe, that's the scent of the outside world.

128
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,510
The outside?

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,040
I haven't left this country since I was born.

130
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,980
Are you a traveler? Did you
come from a hot climate?

131
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,240
Yes, I've been traveling
around on a ship but...

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,400
Is it a big ship? What kind
of island did you come from?

133
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,600
Have you seen any beautiful
flowers or birds? And...

134
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,920
Soran! The break is over!
Hurry and get ready!

135
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,990
It's time to work.

136
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,920
You work this late at night?

137
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,000
We work all day and night.

138
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,230
You can rest.

139
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,640
Tell me about the outside world later.

140
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,520
Okay. I'll be waiting for you, Soran.

141
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,570
Yes.

142
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,910
I don't think that I can make it in time.

143
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,040
Oh, did I wake you?

144
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,780
Soran, you're so dirty!

145
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm okay.

146
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,620
What kind of work do you do?

147
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,540
--We are making a bridge.
--A bridge?

148
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,330
This country is on a bridge.

149
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,010
The bridge will connect
many islands together.

150
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,280
This construction has been
going on for centuries now.

151
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,850
That's what the officers say.

152
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,520
For centuries?

153
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,080
Tell me. Where are you from?

154
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
I'm from...

155
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,160
My home island no longer exists.

156
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,120
But I traveled many islands and oceans.

157
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,250
Soran?

158
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,280
What're these?

159
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,400
They're drawings of islands
all throughout the world.

160
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,030
I've never left this place so I
drew them out of my imagination.

161
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,370
But when I draw an island, it makes
me feel like I'm visiting that island

162
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,350
and I can forget how difficult life is!

163
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,930
These are wonderful!

164
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,920
This is the Sky Island!

165
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,900
Does the island in the sky really exist?!

166
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,110
--Yes.
--Tell me about your trip there!

167
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,860
All right.

168
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,780
Well... where should I start?

169
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,930
Wow, that's wonderful!

170
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,840
It seems like the outside world
is as much fun as I thought!

171
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:32,400
Every day they push us around and
work us until we're exhausted but

172
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,610
when I think about it, maybe
making a bridge isn't so bad!

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,340
When it links to a distant island someday,

174
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,320
anyone can travel freely
by crossing the bridge.

175
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,540
Then I'll travel all over the world

176
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,830
and draw pictures of actual islands!

177
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,150
That's a great dream!

178
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,640
Yes! So, tell me more!

179
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,580
Okay.

180
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,340
Can we join?

181
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,680
Of course.

182
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,190
The woman is in the loft.

183
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,540
Good job. Let's go!

184
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,900
Hey! Don't forget your promise
to get me out of this country!

185
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,360
--Don't move!
--W-What is this?!

186
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,830
--Outta my way!
--We're looking for the stranger!

187
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,130
If you resist us, we'll kill you!

188
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,080
What's happening?!

189
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,500
Somebody must've told the
officers! They're here for her!

190
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,010
What should we do?!

191
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,320
What do you want?

192
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,990
I heard that you're hiding a
suspicious woman in this house.

193
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,410
These days, people opposed to the
construction of the bridge threaten the order.

194
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,490
Turn her over!

195
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,040
We don't know a woman like that!

196
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,460
It's no use searching here!
We're tired so leave us alone!

197
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,530
Watch your mouth!

198
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,970
Auntie!

199
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,760
If you don't cooperate, we have to arrest
all of you and question you one by one.

200
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,160
You know what we do to get the
information we want, right?

201
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,370
Captain, I found these!

202
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,640
What is this crap?

203
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,940
Islands?

204
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,500
I drew them! Give them back!

205
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,360
You drew islands?

206
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,060
That's amusing! How silly!

207
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,020
Give them back!

208
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,150
Tell me where the woman is.

209
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,070
Then you'll get your drawings back.

210
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,700
I don't know!

211
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,030
Once again, where's the woman?

212
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,990
I don't know!

213
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,210
If you cooperate, we'll get
you out of here someday.

214
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,920
Then you can see the outside world for real.

215
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,190
I don't know!

216
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,090
One last chance!

217
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,590
Where is the woman?!

218
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't know!

219
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,540
You people won't leave this place
for the rest of your life anyway!

220
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,670
Take all of them in!

221
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,960
We're gonna torture them until they speak!

222
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
And show no mercy to the kid!

223
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,140
Come on, move!

224
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,720
Lady!

225
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,310
Clutch!

226
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,580
H-Hey, guys!

227
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,830
S-Stay away! P-Put your hands up!

228
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,270
I-I'm sorry! Forgive me!
Please don't hurt me!

229
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,640
I got you!

230
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,790
It's her! I got her cornered!

231
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,080
Hurry! Someone! I need backup!

232
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,280
What're you doing? Didn't you hear him?!

233
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,260
Isn't she the one that you're looking for?

234
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,430
Just go and get her!

235
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,370
You're not welcome here!

236
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,720
Captain...

237
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,480
What're you doing?! Go and cover him!

238
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,640
Yes, sir!

239
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,880
I'll let you get away for now!

240
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,340
But I won't forget your rebellious behavior!

241
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,640
We don't care!

242
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,530
Are you all right?

243
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,070
Lady...

244
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,880
This is a country of laborers.

245
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,410
Pull! Pull!

246
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,370
The people who work here are
criminals from various countries

247
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,140
or citizens of countries that refused
to be allied with the World Government.

248
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,690
On your feet! Let's go!

249
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,900
In other word, slaves.

250
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,000
How long until the bridge is complete?

251
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,360
I have no clue.

252
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,450
It's been under construction for 700 years!

253
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,010
700 years? For what purpose?

254
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,500
You don't need to know that.

255
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,040
You'll become one of laborers,

256
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,030
so all you have to worry about
is making the bridge!

257
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,310
This islands look like a flower blooming
in the ocean. It's called Bowin Islands.

258
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,690
Let's go Usopp Exploring Party!

259
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,110
Of course, I'm the leader!
Usopp the king of snipers!

260
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,820
And here is my crew!

261
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,950
They couldn't be here due
to unforeseen circumstances.

262
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,410
Where am I?

263
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,640
I wonder whether Luffy and others are alive.

264
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,920
They can't do anything without me.

265
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I know that they're crying for me!

266
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,780
Yeah, I'm sure!

267
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,060
I gotta hurry to save them!

268
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,260
Oh, just the wind.

269
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,270
The crew of Usopp Exploring Party
should always be on the lookout!

270
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm Usopp...

271
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,740
How can I get off this island? And...

272
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,690
Hey! Is anybody here?

273
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,580
Don't tell me this is a deserted island!

274
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,380
Ugh! It's the My-Heart-Will-Stop-Beating-
If-I-Don't-See-Anybody Syndrome!

275
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,780
Collapse!

276
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,170
How sad!

277
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,730
Hey! Isn't anybody here for real?!
Stop being shy and come out!

278
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,900
Ah, there you are!

279
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,120
How're you?

280
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,000
You seem to be doing a little well!

281
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,700
--Are you gonna eat that'n?
--Yeah, right!

282
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,610
But you saved me! Thanks,
Mr. Whoever-you-are!

283
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,380
My name is Heracles'n!

284
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,130
Wow! That's a cool name!

285
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,880
Oh? You think so'n?

286
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,340
I'm Usopp! Nice meetin' you!

287
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,600
Is this good to eat? I've
never seen a fruit like this!

288
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,060
It's fine'n! Usopp'n!

289
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,900
And my name is Heracles'n!

290
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,780
Yeah, OK, fine - that's cool.

291
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,250
It sure smells delicious...

292
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,620
Let's just lick it and see.

293
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,570
Usopp'n!

294
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,060
Boy! What was it?! Did
that plant try to eat me?!

295
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,390
Of course, they're man-eating plants'n!

296
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,340
Man-eating?!

297
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,160
Where the hell am I?!

298
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,470
This is the Swindling Forest - Glinston!

299
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,240
H-H-Help me!

300
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,990
And my name is Hera...

301
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
Zoro arrives at an old castle,

302
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,940
where he runs into Perona.

303
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,130
Zoro wants to return to his friends,
but for some reason, Perona stops him.

304
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,960
Around that time,

305
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,850
Brook is being hailed as
Satan, the king of demons!

306
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,040
"The Friends' Whereabouts! A Princess
Negativity and the King of Demons!"

308
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
