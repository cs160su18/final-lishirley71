2
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered
just before his death

6
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

7
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,200
My treasure?

8
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,470
If you want it, you can have it!

9
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,820
Find it!

10
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

11
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,060
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:30,090
Hold Land of Marie Jois

14
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,560
Bartholomew Kuma-sama has returned!

15
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,120
Don't be ridiculous!

16
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,000
Bartholomew Kuma, you're telling
me they escaped your powers?

17
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,270
Give me a better excuse than that!

18
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,340
I'm the one who has to
report this to the top!

19
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,670
That's my grandson for you!

20
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,500
Quiet, Garp!

21
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,530
You were assigned a special government
mission to eliminate them all,

22
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,340
yet you couldn't even bring back the
head of Luffy of the Straw Hats?

23
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,520
You're a disgrace!

24
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,560
Don't worry, Sengoku.

25
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,610
Luffy isn't the sort of man who'd go around
telling the world that he defeated Moria.

26
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,570
Kuma, you didn't take pity on those pirates
because they were injured, did you?

27
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,250
Even if you let them escape,
we will not stop pursuing them!

28
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,700
They're following the Log toward
the Navy Headquarters as we speak!

29
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,510
Oh, that's right!

30
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:53,980
Tea

31
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,000
I brought fresh tea leaves!

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,140
Bring some rice crackers!

33
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,570
Damn it, Garp, shut up!

34
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,990
"Halfway Across the Grand Line!
Arrival at the Red Line!"

35
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,990
What the heck is going on?

36
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,210
It's hopeless.

37
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,580
Oh, dear...

38
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,630
We're not catching a thing.

39
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,040
This is weird.

40
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,630
Times are tough...

41
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,330
Man, this is boring!

42
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,680
Now, let's be patient.

43
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,940
Hey, Nami!

44
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,080
Aren't we at Fishman Island yet? Huh? Huh?

45
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,700
Oh, give it a rest! I'm
sure we're getting close!

46
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,620
Fishman... Mermaids!

47
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,280
Oh, beautiful mermaid!

48
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,920
Where is the mermaid I have dreamed of?!

49
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,230
Gah! I'm sick of this!

50
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,350
Sanji! I need food!

51
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,270
Is that...

52
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,730
Incredible! A huge school of fish!

53
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,520
You see? With some patience,
everything works out!

54
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,780
Fish 'em all up!

55
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,570
They're coming this way!

56
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,990
Want to try it too, Nami?

57
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,420
What is it?

58
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,590
Something isn't right.

59
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,790
Huh?

60
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,260
Hey, wait up, fish!

61
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,870
That's...

62
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,520
This is...

63
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,520
What is that obviously
foreboding look on your face?

64
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,290
Serpent Currents!

65
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,570
Serpent Currents?

66
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,250
Everyone, be careful!

67
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,680
It's almost like they're alive...

68
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,600
This looks a little dicey.

69
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,440
Well, this is quite...

70
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,360
Cool!

71
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,550
Sanji-kun!

72
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,370
Leave it to me, Nami-san!

73
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,410
It won't budge!

74
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,220
Weapons...

75
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,220
Left!

76
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,900
Hey! What are you doing?!

77
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,170
Steer the ship!

78
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,950
Shut up!

79
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,620
In these waves, it won't
do what I tell it to!

80
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,200
Gum-Gum...

81
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,460
Pistol!

82
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,600
Are you all right?

83
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,040
Yeah! You saved us!

84
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,890
Serpent Currents...

85
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,450
They certainly do move like serpents.

86
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,630
They're very aptly named!

87
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,660
Hey, you! This is no time to be impressed!

88
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,870
Gum-Gum...

89
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,410
Gatling!

90
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,170
Star Shield!

91
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,350
We keep cutting them down,
but there's no end to them!

92
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,140
How long are these currents gonna last?!

93
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,310
How much farther do they go on?!

94
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,940
Should we fly out of here with Coup de Burst?

95
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,320
Oh, yeah! That's one way!

96
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,270
It won't work!

97
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,660
I can't see any end to the currents.

98
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,080
Even if we fly away with Coup de Burst...

99
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,710
We can't escape them.

100
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,840
What?! No way!

101
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,220
Shall I play a song?

102
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,600
Huh?

103
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,240
At times like these, we need to boost morale!

104
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,690
All storms and currents
will eventually recede.

105
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,100
Let's just be patient.

106
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,610
Sounds good, Brook! Go for it!

107
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,440
Then—

108
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,990
We're in the air!

109
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,570
Hey, we're...

110
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,080
...gonna fall!

111
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,540
Chopper!

112
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,510
I thought I was gonna die...

113
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,610
Hey, look!

114
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,150
That's...

115
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,450
I see it... I see it!

116
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,370
It's the Red Line!

117
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,670
The Red Line!

118
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,300
We finally made it this far!

119
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,090
There was a nasty storm that day, too...

120
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,310
I'm gonna find the All Blue!

121
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,180
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

122
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,970
I'm gonna be a great swordsman!

123
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm gonna make a map of the whole world!

124
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,910
I-I'm gonna become a
brave warrior of the sea!

125
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,830
Let's go!

126
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,800
To the Grand Line!

127
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,130
Hey! I can see the Mystery Mountain!

128
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,880
It's gigantic!

129
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,140
The entrance to the Grand Line...

130
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,240
So that's the Red Line!

131
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,390
I-I can't even see the top
through all the clouds!

132
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,080
It has taken me 50 years...

133
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,700
Let's go, everyone!

134
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,870
That's...

135
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,980
It's huge!

136
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,650
Make sure you steer.

137
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,500
I don't want you giving me orders.

138
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,350
Should we use the paddles to retreat?

139
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,640
There's no time.

140
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,120
Sanji-kun! Get us on that wave!

141
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,230
You got it!

142
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,900
Wait, "get us on" it?!

143
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,390
Leave it to me!

144
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,650
I dealt with bigger stuff than
this when I was on the Sky Island!

145
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,400
The Knock Up Stream, huh?

146
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,160
Yeah, that was really fun!

147
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,160
That wasn't fun at all!

148
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,870
Of course, there's no way
this time is gonna be...

149
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,910
Go!

150
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,930
Now we can use Coup de Burst!

151
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,470
Lower the sails, everyone!

152
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,940
Here we go!

153
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,560
Coup de Burst!

154
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,200
Whew, we're saved!

155
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,390
Man, that was a close one.

156
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,660
We're here!

157
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,900
We finally made it here!

158
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,400
I can't see the top...

159
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
It's huge!

160
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,980
So this is the Red Line...

161
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,490
It's kind of nostalgic... Makes
you feel really emotional, huh?

162
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,090
I wonder if we've grown
a little since then...

163
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,160
I feel like crying!

164
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,050
So much has happened!

165
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,630
Anyway, we're halfway there now!

166
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,820
The Twin Capes, where we met Laboon,

167
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,330
are connected to this wall on
the other side of the world.

168
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm glad we all made it here together!

169
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:27,440
Apparently, I crossed Reverse Mountain from
South Blue before I was old enough to remember,

170
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,780
but I guess that was more than 30 years ago.

171
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,660
I entered this sea five
years ago, from West Blue.

172
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,630
Once we go around the
second half of the world,

173
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,540
we'll get to see this wall
again, and when we do...

174
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,740
I'll be King of the Pirates!

175
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,900
We have to remain alert.

176
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,190
We're right next to Marie Jois,
the holy land of the Navy HQ

177
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,300
and the World Government.

178
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,790
This surprise pool is the best!

179
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,420
I'm not good enough...

180
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,590
Just try it.

181
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,040
Hey, you're alive?

182
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,530
Where is he?

183
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,030
What happened here?!

184
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,600
Nothing...

185
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,820
Nothing... happened!

186
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,390
I have to get stronger!

187
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,990
I'm still weak!

188
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,870
I'm still...!

189
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,480
How does it look, Robin? Brook? Luffy?

190
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,580
Not good. It's pitch dark.

191
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,620
It's pitch dark!

192
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,920
Hey, I just saw something flash!

193
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,050
Y-Y-You think it was some monster's eyes?!

194
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,220
M-Monster?!

195
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,550
W-We're gonna die!

196
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,840
Wait, I'm already dead!

197
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,400
Oh, right. Nami-san, pardon
me for asking, but...

198
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,450
What kind of panties are you wearing today?

199
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,210
Shut up! Be serious about this!

200
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,290
Scary!

201
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,250
He's got some guts.

202
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,780
Hey, you guys!

203
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,970
The Shark Submerge III can't
dive deeper than 5,000 meters!

204
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,430
Be careful!

205
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,230
Hm? The hull seems to be creaking...

206
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,190
Yes, because...

207
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,290
We're more than 5,000 meters under.

208
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,790
Ah, so that's why.

209
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,450
Wait! That's a bad idea!
The pressure will crush us!

210
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,110
Hey, that monster from
before is still around!

211
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,740
It sure has a big mouth!

212
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,100
That was close!

213
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,610
It's gonna eat us!

214
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,130
It's coming again!

215
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,720
Looks like this isn't gonna go well.

216
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,440
I never want to ride in the Shark Submerge.

217
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,430
Ditto.

218
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,890
Nami-san!

219
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,070
My tart made of horror pears
from Thriller Bark is done!

220
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,320
Wow, it looks delicious!

221
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,230
Behind us! Behind us!

222
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,370
Here it comes! We're gonna get eaten!

223
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,430
This is a problem, though...

224
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,500
Wow! This is great!

225
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,830
Yum!

226
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,960
Looks like another dead end,
just like at the Sky Island.

227
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,730
That's right.

228
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,310
I know which way we need to go, but
I don't know the means to get there.

229
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,310
How do we get to Fishman Island?

230
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,570
We're out!

231
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,910
That was fun!

232
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,490
Welcome back! Good job!

233
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,090
It was no good. We couldn't
see the sea floor.

234
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,480
You sure Fishman Island is really here?

235
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,500
That was my first time riding a submarine!

236
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,130
If it's any deeper, we'll
die before we get there.

237
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,590
I'm sure the Log Pose was
pointing right beneath us...

238
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,720
What a problem. I should have
talked with Lola about it more.

239
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,390
It's the thing from before!

240
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,190
It followed us back!

241
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,450
Don't think you can beat me
when we're above the water!

242
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,460
Gum-Gum Rifle!

243
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,860
It actually didn't seem all that huge.

244
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,540
Yeah, since we've seen Oars. We're okay now!

245
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,640
It spit something out.

246
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,560
Huh? A fish?

247
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,200
A person?!

248
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
No, it's not.

249
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,820
That's a...

250
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,160
It... It couldn't be!

251
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,590
Nailed it!

252
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,770
You saved me!

253
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,630
That was awesome!

254
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,170
You're not supposed to be impressed!

255
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,140
We were about to be digested!

256
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,510
You just had to stroll right
by that monster, didn't you?!

257
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,680
Well, I didn't see it there...

258
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,040
How do you miss something that huge?!

259
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,080
Hey, not that it matters, but
you're sitting on something.

260
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,820
Huh?

261
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,320
Gah! I crushed a human!

262
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,580
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

263
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,430
Oh, no, it's okay... More
importantly, are you...

264
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,140
Please snap out of it! Are you okay?

265
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,570
Is that...

266
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,830
...a tail fin?

267
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,130
No way... It's really...

268
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,680
A mermaid?!

269
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,690
Please save my friend, Hatchin!

270
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,670
Leave it to us!

271
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,850
We just have to knock out
that guy in the mask, right?

272
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,610
He's the boss of the Flying
Fish Riders, Duval!

273
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,480
I've been waiting.

274
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,140
I'll kill him.

275
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,640
I'll kill the man who ruined my life!

276
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

277
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,190
"Hatred for the Straw Hats!
Iron Mask Duval Appears!"

278
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,220
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
