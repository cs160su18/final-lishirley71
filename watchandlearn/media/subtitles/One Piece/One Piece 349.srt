2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,850
Perona-sama!

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,640
Moria-sama is summoning the Three Phantoms.

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,890
The master beckons? Whatever for?

50
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,060
I've heard that Straw Hat
Luffy has been captured!

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,070
He wants to make a show
out of reanimating No. 900!

52
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,570
Absalom!

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,740
What are you doing here? This is my room.

54
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,950
Welcome back, Perona-sama.

55
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,200
Zip it, Kumacy! How many times
must I tell you not to talk?!

56
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,030
I see you're as harsh on Kumacy as ever.

57
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,070
You're beary harsh.

58
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,670
More importantly, have you heard?
The master is summoning us.

59
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,510
They still haven't found us,
if you can believe that.

60
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,720
It's a miracle!

61
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Why did we hide here in the first place?

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,350
We didn't have much choice!

63
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,070
Who knew Beast Man was
gonna catch up so soon?

64
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,980
And I didn't realize this was a zombie!

65
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,310
Let's look for a chance to make
a break for it. Sound good?

66
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,940
Absalom-sama!

67
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,650
So this is where you went!
I have something that I'd like to tell you.

68
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,650
What is it?

69
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,200
It looks like we have one more
intruder on top of the pirates.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,620
An intruder?

71
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,700
It's the Humming Swordsman!

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,450
What?!

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Weapons Left!

74
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,180
Nico Robin!

75
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,060
They've never failed to catch
our prey, not even once!

76
00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:00,070
We hung out quietly in the ceiling
and snatched your friends up.

77
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,490
Now we'll take you to the same
place we took your friends!

78
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,450
Brace yourselves!

79
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,880
♪ Yo ho ho ho, yo ho ho ho... ♪

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,460
Who is it?! Who's singing that song?!

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,960
♪ Yo ho ho ho, yo ho ho ho ♪

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,510
Goodness, I see everyone really
did disembark onto this island.

83
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,040
How did you get up here?

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,140
I jumped.

85
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm light!

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,350
Seeing as you're here, I suppose
you've left me with no other choice.

87
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,890
I shall tell you everything
about this island.

88
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Hey! Who the hell are you?!

89
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,600
You aren't a zombie, are you?

90
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,030
I bet you're with these pirates!

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,010
Hey, Skeleton!

92
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,490
Yes, yes. Not to worry.

93
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,740
The fight is already over.

94
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,490
Huh?

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,170
Three-Pace Hum...

96
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,790
...Notch Slash!

97
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,550
"Luffy's Emergency Situation!
The Ultimate Shadow's Destination!"

98
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,940
The fight's not over!
Swords don't work on zombies!

99
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,150
He's gonna pop back up!

100
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,940
Curse you...!

101
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,950
Wait a sec...

102
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,280
I've seen you somewhere before!

103
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,630
Not to worry! I've already dealt with that.

104
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,840
How?

105
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,300
Even zombies have weaknesses!

106
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,770
What's that?!

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,730
It's the zombie's "soul."

108
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,570
His soul?! But I can see it leaving his body!

109
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,660
C-Captain!

110
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,240
It's high time you returned...

111
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,950
...to your rightful master!

112
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,680
Captain Tararan!

113
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,020
Captain! He took out the captain!

114
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,190
Captain!

115
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,320
He isn't budging an inch...

116
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,820
What did you do?!

117
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,610
I purified him.

118
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,450
You what?

119
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,370
Look! He's definitely the
"Humming Swordsman"!

120
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,420
Five years ago, he wreaked
havoc on Thriller Bark.

121
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,960
We've gotta tell the master!

122
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,040
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

123
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,220
That spider web is strong
against physical attacks,

124
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,760
but weak against fire.

125
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,390
What?

126
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,690
You're right! It melts right off!

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
They got Straw Hat and the others.

128
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,280
Y'know, you seem mighty
knowledgeable about this island...

129
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,700
I am, but I don't know where to begin.

130
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,620
If they've been caught,
we're probably too late.

131
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,080
What?! It's too late?!

132
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,920
P-Please don't yell at me!

133
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,800
It makes me jump under my skin!

134
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,720
But I'm a skeleton, so I don't have any skin!

135
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,730
It's my skull humor!

136
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,770
Don't bother. He's already dead.

137
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,960
Anyway, please put the
joking aside and hear me out.

138
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,360
Don't bother! He's already dead.

139
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,650
As I already told you,
without a working rudder,

140
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,580
I spent decades wandering these seas alone.

141
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,040
Even if I wanted to escape
from the Devil's Sea,

142
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,290
I was at the mercy of the tide
because of my broken rudder.

143
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,960
Now let's go back to about five years ago.

144
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,470
Much like you and your crewmates,
I was "invited" to Thriller Bark.

145
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,180
Desperate to leave the Florian Triangle,

146
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,900
I walked around this island in hopes

147
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,810
of finding the parts I
needed to fix my rudder.

148
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,980
I wonder if anything is down here... Nope.

149
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,860
What is that?! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!

150
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,780
Scary! Help me!

151
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,490
Freaky! I hate ghosts!

152
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,000
All I found were monsters and zombies.

153
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,960
In the end, they caught me and
brought me here to this building.

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,460
Inside, I saw...

155
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,130
...a martial arts dancer who
they caught before me...

156
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,390
...and a type of corpse covered
in stitches called a "mario."

157
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,270
A ghastly giant appeared before them!

158
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,430
It was incredible!

159
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,360
He peeled the man's shadow off the ground...

160
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,690
...and snip, snip!

161
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,780
He cut the man's shadow off?

162
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,530
I questioned my eyes!

163
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,240
Not

164
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,240
that I have any eyes.

165
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,830
You're asking for a knuckle sandwich!

166
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,250
Feel free to let him have it.

167
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,510
Shortly thereafter, I suffered the same fate.

168
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,180
The man who lost his shadow
collapsed on the spot.

169
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:15,250
His severed shadow was stuffed
into the inanimate mario.

170
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,480
Now what do you think happened?

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,780
The "mario" corpse got
up and started to move!

172
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,990
How's that work?

173
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,110
Shadows are our "second souls" that are
always with us, moving as we dictate.

174
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,290
That is true of your shadows as well.

175
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,670
Normally, these "souls" always stay with you,

176
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,270
following your every moment from
the moment you're born until you die.

177
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,720
There is a giant of a man who captures
them and makes them do his bidding!

178
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,020
He is one of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea, Gecko Moria!

179
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,230
He has eaten the Shadow-Shadow Fruit!

180
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,900
A Devil Fruit, huh?

181
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,470
Is he the one who stole your shadow?

182
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,410
A certain man stole my
shadow a few years ago.

183
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,780
Your shadow?

184
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,290
Does that sorta thing actually happen?

185
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,290
Yes, it does.

186
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,880
And having lost my shadow, I am no
longer able to exist in the world of light.

187
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,130
I cannot live under the light of the sun.

188
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,840
What would happen if you
were hit by the sunlight?

189
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,350
If I was directly hit by sunlight, my body...

190
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,850
...would be obliterated!

191
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,360
As long as he has a corpse, he can use
a shadow to turn it into a zombie.

192
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,660
The real problem is that his cohort
is the genius surgeon, Dr. Hogback.

193
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,290
He can reconstruct the body,
making it stronger than before!

194
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,000
Sometimes he uses his medical
expertise to revive the flesh

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
of legendary warriors from around the world.

196
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:06,970
And he has a tremendous collection of mario
currently preserved in his lab freezer.

197
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,220
Dr. Hogback...

198
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,600
I didn't realize the renowned
doctor has been here

199
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,360
assisting a pirate ever
since he went missing.

200
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,070
So those zombies are reanimated corpses,

201
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,240
but it's not like he actually
revived the dead, huh?

202
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,780
Exactly!

203
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,370
The shadow provides their
personality and fighting abilities.

204
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,730
The power of their body depends on
the physical ability of their mario.

205
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,920
If you combine a strong body
with a strong shadow,

206
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
it will create an even stronger zombie!

207
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,890
That is why Moria is eager to get
his hands on wanted men's shadows!

208
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,060
I getcha! No wonder he came after us.

209
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,240
So that's the deal with Thriller Bark.

210
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,690
Moria's favorite aspect about
zombies could be their obedience.

211
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,070
Generally, it's a challenge to
keep powerful warriors in line.

212
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,080
Right, but our shadows possess
the same abilities as us.

213
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,290
Once he has our shadows,
he can toss us troublemakers out.

214
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,670
The powerful are quickly returned to
the sea while they're still unconscious.

215
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,010
In that case, they're in trouble!

216
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,390
I wouldn't worry yet.

217
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,390
We still have time.

218
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,220
I will tell you the best way to handle this.

219
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,930
Please believe me and do as I instruct.

220
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,640
What?! You want us to believe you?!

221
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,320
Good sir, I'm shocked to the skull!

222
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,320
Actually, I haven't bickered like
this in decades, so I'm eating it up!

223
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,620
We'll hear you out, so get talking!

224
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,540
Certainly!

225
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,960
Master!

226
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,760
Moria-sama!

227
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,010
The Three Phantoms have gathered together!

228
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,970
That was quick! Enter!

229
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,660
Please come in.

230
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,650
Oh, you're here!

231
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Turn me into the King of the Pirates!

232
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,430
We're on it!

233
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,830
You can't become the King of the Pirates!

234
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,330
The future King of the Pirates...

235
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,320
...is me!

236
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,770
Hey! Untie this rope, you oversized shallot!

237
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,780
Give Usopp, Nami, Chopper,
Sanji, and Zoro back!

238
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,110
Where'd you hide them, shallot head?!

239
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,780
This one has lot of fight in him.

240
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,030
So this is Straw Hat Luffy, eh?

241
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,490
I have a hard time believing this is the man

242
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,540
who picked a fight with the World Government.

243
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,710
Why is he wearing General Zombie armor?

244
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,210
Don't you get it? This is every guy's dream!

245
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,800
You got captured, so don't
lecture me about dreams!

246
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,720
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy! You've made
a pretty big name for yourself,

247
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,180
but you're only our third catch so far.

248
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:46,480
We've got Pirate Hunter Zoro and some
blond guy who didn't have a wanted poster.

249
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,070
Huh? Sanji's the only blond in my crew...

250
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,700
What?! Hey, it sounds like
they caught Zoro and Sanji.

251
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,580
No way! And they even have Luffy.

252
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,690
Wh-Why did the three monsters
have to be the first to get caught?

253
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,510
I have no idea who these guys are,
but they're definitely bad news!

254
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,830
By the way, what happened
to that trio, Perona?

255
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,760
I recall handing them over
to the Risky Brothers.

256
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,980
But Kumacy never got them.

257
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,400
You sure they didn't
escape on their way over?

258
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,270
Bingo!

259
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,230
They're talking about us.

260
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,270
The casket popped open!

261
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,240
Huh?

262
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,100
Jerks!

263
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,460
Usopp! Nami!

264
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,060
Hey, hang in there! Wake up!

265
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,680
Shush! Dude, don't say a thing!

266
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,140
--Actually--
--I keep telling you to keep that mouth shut!

267
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,680
You're too harsh on Kumacy.
You're beary harsh.

268
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,850
But the trio that includes my bride caused

269
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,910
quite the commotion in your courtyard.

270
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,450
Hey, wait a second...

271
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,320
Now that I think about
it... Hogback, you pig!

272
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,540
This means you've raised your
hand against my future bride!

273
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,330
I warned you not to touch her!

274
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,870
You'll never get married.

275
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,900
Say what?! Cindry!

276
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,510
Now, now, Cindry-chan!
You're only adding fuel to the fire!

277
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,470
And why are you standing in front of me?

278
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,590
You won't get married, either.

279
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,930
You're killing me! That
was a nasty stray bullet!

280
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,020
What are they going to do with
Luffy now that they've caught him?

281
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,690
And what's happened to Sanji and Zoro?

282
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,860
We're in pretty deep doo-doo ourselves!

283
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,200
But there is no way Luffy's
gonna stay in that cage!

284
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,670
What?!

285
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,880
Jerk!

286
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,410
Good, good! Keep nice and quiet.

287
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,380
No matter what anyone says,
my mind is made up!

288
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,920
That woman will be my blushing bride!

289
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,390
You will never get married.

290
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,010
Shut up!

291
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,070
Come on, Cindry-chan!
Why don't you just ignore Absalom?

292
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,680
Don't expect to get married... ever!

293
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,140
That's two stray bullets in a row!

294
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,230
She said I'll never get married!

295
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,230
Cut it out! Knock it off!

296
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
I can't stand all your fussing!

297
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,190
If those pirates got away,
you can deal with it later!

298
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,570
I had you gather so we could celebrate

299
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,180
the commemorative creation
of a powerful ally!

300
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,960
He's insane!

301
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,590
Master, the pirate chewed
through the cage and is escaping!

302
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,050
He chewed...

303
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,760
...through the cage?!

304
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,060
Why did you capture me?!

305
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
--Luffy!
--Sweet!

306
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,480
He's going to prove dependable!

307
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,650
Don't, Absalom! We're indoors.

308
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,940
I'll stop him.

309
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,950
You can't catch me, dummy!

310
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,480
Negative Hollow!

311
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,950
Those are...!

312
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,830
Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!...

313
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,550
They're multiplying as they dance! Awesome!

314
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,470
I'll catch them and keep them as pets!

315
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,800
Fresh Fire!

316
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,590
Shoot! It didn't work.

317
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,310
That was an epic fail.
I'm such a loser this week.

318
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,480
I can hear the whole world booing me!

319
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,670
Okay! I've got the punk!

320
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,150
If I could be reborn, I'd like to be a clam.

321
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
I suck!

322
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,080
That won't work on me a second time!

323
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,370
If I could be reborn,
I'd like to be a sea cucumber...

324
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,310
Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!

325
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,280
To fall from the King of the
Pirates to a sea cucumber...

326
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,980
Brutal!

327
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,950
Damn it! Let go of me!

328
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,200
Hit him with the light!

329
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,240
What the heck are you doing?!

330
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,640
Jerk, I'll get you for this!

331
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,150
What is that?! My shadow?

332
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,820
Hey, don't do it!

333
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,440
I've obtained 300 million
Berries' worth of might!

334
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,240
Now I can complete the greatest
Special Zombie in history!

335
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,550
Luffy!

336
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,130
This is the moment of the
century, Cindry-chan!

337
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,340
When I saw his corpse in the Land of Ice,
my body wouldn't stop trembling.

338
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,800
Cindry-chan, that's my line!

339
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,470
I was so close to the famous giant known
as the legendary "Continent Puller."

340
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,600
That's mine, too!

341
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,850
I'm gonna be King of the--

342
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,850
That's a far cry from your line!

343
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

344
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,230
"The Warrior Known as the 'Devil'!!
The Moment of Oars' Revival!"

345
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
