The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

We are the one! Go ahead!

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920

Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,430
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,010
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,050
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

73
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,750
and have come to Dressrosa

74
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,100
but Law has been captured by Doflamingo.

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,200
Luffy snuck into the Royal Palace
to take back Law.

76
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,440
Hey Sugar, what are you doing?!

77
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,390
Keep your senses!

78
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,750
Meanwhile, Usopp knocked Sugar out

79
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,870
and freed the toys who had been
forced to labor as slaves.

80
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,510
Mingo's dead!

81
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,500
Disgusting!

82
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
Ow, it's hot!
I really can generate a fire!

83
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,340
Ace!

84
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,060
I take over your ability!

85
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,820
You are...

86
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,220
Fire Fist!

87
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,200
"Dashing onto the Scene!
The Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Army, Sabo!"

88
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,060
The ring is disappearing.

89
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,990
Who are you?

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,290
I got in touch with Hack.
Let's meet up with him!

91
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,840
All right.

92
00:05:50,980 --> 00:06:02,640
God Usopp! God Usopp! God Usopp!...

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,860
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

94
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,350
Usoland! Usoland!

95
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,520
Guide us, God Usopp!
What are we supposed to do?!

96
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,980
Then, why don't you destroy
the factory behind me

97
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,070
and rescue our little friends?

98
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,620
Be careful!

99
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,580
Devil Fruit eaters are
weakened by touching water.

100
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,270
Oh yeah.

101
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,550
God Usopp gave us guidance!
Destroy the factory!

102
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,580
"Destroy the factory"?!

103
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,620
I won't let you do such a thing!

104
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,240
God Usopp. Leave the rest to us.

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,910
More importantly... I want you to...

106
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,660
...put me down.

107
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,830
This way!

108
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,870
Sorry!

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,970
That's...

110
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,950
Shit!

111
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,520
That guy was not Straw Hat!

112
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,580
How dare he eat the Flare-Flare Fruit
that was supposed to be mine!

113
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,030
Damn!
How can I tell Doffy about this situation?

114
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,220
Who are those bastards?!

115
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,690
--Look! He's a Doflamingo operative!
--Thank you for turning us into toys!

116
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,400
Take him down together with the factory!

117
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,970
I see! They were the toys underground!

118
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,230
Here! I'm here!

119
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,330
Hack!

120
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,760
Feels like I haven't seen
you for a long time.

121
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,970
It's strange.

122
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,840
Oh?

123
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,370
What happened to your hand?

124
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,610
This is...

125
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,550
I just fell down!

126
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,060
Fell down? You? Really?

127
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,990
Wh-Why would I have to tell a lie?

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,940
I can't believe there was a
space like this underground!

129
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,790
--Oh yeah! Here are your clothes.
--Thanks.

130
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,690
Bloody hell!

131
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,530
It caught fire! This is hard to control!

132
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,220
--Excuse me...
--Hey!

133
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,520
How could you leave me behind like that,
my great senpai!

134
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,540
Yes, I'm a man and
I can create barriers but...

135
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,390
That guy is...

136
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,350
Who are you really?

137
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,340
Me?

138
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,490
My name is Sabo.

139
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,470
KOALA - THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
SABO - THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
HACK - THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY

140
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,810
We're members of the Revolutionary Army.

141
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,680
The Revolutionary Army?!

142
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,450
What? Then, the first Lucy, too?!

143
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,810
The first Lucy has a bounty of 400 million.

144
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,780
He's the man who'll become
the King of the Pirates someday!

145
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,460
Straw Hat Luffy!

146
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,390
A pirate?!

147
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,530
Yeah, he's my brother. Take good care of him!

148
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,540
--Wh-What?!
--Yep, yep!

149
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,590
Luffy is a nice guy, isn't he?

150
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,090
You guys! Are you gonna become pirates?!

151
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,530
I'm gonna become one, too!

152
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,080
He hasn't changed a bit.

153
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,450
Well, let's just leave
it until the time comes.

154
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,810
Maybe we'll set out independently.

155
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,940
Oh, you stole that from Dadan!

156
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,230
Did you guys know?!

157
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,710
We can become brothers
if we exchange this cup of sake!

158
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,320
Brothers? Really?!

159
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,120
When we become pirates,
we might not be on the same ship

160
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,420
but our brotherhood will always be with us!

161
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,190
Wherever you are, whatever you do,
we'll always be bonded together!

162
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,820
So from now on,

163
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,760
we're brothers!

164
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,090
Yeah!!

165
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,870
He's still reckless and everything.

166
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,880
Sabo-kun, you do very reckless things, too!

167
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,150
Do I?

168
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,670
Well, I think it through before I let loose.

169
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,600
What do you mean?

170
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,240
Luffy, however, merely follows his instincts.

171
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,310
What's the difference?

172
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,310
But what brought you Revolutionaries
here to this country?

173
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,800
Those are...

174
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,390
These weapons that they export from this port
aggravate wars around the world.

175
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,510
We're here to...

176
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,200
...stop it!

177
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,510
The Revolutionary Army has sent soldiers
to this country many times

178
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,150
but because they all got turned into toys,

179
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,450
we couldn't find out about this black market.

180
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,870
Hey, that guy's troublesome!

181
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,880
Yeah, that's Sabo, isn't it?!

182
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,450
What is the number 2 of the
Revolutionary Army doing here?!

183
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,550
Gotta tell the Young Master!

184
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,540
But I guess they're manufacturing
weapons somewhere else.

185
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,830
Where do they come from?

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,550
If we can find that out,

187
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,510
Dragon-san will be pleased.

188
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,060
Things are getting messier!

189
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,830
Issho-san, what should we do?!

190
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,120
Son of a bitch!

191
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,180
THE KING'S PLATEAU - IN
FRONT OF THE RAMPART TOWER

192
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,140
Quite a ruckus.
I guess something is going on down there.

193
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,430
Anyway, where did he go?

194
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,210
The stone man!

195
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,600
What?!

196
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,770
Doflamingo!

197
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,790
Hey, sorry! Let me through!

198
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,920
You jerk!

199
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,880
What the...

200
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,160
How dare you turn us into toys!

201
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,220
Now I'm gonna get my revenge!
Prepare to die, Doflamingo!

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,620
Doflamingo's gone!

203
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,490
No way! It's impossible!

204
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,130
Dammit! Where did he go?! Doflamingo!

205
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,510
I bet he hasn't made it that far yet!
Look for him!

206
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,360
That was close.

207
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,020
I thought this was Doflamingo's stronghold.
Why was I targeted?

208
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,940
Could it be...?!

209
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,660
The toys must've turned back to their original forms!
They accomplished Operation SOP!

210
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,780
--What?! They pulled it off?!
--Yeah, yeah! They did it, they did it!

211
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,660
--That's great!
--They did it!

212
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,920
You'd better turn back to yourself
or you'll be targeted again!

213
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,540
Oh! You're right!

214
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,980
Poof!

215
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,450
Kanjuro! I'm coming to save you!

216
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,540
Koala!

217
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,570
Robin-san!

218
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,720
I thought it was you! How've you been?!

219
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,820
Great!

220
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,430
Sabo! Hack!
You all haven't changed a bit!

221
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,670
Yo!

222
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,810
Ro... R-R-R-R-R... Robin senpai?!

223
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,020
Did you see Luffy?

224
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,990
Uh-huh.

225
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,270
Oh! The guy from earlier!

226
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,210
He's one of our crew! He's Usopp!

227
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,560
H-Hi'm Ohahho (I'm Usopp).

228
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,860
He can stay down.

229
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,350
Usopp?! One of their crew?

230
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,230
No, no, no, no!

231
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,370
I didn't see such a name
on their wanted posters!

232
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,380
D-D-Don't tell me he is...!

233
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,960
What is wrong with you?

234
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,040
THE ROYAL PALACE

235
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,230
You bastard!

236
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,190
How dare you kill the Young Master!

237
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,000
Prepare to be blown away!

238
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,160
Dasu...!

239
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,180
Buffalo!

240
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,970
You asshole!

241
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,860
Damn!

242
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,220
Tra-guy!

243
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,240
I'm here to save you!

244
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,290
Straw Hat?!

245
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,100
I'm glad that you're alive!

246
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,350
You have no business here, Straw Hat!

247
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,700
What about the factory?!
Did you destroy it?!

248
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,890
Here's the key to his handcuffs!

249
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,070
You have everything prepared!

250
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,930
Wait, Straw Hat! Violet!

251
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,610
You can't lay a finger on the Young Master...

252
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,100
Young Master?

253
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,440
What... happened?

254
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,260
King Riku-sama! Sorry to keep you waiting!

255
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,670
Give me a minute! I'm gonna rescue you!

256
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,390
Thanks, but the alliance
between me and you guys is over!

257
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,670
Get out of here!

258
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,070
Huh?! How selfish!

259
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,940
I'll make those decisions,
not you, so shut your mouth!

260
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,930
That makes you more selfish than me!

261
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,170
Unlock it!

262
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,400
Oh yeah.

263
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,540
If there's no alliance,
we're not on the same side!

264
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,280
If you set me free, I'll kill you!

265
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,330
Stop moving!

266
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,920
It's hard to unlock it
since I can't touch Sea Prism Stone!

267
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,020
You can do it!

268
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,670
You two are not listening to me!

269
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,010
I can't!

270
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,920
Why don't you do it?!

271
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,380
I can't! I'm a Devil Fruit eater, too!

272
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,420
Oh, the stone guy!

273
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,070
Pica!

274
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,480
I never thought I'd be taken in like this.

275
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,220
Mingo's alive!

276
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,150
--Young Master-sama!
--Young Master!

277
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,990
How could he still be alive?!

278
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,560
The whole country is thrown into chaos
after the toys have been freed.

279
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:44,270
And for whatever reason,
the Revolutionary Army is here secretly, too.

280
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,550
And the Royal Palace is a mess.

281
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,950
It's a difficult situation.

282
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,960
I have no choice but to use the "Birdcage."

283
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,280
The Birdcage?!

284
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,970
Right, Law?

285
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,440
Luffy lands in a fight with
Doflamingo, risen from the dead!

286
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,910
In the heat of the fierce battle,
the worst extermination plan in the history begins,

287
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,620
meant to hide the true history of the country
and plunge the island into terror!

288
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,650
On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Devil's Trap! A Dressrosa Extermination Plan!"

289
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
