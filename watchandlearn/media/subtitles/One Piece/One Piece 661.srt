The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,390

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42

Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,500
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,720
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,710
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,940
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,060
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,960
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,160
Luffy entered a fighting competition -

77
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,470
in which a winner will get the
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize -

78
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,570
and won the first round.

79
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,330
Meanwhile, Usopp and the others

80
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,030
learned about the nightmare
in Dressrosa a decade ago...

81
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,490
...from a toy soldier who is looking to
take down Doflamingo.

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,320
Please stop!

83
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,610
If there's no preventing me
hurting the citizens...

84
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,330
Somebody, please kill me!

85
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,960
We're here to save this country!

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,610
My name is Don Quixote Doflamingo!

87
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,510
The country fell into the hands
of Doflamingo in just one night.

88
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,270
We believed that King Riku went crazy
at that time, too,

89
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,690
so we got in touch with the new king Doflamingo
and ended up like this.

90
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,630
I'm so ashamed of myself
for distrusting King Riku!

91
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,780
I see! It's really too bad!

92
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,560
You let the innocent king that you
all admired so much die for nothing.

93
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,220
No, he's still alive!

94
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,040
There were soldiers who got killed
and who surrendered.

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,710
But when you sum it up,

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,680
it doesn't add up to a
whole army for a country!

97
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,060
In addition, they must've been feeling angry

98
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,090
since Doflamingo turned them into toys.

99
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,130
That unknown number of those poor people
is the key to our plan!

100
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,540
"A Showdown Between the Warlords!
Law vs. Doflamingo!"

101
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,410
Hey! I'm here!

102
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,150
--Zoro! Kin'emon!
--Luffy!

103
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,210
Don't shout, idiot!
Somebody's gonna find us!

104
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,460
--Shh! Shh! Please!
--Oh, sorry!

105
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,940
But I'm glad to see you!

106
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,470
I wasn't so sure about that man
who talks so weirdly

107
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,260
but it seems like
he did what he had to do.

108
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,710
Where is he?

109
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,160
He collapsed on our way here.

110
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,960
Really? What is wrong with that guy?

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,270
I don't know.

112
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,070
There you are.

113
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,110
Straw Hat!

114
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,040
Joker wants me to kill Straw Hat?

115
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,990
Finish it up before the competition's over.

116
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,860
Then, you'll get promoted to be...

117
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,720
...an executive of the Family.

118
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,190
I'm sorry, Straw Hat. But I...

119
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,400
I wanna get on board Doflamingo's ship!

120
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,440
Hey, Bellamy! Don't give up!

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm not holding a grudge
against you anymore.

122
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,850
I'm done picking on you.

123
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,280
Yeah, and then
he suddenly collapsed...

124
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,730
Hey, Luffy. What's wrong?

125
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,820
Nothing.

126
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,510
Then, I got lost.
I didn't know which way to go, so...

127
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,050
Ah! There you are, Bellamy!

128
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,490
Hey, have you killed him already?

129
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,620
You haven't, have you?!

130
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,960
What do you want, Dellinger?!

131
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,980
DELLINGER - A COMBATANT
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY (THE DIAMANTE ARMY)

132
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,980
Well, I thought you were gonna mess it up.

133
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,970
The assassination of Straw Hat.

134
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,570
What?!

135
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,630
Well, what can you do?
He's a strong guy.

136
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,900
But it doesn't matter
if you can get it done or not.

137
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,410
What do you mean?

138
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,330
I mean he wasn't that serious
about the assassination.

139
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,120
He doesn't want you to follow him about

140
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,260
so he told me to finish you off here.

141
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,630
That's Young Master-sama's order.

142
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,230
No way...

143
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,700
I shouldn't have told you that!

144
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,810
Oh no! Sorry!

145
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,890
You've got to be kidding!

146
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,690
No more...

147
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,940
...chitchatting.

148
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,220
Prepare to die!

149
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,210
ON THE IRON BRIDGE CLOSE TO DRESSROSA

150
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,680
Room!

151
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,900
What's the matter, Law?

152
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,770
I thought that you wanted to kill me!

153
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,890
Room!

154
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,910
Takt!

155
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,430
Scalpel!

156
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,280
Law, that fool!
He looks exhausted!

157
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,050
You can't get away from me, brat!

158
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,420
Room!

159
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,590
Shambles!

160
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,190
What the hell?!

161
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,670
The power of the Op-Op Fruit, huh?
How annoying.

162
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,340
But if I'm correct,
your power has a limit, doesn't it?

163
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,230
You've dealt with the meteorite that Fujitora

164
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,310
brought down and fought me once
and then rescued Black Foot.

165
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,350
I wonder how much longer it'll last.

166
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,870
Bullet String!

167
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,190
Room!

168
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,590
Room!

169
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,480
What are you gonna do now, Law?

170
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,490
Dressrosa is right there.

171
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,090
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

172
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,190
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

173
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,140
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

174
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,300
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

175
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,340
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

176
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,440
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

177
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,340
Ring, ring, ring...

178
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,190
Ring, ring, ring... Clank.

179
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,430
Hey, Doffy.

180
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,860
Diamante.

181
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, sorry.
Are you in the middle of something?

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,770
No, it's okay. Go on.

183
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,280
Violet betrayed us.

184
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,390
Black Foot was here
so I thought something was wrong.

185
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,790
We were gonna find out what the

186
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,190
Straw Hats were up to
with her Glare-Glare Fruit power

187
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,300
but we still don't know.

188
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,280
Oh, don't worry about it.

189
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,130
Diamante.

190
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,930
Deploy Lao G. and others
at the entrance to the SMILE factory.

191
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,900
Whoa-whoa, no way!

192
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,920
They have to fight in the finals
and make the people happy.

193
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,410
I'm sure you can handle it
by yourself.

194
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,880
Stop! You make it sound like
I'm some kind of genius.

195
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,740
Only you can do it.

196
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,200
Like I said, you make it sound like I'm...

197
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,450
Admit it. You are a genius.

198
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,690
Okay, I'll do it if you insist!

199
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,560
Clank!

200
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,600
Doflamingo... You bastard!

201
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,700
Law.

202
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,240
While you're drawing my attention as a decoy,

203
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,200
other members of the Straw Hats
are planning to destroy the factory.

204
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,140
Even if you die here,
as long as the factory is destroyed,

205
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Kaido will kill me once
I lose all the SMILEs.

206
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,880
Isn't it how your little scenario goes?

207
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:58,720
But you can't buy time as you'd hoped
and the Straw Hats aren't doing so well.

208
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,350
You said you were just using them

209
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,290
but if you didn't trust them,
you couldn't plan something like that.

210
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,770
How can you trust...

211
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,480
...Straw Hat so much?!

212
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,750
Because I know
the "D" will blow up a storm again!

213
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,820
And what do you want, Zoro?

214
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,620
You fool! Why didn't you tell me
there was this kinda competition?!

215
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,460
Sorry, sorry!

216
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,770
You were having fun while I
was running around the town!

217
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,540
Hey, that's not what we're here for!

218
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,240
How could you let that old man beat you?!
What were you doing?!

219
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,050
I didn't get beaten!

220
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,550
--Didn't you see my Gum-Gum Thor Elephant Gun?!
--That's... No mistake!

221
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,150
Vice Admiral Bastille!

222
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,610
That was the "Pirate Hunter" as I thought!

223
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,360
And the guy in the Colosseum is...

224
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,830
...probably Straw Hat Luffy!

225
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,320
"SHARK SLICER" BASTILLE - A NAVY VICE ADMIRAL

226
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,330
So he was the winner of Block C, huh? Lucy?

227
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,090
No wonder he was so strong-dara.

228
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,770
As Smoker said, they are in this country.

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,220
Should we catch them?

230
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,330
No, leave them at large for now.

231
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,010
There are a bunch of

232
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,120
infamous pirates, highly-skilled
bounty hunters and mercenaries...

233
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,020
...from the New World
gathered in the Colosseum now-dara.

234
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,110
If we try to catch the Straw Hats
and make a scene,

235
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,490
they'll know that we're here-dara.

236
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,650
We're gonna catch every one of these badasses

237
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,950
as they come out of the Colosseum.

238
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,020
We wanna catch them
in one fell swoop-dara.

239
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,600
The ones that already got eliminated are
Don Chin Jao from Block C and...

240
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,570
Sai? Boo? Abdullah?

241
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,500
Why did I write down these names
that I don't even know?

242
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,790
Do you know any of these pirates?

243
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,720
What the hell are you talking about-dara?!

244
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,310
They've messed around the New World!
They're very troublesome...

245
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,630
What were those names again-dara?

246
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,440
Oh, yes. Sai, Boo, and Abdullah.

247
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,400
--Sai? Boo?
--Abdullah?

248
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,440
Who are they?

249
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,480
I've never heard those names-dara.

250
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,240
Oh? Who were we here to catch?

251
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,700
Huh?!

252
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,700
Ring, ring, ring...

253
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,390
Is this how you use it?

254
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,630
What are you doing?

255
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,800
Sanji-dono told me to call
once we see Luffy-dono.

256
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,440
Yeah?

257
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,130
Oh yeah, Luffy!

258
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,180
The Colosseum has been besieged
by the Navy.

259
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,740
You don't care?!
That was what we came here for!

260
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,160
OFF THE COAST OF DRESSROSA

261
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,550
Ring, ring, ring...

262
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,930
Sanji! The Snail is ringing!

263
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,180
Must be Kin'emon.

264
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,300
--Really?! I'm gonna get it then!
--Oh no, you can't!

265
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,760
This is the Sunny.

266
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,420
Sanji? It's me!

267
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,470
Luffy!

268
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,340
Alright, Chopper. Call
Usopp with the other one.

269
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,090
Okay!

270
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,270
There!

271
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,040
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

272
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,460
--Clank.
--This is Usopp!

273
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,950
Connected!

274
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, now we have everybody
except Law on the line.

275
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,740
This is Sanji on the Sunny.

276
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,590
We have Nami-san, Chopper, Brook,
Momonosuke, and Caesar here.

277
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,500
Tell me your situation.

278
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,580
This is Kin'emon.

279
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,080
I'm in front of the Colosseum
with Luffy-dono and Zoro-dono.

280
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,750
Okay. What about you, Usopp?

281
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,860
This is Uso...

282
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,390
--This is Franky! I'm with Usopp and Robin!
--What are you doing?!

283
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,740
Listen, guys.
We are currently with...

284
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,400
...the King Riku Army, an anti-Doflamingo
coalition in this country.

285
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,240
--An army?
--Of Little People.

286
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Little People?

287
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,710
Usoland, what are you doing?

288
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,940
This is a meeting for heroes only.
Don't listen!

289
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,030
Yes, sir!

290
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,610
Excuse us!

291
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,080
Hey, Luffy, do you remember?

292
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,160
We met the strange toy soldier
outside of the Colosseum.

293
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,120
Uh-huh. Who are the Little People?

294
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,630
He was actually
the commander of this army.

295
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,030
Oh! The commander of the Little People?!

296
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,820
And all the people here are looking to...

297
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,400
...take down Doflamingo this very day!

298
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,270
Huh? A soldier?

299
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,240
He is willing to sacrifice his life
to destroy this kingdom!

300
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,270
Oh, that's it! The "Toy Soldier"!

301
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,850
Rebecca wants to stop him!

302
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,020
--Franky, stop the army!
--No way!

303
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,640
I was thinking the exact opposite!

304
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,340
Have you talked to that girl Rebecca?!

305
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,030
Uh-huh! She is a really nice girl!

306
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,030
She didn't have much money
but she bought me three lunch boxes!

307
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,290
Despite that, once she entered in the ring,
the audience jeered at her!

308
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,040
I couldn't agree more.

309
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,810
Luffy, I...

310
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,550
I can't follow Tra-guy's plan!

311
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,920
What're you saying, Franky?!

312
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,640
This is how I remember his plan.

313
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,910
After destroying the SMILE factory,

314
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,530
we'll keep Doflamingo alive and
use him to take down Kaido.

315
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,360
But then,

316
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,650
what's gonna happen to these people

317
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,630
who're looking to bring
down Doflamingo today?!

318
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,310
We can't stop these Little People.

319
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:24,010
It seems like everybody's happy at first
but this country has a very dark side.

320
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,910
They're...

321
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,220
...getting ready to fight a deadly battle
to get rid of that dark side!

322
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,350
They're pretty small
but they have big balls!

323
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,200
This brave, little army is going to challenge

324
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,090
their filthy, monstrous enemy!

325
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,450
I can't...

326
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,270
...let them down!

327
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,540
Do you still think it's better for us
if Doflamingo wins the battle?!

328
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,990
Luffy!

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,410
No matter what you say...

330
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,490
I'm gonna fight with them!

331
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,160
Franky...

332
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,790
Soldier-san's gonna die.

333
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,990
Franky!

334
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,400
You're free to go all out!

335
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,410
We'll be there as soon as possible!

336
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,860
Thanks!

337
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,190
All right.

338
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,600
Let's go back!

339
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,190
What?!

340
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,780
I thought you were gonna say that!

341
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,650
What's that?!

342
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,720
What's happening there?!

343
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,560
Issho-san, there is a big fight in the town!

344
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,890
We gotta hurry!

345
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,770
What's that? I heard something
loud from your side!

346
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,260
--What's going on?! The town is...
--It's coming this way!

347
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,430
What the hell?! I can't see a thing!
What's going on?!

348
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,700
What the...

349
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,500
Vice Admiral Bastille! Is that...

350
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,290
Let's go-dara!

351
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,850
What's going on here-dara?

352
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,430
Doflamingo!

353
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,930
Tra-guy!

354
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,690
Stupid brat!

355
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,290
Hey, Tra-guy! Why are you with Doflamingo...

356
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,810
You've pushed it too far!

357
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Cora-san...

358
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,970
Tra-guy!!
