00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,910
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,770
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,280
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,350
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,360
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,060
"I've decided to head to Elbaf!"

35
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,550
"What?! Please don't go!"

36
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,520
"I was just kidding. I know how you guys feel."

37
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,040
"So you're coming back, Usopp?!"

38
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,650
"Of course I am, silly!

39
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,990
Geez, you guys must like me so much!"

40
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,090
What the hell is that idiot doing?

41
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,290
Whoa!

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,350
"Everyone Finally Has A Bounty!
A Pirate Group Worth Over 600 Million!"

43
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,610
Yokozuna! I need lumber! Hurry up!

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,730
Ribbit, ribbit!

45
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,840
Bring me some, too!

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,640
Ribbit, ribbit!

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,560
Seriously, those two are extraordinary.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,610
Just as you'd expect from Tom's Workers!

49
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,700
Yeah, we're barely keeping up with them.

50
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,790
It boggles the mind that they
could work at such a crazy pace.

51
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,110
And there isn't even the
slightest fault in their work.

52
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,270
We're not gonna get anywhere by
just sitting here and admiring them.

53
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,740
Let's show them what us
Dock #1 workers are made of!

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,340
Yeah!

55
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,800
Yokozuna! Guys! Keep it up!

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,400
What's funny?

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,960
Well...

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,140
I just remembered you used to collect junk

59
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,950
and built a bunch of weird
battleships on this scrap heap island.

60
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,460
You didn't like me building weapons, did you...?

61
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,790
Right. On top of that, they were
used to frame Tom-san as a criminal.

62
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,960
But by looking at this, I can tell...

63
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,250
...that your experience building those
battleships wasn't a waste at all.

64
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,760
Ha! Is that sarcasm?

65
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,730
I wanted to show Tom-san that
the Moron-ky from back then has...

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,760
With this ship, going to the New
World is no longer a pipe dream.

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,860
Even before Tom-san...

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,650
...you can resolutely stand proud!

69
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,470
Iceberg...

70
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,130
I never thought those two would
work together to build a ship.

71
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,490
Ow!

72
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,350
Well...! What the hell are you doing
instead of helping me with work?!

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,420
To think that you keep making
unstable stuff like this!

74
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,090
Shut up! It's none of
your business, Stupid-berg!

75
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,050
Seriously, what's with him?!
You should just kick out an idiot like him!

76
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,230
Well, don't say that. He's a fellow ship builder.

77
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,570
His shipbuilding skills are already almost
on par with the craftsmen on the island...

78
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,770
...though what he makes is shaky.

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,310
He's just always honest, that's all.

80
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,980
You two will definitely become
world-class shipbuilding engineers someday.

81
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,780
You should be nice to each other.

82
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,810
The way things are going,

83
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,780
it looks like we'll be able to
finish it sooner than we planned.

84
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,250
Iceberg, let me tell you one thing.
This isn't just another pirate ship.

85
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,650
I know. You've put your heart into--

86
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,150
That's not what I'm saying.

87
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,640
The Straw Hats went head-on

88
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,650
against not only Navy Headquarters,
but the World Government.

89
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,180
This is the ship they'll be traveling on.

90
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,470
And you, the mayor of Water Seven,
took part in building it.

91
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,190
If that becomes known, you could be in trouble.

92
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,150
You do understand that, don't you?

93
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,840
Well...

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,860
I'll think about it when the time comes.

95
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,320
Besides, did you forget what Tom-san said?

96
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,200
Franky, there's no such thing
as blueprints for a pirate ship.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,350
If the sailors who board a ship put up
a skull flag, then it's a pirate ship.

98
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,670
If they put up a seagull flag,
then it's a Navy ship.

99
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,010
I don't care what you wanna build,

100
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,800
but a man should be resolutely
proud of the ship he built!

101
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,750
So I...

102
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,510
No, Galley-La has been building ships
based on that creed all this time.

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
But to think that...

104
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,660
...I'm giving you a hand
towards achieving your dream...

105
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,910
Even I feel that... I'm not in my right mind.

106
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,200
It's not like I asked you to
give me a hand, Stupid-berg.

107
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,500
You abandoned your real name

108
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,800
and your body, too, is like that
of a completely different man.

109
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,270
But you haven't changed at all.
You're just the way you used to be.

110
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,100
My dream... Huh...

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,970
Give Tom-san back to us!

112
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,540
Stop! Sea train!

113
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,190
Tom-san...

114
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,150
I don't wanna build ships anymore!

115
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,990
I can't love ships that hurt
the people I really care about!

116
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,910
But, Tom-san...

117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,540
...you're my goal after all!

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,840
So I want you to come back
and teach me again...

119
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,060
...because I want to...

120
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,900
...build a dream ship someday, too.

121
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,720
A ship that resolutely and proudly traverses

122
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,610
even uncharted waves at edges of the earth!

123
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,910
A dream ship like that!

124
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,980
This bites... My body... is on fire.

125
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,380
So I'm still alive.

126
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,220
But I wonder if I'll die like this...

127
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,800
I see no one on board.

128
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,150
An abandoned ship, huh?

129
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,110
Scrap wood... Scrap iron...

130
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,080
This place makes me... feel quite at home.

131
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,460
I have to do something
about my disabled body first.

132
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,420
Well... anyway, what's up with
that funny looking body of yours?

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Shut up! Since my whole
body became of no use,

134
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,430
I rebuilt my body using iron
scraps and escaped death!

135
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,090
We never change, huh?

136
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,530
Whenever we meet face to face,
we yell at each other.

137
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:50,270
I still won't forgive you... and you
may feel the same about me, too.

138
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,130
Franky... I'm... really...

139
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,740
...glad that... you're alive.

140
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,580
The hell with "I'm glad that you're alive"!

141
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,590
Just because I'm alive, he ended up
helping me achieve my dream.

142
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,780
You're quite an idiot, too, Iceberg.

143
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,280
"Whoa, Luffy! What a coincidence
to see you in a place like this!

144
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,910
I was just taking a stroll...
but, well, this must just be fate.

145
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,730
What can you do? I'll come
back and rejoin the gang!"

146
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,010
So this is pattern 53.

147
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,620
But not being able to use it
unless they find me is a flaw.

148
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,120
In that case, I should take
some initiative myself.

149
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,540
Yep! That's what I'll do!

150
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,640
What? Why are they all looking so serious?

151
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,860
It seems that the Straw Hats
really have become edgy

152
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,030
and lost their cohesiveness without me.

153
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,770
Okay, then, for everyone's sake, I'll...!

154
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,060
Pattern 34!

155
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,960
"Ah-choo! Ah-choo!
Geez, that night breeze is cold!"

156
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,290
I'd sneeze loudly so that they'd hear me.

157
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,550
Yep, they're coming.

158
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,670
This is the crucial moment. I definitely
have to act like this is a coincidence.

159
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,070
"Oh, is that you over there, Usopp?"

160
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,240
"Well, I just happened to be passing by."

161
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,660
"You shouldn't stay outside, you'll catch cold.

162
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,680
Come inside and have something warm."

163
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,580
"Oh, yeah? Well, I know
exactly how you guys feel.

164
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,550
After all, you need me, right?

165
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,770
Let's let bygones be bygones!

166
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,690
I'm back!"

167
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,650
Oh, they're going to bed?

168
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,080
The new ship is coming
together quickly, and I haven't yet...

169
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,410
I need to somehow rejoin the gang.

170
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,330
All right, now that it's come to this,
I'll come up with more patterns!

171
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,110
Bro! I brought some food and drinks!

172
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,090
For you Galley-La guys, too! Take a little break!

173
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,310
We brought you cold cola, Bro!

174
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,050
We chilled them good!

175
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,890
Yaay! I was pretty hungry!

176
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,020
Of course, you brought some
of this stuff, too, right?

177
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,060
Iceberg-san! Franky!
Go ahead and take a break.

178
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,890
You guys have been working
without eating or drinking.

179
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,210
There's no way you can keep on going like that!

180
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,030
Yeah, we can take a break later!

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well... then I'll take you up on that offer.

182
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,580
I guess it's not a bad idea for me
to replenish cola and power up.

183
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,610
Replenishment completed! Super... Franky!

184
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,050
--Yeah, he is!
--Yeah!

185
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,010
Franky, what're you going to do
once the ship is completed?

186
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,180
What am I gonna do?

187
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,380
Once you hand the ship over to the Straw Hats,

188
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,010
are you going to be satisfied?

189
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,980
Does that mean you've achieved your dream?

190
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,440
You like those guys, right?

191
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,560
Like I told you so many times,

192
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,910
I have no intention whatsoever
of leaving this island.

193
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,270
I see...

194
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,750
Bro...

195
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,980
Now, I'm gonna go back to work!

196
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,300
Yokozuna, you sit back and relax for a while.

197
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,360
Ribbit.

198
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,080
Paulie, it's you guys' turn now.

199
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,510
When we're so exhausted that we
can't even manage a late-night snack...

200
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,570
Those two are the very
definition of inexhaustible.

201
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,700
Indeed...

202
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,680
Hang in there, Bro!

203
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,780
Let's have a party once the ship is completed!

204
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,170
I'm looking forward to it!

205
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,280
Yeah, me too!

206
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,090
It was a short time, but I had fun with you guys.

207
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,140
We're gonna rescue you for sure!

208
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,890
I finally met someone worthy
of entrusting with my dream.

209
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,140
I couldn't be happier.

210
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,230
As I promised, I'm gonna build an amazing ship!

211
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,110
Just wait, Straw Hat!

212
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,250
Bro...

213
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,490
Iceberg! Why don't you take it
easy and get some sleep, too?!

214
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,610
Why don't you do that?!

215
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,820
Sorry, but I'm feeling super energetic!

216
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,110
Sorry, me too!

217
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,100
Are you watching this, Tom-san?

218
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,040
You were called a legendary shipwright.

219
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,210
Looks like your skills and spirit were
passed down to your disciples splendidly.

220
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,520
A log has been stored!

221
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,160
The Log Pose is pointing to the next island!

222
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,980
Then, all we need now is the ship!
I'm looking forward to it!

223
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,360
Yeah. He told us not to come until it's
done because he wants to surprise us.

224
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,090
Do you guys know where
following that log will take you?

225
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,740
No. Where is it?

226
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,120
It somehow looks like it's
pointing a little downwards.

227
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,920
Of course it is. The next island
is a paradise on the seabed...

228
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,250
Fishman Island!

229
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,170
What?! F-F-Fishman Island?!

230
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,340
Finally?!

231
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,100
What?! What's wrong, Sanji?!

232
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,520
Fishman Island, huh?
I have mixed feelings about it.

233
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,070
Yeah, it reminds us of what
happened in your village.

234
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,660
But even though they were fishmen,
they were pirates, right?

235
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,500
You're exactly right, though you're stupid,
you damn jerk! I'm impressed!

236
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,610
Fishman Island is a famous
place in the Grand Line.

237
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:12,010
Beautiful mermaids draw arcs
over the water and play with fish.

238
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,510
It's a dream kingdom!

239
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,300
Is that right? That's amazing!

240
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,130
Can't I be allowed to dream?! I'm a pirate!

241
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,480
They do have young ones there!

242
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,650
But it's not easy to get to this paradise.

243
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,650
I'm concerned about it being on the seabed.

244
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,860
Well, we'll see once we go there.

245
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,950
That's not the problem.

246
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,190
Take a look at the front page.
It's a recent newspaper.

247
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,280
What's this?

248
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,580
"Fourteen more ships have
disappeared this month."

249
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,880
What does this mean?

250
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,340
The Devil's Triangle,
also known as the Florian Triangle.

251
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,390
You can't reach paradise without
passing through that area.

252
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,650
In that sea, more than 100
ships go missing every year.

253
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,520
And after they go missing, sometimes
the ships will show up with no crew,

254
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,370
and increasingly, people are seeing
ghost ships with a dead crew on them.

255
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,370
Ghosts?! That's scary!

256
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,290
We can meet skeletons that are alive?!

257
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,210
What kind of imagination do you have?

258
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,560
No! I definitely don't wanna encounter them!
I don't wanna even see them!

259
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,470
Such creepy ships!

260
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,370
What happens in that sea?

261
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,220
Beats me.

262
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,560
Those who encounter trouble
never come back, so I don't know.

263
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,690
It's a dark sea with deep fog. So be careful.

264
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,150
Nooo!

265
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,400
Anyway, it's a dangerous sea
where lots of disasters happen.

266
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,950
Make sure you are well
prepared before you set sail.

267
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,580
Along with the stories about ghost ships--

268
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,210
in other words, wrecked trading
ships and pirate ships--there are...

269
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,960
...legends of treasure ships, right?

270
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,160
Let's find ghost ships!

271
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,380
Leave it to me!

272
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,840
What?! I don't want to!

273
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,390
If the worry's just about getting lost,
don't worry, as we'll have plenty of food.

274
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,310
Treasure ships, huh? I wonder
if they have swords, too.

275
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,050
Pirate guys!

276
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,770
Straw Hat!

277
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,770
What brought you guys here?

278
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,250
Big Bro Franky asked us to bring you guys!

279
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,340
The dream ship has been completed!

280
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,960
They built an incredible ship!

281
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,800
What?! It's already done?!
That was really quick!

282
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,270
Five top-notch shipwrights
worked on it day and night!

283
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,310
Yeah, they did!

284
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,950
All right! Let's head there right away!

285
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,720
Yeah!

286
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,430
Straw Hat...!

287
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,550
Straw Hat!

288
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,510
Franky Family...

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,310
What're you guys running that
frantically for? You're out of breath.

290
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,150
To tell you the truth, we came
to ask you a huge favor.

291
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,650
Did you see the wanted posters?!

292
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,940
Wanted posters?

293
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,760
Straw Hat, the bounty on
your head has gotten crazy!

294
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,080
And all the others, too, are wanted in addition!

295
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,160
Me, too?! All right!

296
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,420
Me, too...?!

297
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,750
Me, too?!

298
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,210
Instead of having me explain,
just take a look at these.

299
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,080
All seven of you now have
bounties on your heads!

300
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,640
Straw Hat Luffy, 300-million-Berry bounty.

301
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,100
All right! It went up!

302
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,560
Pirate Hunter Zoro, 120-million-Berry bounty.

303
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,440
Cat Burglar Nami, 16-million-Berry bounty.

304
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,150
Oh, no...

305
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,830
Cotton Candy Lover Chopper,
the gang's pet, 50-Berry bounty.

306
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,540
Fifty...?

307
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,080
Devil's Child Nico Robin,
80-million-Berry bounty.

308
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,670
Who's this...?

309
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,970
Black Foot Sanji, failed to obtain
a picture, 77-million-Berry bounty.

310
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,150
Hey, Sogeking's got a bounty, too.

311
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,890
Fifty...?

312
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,950
W-Well, we sympathize with you, or well...

313
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,430
I'm sure you wanna say all sorts
of things, but, well... please wait.

314
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,920
The favor we're talking about
has something to do with this!

315
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,430
Please take a look at this!

316
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,700
Franky!

317
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,660
Cyborg Franky, 44-million-Berry bounty.

318
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,870
Oh, no! Bro's got a bounty on his head!

319
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,460
Oh, no!

320
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,810
That's right. We somehow
were able to get off the hook,

321
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,420
but Bro had no such luck.

322
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,030
If he stays in Water Seven,
his life will be in danger.

323
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,890
If he gets caught again, we're not
strong enough to rescue him!

324
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,010
But he probably will try to stay on this
island because he's worried about us.

325
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,900
So we got together and discussed it.

326
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,890
Straw Hat, please! You can
do it by force if you have to.

327
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,990
Please take Bro out to sea.
He's a pirate's son to start with!

328
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,950
Alright! Let's go get our new ship!

329
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm so looking forward to it!

330
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,540
Whoa! So is that it, Luffy?! It's huge!

331
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,190
This is incredible!

332
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,310
Franky! Where are you, Franky?!

333
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,720
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,110
"The King of Animals that Overlooks the Sea!
The Dream Ship Magnificently Completed!"

335
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,540
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
