2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,560
Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

48
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,310
He repelled Zoro's attack with his bare hand!

49
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,360
Is that your ability?

50
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,770
I have the power to repel various things.

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,850
I am a paw man,
having eaten the Paw-Paw Fruit.

52
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,480
What is that supposed to be?

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,240
Air? Is he condensing the air with his paws?

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,630
The bubble is getting smaller!

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,030
He's applying pressure to

56
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,840
a large body
of air by repelling it with his paws!

57
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,580
That's making it shrink!

58
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,270
When all of that air depressurizes,
it will generate power!

59
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,310
The giant sonic blast it creates
will be like a bomb.

60
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,150
Wh-What?!

61
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,930
A bomb?

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,080
In other words, he's making a bomb?!

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,040
A... bomb?!

64
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,550
I will spare your lives.

65
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,230
In exchange, all you need to do is
hand over Straw Hat Luffy's head.

66
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,240
As long as I get his head,
the government will not complain.

67
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,120
You want us to sell out our friend?

68
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,710
Now then, give Straw Hat to me.

69
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,580
Forget it!

70
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,190
What a pity.

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,550
"The Pain of My Crewmates Is My Pain!
Zoro's Desperate Fight!"

72
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,280
Ursus Shock!

73
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,110
Lion Strike!

74
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,360
What... are you?!

75
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,390
Are you a cyborg like Franky?

76
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,100
No, you're stronger than tempered steel!

77
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,460
That melted... steel!

78
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,170
A cyborg...

79
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,320
Although an accurate description,

80
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,490
I am nothing like Cyborg Franky.

81
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,450
I am the government's

82
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,590
incomplete human weapon,
known as a "Pacifista."

83
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,660
A Pacifista?

84
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,770
My developer is the government's
genius scientist, Dr. Vegapunk.

85
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,410
He is the most brilliant man in the world.

86
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,870
It's said his scientific knowledge is
500 years ahead of the rest of mankind.

87
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,890
He gave you an incredible body...
and you're a power holder!

88
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,040
I feel like hope is fading away.

89
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:05,120
As you can imagine,
my body refuses to do as I tell it.

90
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,930
Are you absolutely insistent
on taking Luffy's head?

91
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,150
That is the most I can compromise.

92
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,620
All right. I'll give you a head.

93
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,810
However, instead of taking his...

94
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,710
...I would appreciate it if
you took my life instead!

95
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,080
My bounty isn't worth much yet,

96
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,650
but I was going to become the
greatest swordsman in the world!

97
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,650
This should be a fair trade.

98
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,830
Are you truly willing to die

99
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,830
for that man when you harbor
such great ambition?

100
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,110
Right now, it's the only way
to save my crewmates!

101
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,330
My ambition means nothing if
I can't protect my own captain.

102
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,610
Luffy will become the King of the Pirates!

103
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,460
Wait! Wait, you stinking idiot!

104
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,310
What good will come from your death?

105
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,370
What happened to your ambition, stupid?

106
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,080
Why, you...!

107
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,780
Hey, Colossus!

108
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,720
Whoa!

109
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,760
Instead of taking that moss head
swordsman's life, take mine!

110
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,830
The Marines still don't think much of me,

111
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,570
but before long, I'll be the most
dangerous member of this crew.

112
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,690
I'm Black Foot Sanji!

113
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,190
Why, that--!

114
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,420
Now kill me!

115
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,010
Don't take his life, take mine...

116
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,650
I've always been prepared to
sacrifice myself for the others.

117
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,640
This is where I'll die gloriously!

118
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,450
Hey, please give...

119
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,960
...my regards to the others.

120
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,450
Sorry, but you'll have to
search for another cook.

121
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,230
Y-You jerk!

122
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,390
I'm begging you!

123
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,180
If I harm Straw Hat now,
I will only bring shame upon myself.

124
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,140
I am in your debt.

125
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,190
Trust me not to bring him harm.
I am a man of my word.

126
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,320
In exchange, I will...

127
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,620
...show you hell.

128
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:26,770
What I just repelled from his
body was pain... and fatigue.

129
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,170
This is all of the damage that he
accumulated in his battle with Moria.

130
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
If you want to take his place,

131
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,980
take all of his pain and
suffering unto yourself.

132
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,970
It will be impossible for
you to survive when you are

133
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,950
already on the brink of death.

134
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,610
You will die.

135
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,240
Have a small taste.

136
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,070
Well?

137
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,950
Let me... do this somewhere else!

138
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,260
He has good companions.

139
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,160
I should have expected no less
from your son, Dragon.

140
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,050
Hey, is everyone still alive?!

141
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,610
That Kuma guy must have thought we died

142
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,690
in the blast and left! So much for that!

143
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,890
Ow, ow, ow...

144
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,890
Hey, man! You've gotta be joking.

145
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,740
What's gotten into you?

146
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,080
Hey, look! My body feels light. Why is that?

147
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,070
Don't lie! That can't be true.

148
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,490
Perhaps he has taken so much
damage that it's given him a high.

149
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,420
Yeah, right! I don't buy it!

150
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,870
But it's true!

151
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,220
And I'm sayin' that's not possible!

152
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,880
Yahoo!

153
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,290
It's too hard to believe!

154
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm light! Light!

155
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,830
There is no way everyone pulled through okay!

156
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,090
Where is that jerk?!

157
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
There he is.

158
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,290
Phew, you scared me!

159
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,260
Hey, where did that Warlord go?

160
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,980
Where did all of this blood come from?!

161
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,800
Hey, are you still alive?!

162
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,270
Where is he?!

163
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,450
What happened here?!

164
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,240
No...

165
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,270
Nothing happened...!

166
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,800
I've never seen Zoro this
severely injured before.

167
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,000
What could have happened?

168
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,550
I saw what went down!

169
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,040
Isn't it wonderful to have comrades?

170
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,690
I must fulfill the promise I
made to my dear comrades!

171
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,550
On the next episode of One Piece!

172
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,140
"The Promise from a Distant Day!
The Pirates' Song and a Small Whale!"

173
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
