00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,680
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,980
Who are they?

20
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,130
Kicking Claw Force!

21
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,800
Those bruises...!

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,790
They drank the water that
shortens their lives... the fatal fuel...

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,700
They only have a few minutes left to live...

24
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,700
If you're gonna die anyway, I don't
even have to kill you myself, right?

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,870
You wicked fiend...!

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,890
This is the very definition of stupidity.

27
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,490
Howling Fangs!

28
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,770
So you're the type...
who'd die for your country, too?

29
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,910
H-Hold it!

30
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,060
Koza-san!

31
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,930
The battle is over!

32
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,480
Everyone! Subdue your anger
and drop your weapon!

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,950
The Royal Army no longer
has the will to fight!

34
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,870
Is that true...? Koza-san...?!

35
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,500
Yeah... the battle is now...

36
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,310
Koza!

37
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,340
"Where Vivi's Voice Gets Heard!
The Hero Descends!"

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,590
Koza!

39
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,630
We're gonna make an awesome city
and make this kingdom even lusher!

40
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,630
For sure!

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,340
D... Don't fight... Rebel... Army...

42
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,120
Koza-san!

43
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,770
Koza-san!

44
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,820
Koza-san!

45
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,060
How dare you shoot Koza-san?!

46
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,200
Get them!

47
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,930
Baroque Works!

48
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,810
You...! Why'd you shoot Koza?!

49
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,690
Rebel Army... L-Listen to me...

50
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,050
Ahhh! What's going on?!
A sandstorm suddenly...!

51
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,080
Rebel Army...!

52
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,090
They started shooting at us!
Those bastards...!

53
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,370
What's with this dust devil?!

54
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,930
We can't see ahead!

55
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,310
Dammit! Those bastards...!

56
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't shoot carelessly!

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,160
What's going on?!

58
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,460
Humph! There's nothing to wonder about,

59
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,820
since Baroque Works members
infiltrated both armies.

60
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,880
No!

61
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,700
Hey! Hang in there!

62
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,850
Surrender, my ass...!

63
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,380
Launching a surprise attack
by raising the white flag...!

64
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,350
Is this how the Royal Army works?!

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
How dare they play dirty?!

66
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,570
Please! Stop, everyone! Don't fight!

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,540
Look! I'm here!

68
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,930
S... Stop... Rebel Army... This battle is...

69
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,980
Are you okay?!

70
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,450
Counterattack! Royal Army!

71
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,770
Stop...! Stop already...

72
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,390
Please... Stop... Stop...

73
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,160
You fought well, young lady...

74
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,370
But... your voice will no longer reach them...

75
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,560
So this is it...

76
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,590
Run, Vivi!

77
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,030
Get away from that man!

78
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,710
No.

79
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,790
This dust devil... is your doing, isn't it?

80
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,030
Not yet...

81
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,120
If I stop the attack that's
scheduled to happen in 15 minutes,

82
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,720
I can still reduce the number of casualties!

83
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,480
If we do this, the rebellion will stop.
If we do that, the rebellion will stop.

84
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,240
Wake up, Princess.

85
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,280
I can't stand how annoying
your idealistic theory is.

86
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,190
If you wanna talk about ideals,
you have to be able to make them real.

87
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,970
You're not qualified to do that!

88
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,570
I don't care if it's annoying.

89
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,830
I won't give up on my ideals, either!

90
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,180
You could never understand!
I'm the princess of this country.

91
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,150
I won't give in to someone like you!

92
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,100
You really have no charm...

93
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,060
I won't give up... I will...

94
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,780
I will... save this country...!

95
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,380
Vivi!

96
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,240
15 minutes until the Square is blown up.

97
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,350
More and more of the auxiliary
rebel forces will gather here...

98
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,490
One after another, all without
realizing their own fate...

99
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,280
Had you let the Royal Army know earlier
about the explosion on the Square...

100
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,680
...even if there had been a panic,

101
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,720
you could've saved thousands
or tens of thousands of lives...

102
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,640
Stop! Please stop it, Crocodile!

103
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,550
In the end, your optimistic
ideas about saving everything

104
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:32,530
have resulted in the deaths of
all the citizens you love so much.

105
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:47,020
From start to finish, everyone
in this country... amused me.

106
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,090
You did a fine job of spying on our
company for the past two years...

107
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,740
It's me! Don't you recognize me?

108
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,650
I suppose I can't blame you.
I did lose some weight...

109
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,620
But when all is said and done,
you guys couldn't stop anything.

110
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,340
Stopping the rebellion...
Saving the kingdom...

111
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:28,350
Your worthless ideals... only created
more unnecessary victims...

112
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,520
Let me tell you something...

113
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,770
You can't save this country.

114
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,180
Goodbye, Princess...

115
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
It can't be...

116
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,530
Crocodile!!

117
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,670
Luffy-san!

118
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,410
Straw Hat...!

119
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,270
Just in time.

120
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,210
Luffy-san...! Pell...!

121
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,580
There isn't much time left
before the Square is blown up.

122
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,350
Everyone... is already down...

123
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,080
My voice... no longer reaches anyone...

124
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,350
At this rate, the country will...

125
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,140
Don't worry.

126
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,340
Your voice is heard by us.

127
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,980
Yes...!

128
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,830
Again, I'm saying that my injuries
are obviously worse than yours.

129
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,170
You're a man, so stop whining!
My leg is injured! I can't stand!

130
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,240
Ahh, I'm fainting. This is bad.

131
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,250
You're lying!

132
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,880
Be careful... Luffy-kun.

133
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,830
I ate lots of meat, so I got tons of blood!

134
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,150
I won't...

135
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,550
...lose again!

136
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,340
How did he get out of that
quicksand with those injuries...?

137
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,600
Luffy's alive!

138
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,910
Tony-kun!

139
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,340
Wh-Wh-What?! Luffy!

140
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,050
Vivi's here, too!

141
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,440
See?! See?! I told you! I knew it!

142
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,570
Really?

143
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,380
You don't look like someone who knew!

144
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,700
Usopp-san! Sanji-san!

145
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,390
Ahhh! What the hell, Vivi-chan?!
You're hurt so bad!

146
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,270
Usopp!

147
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,530
Nami-san... Mr. Bushido...

148
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,070
Everyone's alive...

149
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,150
Who asked you to create a prop for parties?!

150
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,720
Hey, you're standing!

151
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,050
Nami-san!

152
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,000
It... It did have a powerful attack, didn't it?

153
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,750
I'll deal with you later!

154
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,030
Vivi... So what's going on?
What's with this dust devil?

155
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,770
Yeah...

156
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,260
Hey, you jerk! Why is Nami-san
injured?! I'm gonna gut you!

157
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,700
She's just fine, isn't she...?

158
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,530
Ahh... Chopper, I have a favor to ask.

159
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,650
Will you bury my body in a wasteland?

160
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,360
He's already got fatal wounds!

161
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,150
Sorry, guys. I lost against him once...

162
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,490
So...

163
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,320
So...

164
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,270
...I won't lose again!
I'll leave the rest to you!

165
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,740
Go already.

166
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,350
If you can't win...

167
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,470
...who can?!

168
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,850
I'm gonna put an end...

169
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,760
...to all this!

170
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,430
Yeah!

171
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,450
Everyone...

172
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,480
I still have... this many friends...

173
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,140
You bastard!

174
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,180
No matter how many times
you try, you can't even hit me.

175
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,280
Looks like you wanna be skewered again.

176
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,190
Gum-Gum...!

177
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,090
Who is that?!

178
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,010
Could he... possibly...?!

179
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,430
...Buzzsaw!

180
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,570
He hit Crocodile...!

181
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,870
Well, well...

182
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,480
Get up.

183
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,510
That time, the water that dropped on
your hand... the water I got in Yuba...

184
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,860
...taught me that you can't turn
into sand once you touch water.

185
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,710
You take rain away because
you're afraid of water, right?

186
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,000
Now I can beat you up.

187
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,590
Our fight starts now.

188
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,950
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

189
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,890
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

190
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,120
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

191
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,570
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

192
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:50,790
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

193
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,250
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

194
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,000
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

195
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,750
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

196
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,140
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

197
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,100
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

198
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,280
A never-ending journey to be together

199
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

200
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,050
Crocodile! I'll beat you up this time!

201
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,020
Luffy! Don't lose against a guy like him!

202
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,100
Geez... You sure took your time getting here.

203
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,820
Okay, then! I'll leave the rest to you!

204
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,540
Hey! Don't run away!
We're gonna look for the cannoneer!

205
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,630
Is he nearby?!

206
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,090
There's no time left! This is the last chance!

207
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,620
On the next episode of One Piece!

208
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,480
"Sand Gator and Water Luffy!
The Second Round of the Duel"

209
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,850
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
