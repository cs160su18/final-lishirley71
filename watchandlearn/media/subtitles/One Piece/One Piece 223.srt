00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,230
That straw hat guy?

24
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,190
I'm surprised that Roronoa Zoro
couldn't perceive his strength.

25
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,940
I couldn't perceive it?

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,160
Hey, now you want to fight Luffy, don't you?

27
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,170
I see...

28
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,380
Did you find something out, Robin?

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,380
I figured out the culprit who
took your memories away...

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,300
No... I mean, the real culprit.

31
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,180
That damn brat isn't the culprit?

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,470
Now, let's head to the Sea God's Palace.

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,270
The Sea God's Palace?

34
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,480
What the heck is that?

35
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,690
I'm calling it that for now...

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:03,240
"Zoro Bares His Fangs!
A Savage Animal Stands in the Way!"

37
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,950
So that damn brat's home turf is ahead of here?

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,670
--Yeah.
--Hey, so, who's the real culprit?

39
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,170
Isn't it about time you told us?

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,630
I'm pretty sure you'll know when
we get to the Sea God's Palace.

41
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,890
Don't tell me... they're gonna take
me deep in the jungle, lock me up,

42
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,310
and then they're gonna take the gold away...!

43
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,020
Oh, no...!

44
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,480
I wonder if he really is here...

45
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,400
This place seems kinda peaceful.

46
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,490
D-Don't let your guard down.
This is that damn brat's home turf.

47
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,960
He might have crazy monsters
as his subordinates.

48
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,120
M-Monsters?

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,500
To start with, monsters
normally hide themselves,

50
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,260
and then suddenly go "boo!" and attack you.

51
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,130
You see...

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,050
I don't know how many times monsters
lay in ambush waiting for me

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,100
when I was traveling around the ocean.

54
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,230
B... Behind you!

55
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,190
Hm? What's the matter? Did you
see a monster or something?

56
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,940
That stuff won't work on...

57
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,900
--Get if off!
--Nooo! Hey, keep away from me!

58
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,530
--Hey, please! Please! Please!
--S-Stop it! Stop it!

59
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,990
--Hm?
--Hm?

60
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,040
What're they doing?

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,920
I hate snakes! I hate snakes!

62
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,440
I finally stopped.

63
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,320
That damn giant snake! It got scared
of me, Captain Usopp, and ran away!

64
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,070
--Hey!
--Hm?

65
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,910
We got separated from everyone!
What're we gonna do, you jerk?!

66
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,370
What? Oh, shoot!

67
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,370
What're we gonna do if
monsters attack us now?!

68
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,750
Hm? Oh, don't worry about it.

69
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,760
I just told you a little joke to scare you.

70
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,430
Oh, so it was just a joke.

71
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,890
Hey! You made fun of me?! You jer...

72
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,020
M-Monster!

73
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,730
So it wasn't a joke?!

74
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,400
If you're gonna eat, eat him!

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
--He'd make a good raccoon dog soup!
--Stop it! No!

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,080
Huh...? Oh, it's you. You scared us.

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, man... Another scary guy came back.

78
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,460
At any rate, he seems kinda different
from when he was on the ship.

79
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,140
Well, if you agree to mend
your ways and be faithful to me,

80
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,560
then I'll accept you as one of the great
Captain Usopp's subordinates... Hm?

81
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,310
Hey... H-Hey! Don't ignore me!

82
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,280
Wait! Do you know where everyone is?

83
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,530
Hm?

84
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,700
Hey! Don't leave me here alone!

85
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,720
Hey! Wait up!

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,300
--Hm?
--Hey!

87
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,260
Oh, Zoro!

88
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,260
That damn swordsman again?

89
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,900
Hm? He's...

90
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,860
So you decided to come along with us?

91
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,360
--Watch out!
--Captain!

92
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,820
What is it?

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,500
What happened?!

94
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,140
Hey, what'd you do that for all of a sudden?

95
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Hm...?

96
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,610
Stop, both of you!

97
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,860
Hey, better not meddle.

98
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,700
That damn swordsman is giving off a totally
different air from when he was on the ship.

99
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,950
Don't tell me...

100
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,340
How dangerous... Stop it!

101
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,890
It's coming down!

102
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,230
Yipes!

103
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,030
Where's that straw hat guy?

104
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,110
You sure are acting reckless!

105
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,710
Guess I'm just wasting my breath
asking you to stop, huh?

106
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,210
Hey, what's going on with him?

107
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,760
It's probably a kind of hypnosis.
I bet it's because of that kid!

108
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,970
Hmph! What a hassle. Let's all
work together and stop him.

109
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,180
Leave us alone.

110
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,640
You guys, just hurry up and go.
I'll take care of him.

111
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
What?

112
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,030
Okay. Let's go.

113
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,410
--What?
--But he's fighting pirate hunter Roronoa Zoro.

114
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,830
In other words, he isn't someone
who can be stopped so easily... huh?

115
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,800
That's right. What we have
to do first is capture the boy.

116
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,140
Gum-Gum...

117
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,150
...Pistol!

118
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,280
Is that how he goes about stopping his friend?

119
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,540
If you get hit with a punch
like that, you could get killed!

120
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,500
Because the swordsman is his friend...

121
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,540
Because he realizes his strength...

122
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,090
...he knows he can't stop him
unless he fights with all his might.

123
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,130
I see...

124
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,050
I've been traveling with monstrous guys, huh?

125
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,020
Now, let's hurry.

126
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,230
I'll leave things here to you, Zoro.

127
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,950
Three-Sword Style! Whoa!

128
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,410
Gum-Gum...

129
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,540
...Gatling!

130
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,150
Oni... Giri!

131
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh, that's right!

132
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,120
Right here are a cook, a ship's doctor,
a sniper, and me, a navigator.

133
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,710
There's no problem sailing out
on the ship with these members.

134
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,710
Say, everyone!

135
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,670
Hm?

136
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,130
Are you really gonna listen
to that woman and follow her?

137
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,850
--Hm?
--Pirates are all devious and sneaky.

138
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,980
You're being deceived by that
pirate named Luffy and this woman!

139
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,690
It's about time for you to notice that!

140
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,530
If you come with me, I'll take
you wherever you wish to go!

141
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,330
Don't you wanna go back to
your hometown? Don't you?!

142
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,300
I have a place that I wanna go
back to... That I have to go back to.

143
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,180
There's no telling where they're taking me.

144
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,260
Rather than being with monsters
like them, maybe I should go with her.

145
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,770
Sure, I, too, have a place like that.

146
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,770
Right?! Right?! Right?!

147
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,440
Then what's there to think about?
Let's go back together.

148
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,780
I can't blame you for not trusting us,
since you don't remember things.

149
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,410
But just take my word for it and come with me.

150
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,670
See? Did you hear that?! She's deceiving us!

151
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,130
Everyone has a dream... that they
want to achieve on this sea.

152
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,210
Don't be silly!

153
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,260
There's no way we could live just
by chasing our dreams as we please!

154
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,300
Give me a break!

155
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,140
Yeah... But...

156
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,180
...what could be more
important than your dream?

157
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,310
Ah...

158
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,440
"Let's chase our dreams.
There's nothing funner than that."

159
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,780
I'm sure our captain would say that.

160
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,290
I...

161
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,370
I'll go with Nami.

162
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,790
Hey, let's go back to our hometowns.

163
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,670
I'll go with Luffy.

164
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,300
Why?!

165
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,970
He accepted me as his friend...

166
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,270
...just like Dr. Hiriluk and Doctorine did!

167
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,520
Besides... before I go to the
place I need to go back to...

168
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,810
Before I achieve my dream...

169
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:47,780
Before anything, I have to catch
that damn brat and kick his ass.

170
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,950
I-I can't believe you guys...

171
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,700
So, we're gonna go.

172
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,910
Now, shall we go?

173
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:11,640
Dammit! We can't just go back without
getting our memories back, can we?!

174
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,850
What? Ahh... Hey!

175
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,230
Geez... Now that it's come to this,
even if it's just me, I'll...

176
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,810
Ah...

177
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,770
Gold...!

178
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,540
Three-Sword Style... Secret Technique!

179
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,580
Gum-Gum...

180
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,350
...Bazooka!

181
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,390
Three Thousand Worlds!

182
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,360
Strange things sometimes
happen in the Grand Line.

183
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,200
Sailors suddenly losing their memories
one day during their voyages...

184
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,410
You've heard things like that, haven't you?

185
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,420
That phenomenon is
happening on this island, then?

186
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,760
On the stone monument
we found on our way here,

187
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,010
a story was written about a monster
who lives off of people's memories.

188
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,100
It seems like it has this island as its base.

189
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,970
This story is practically a legend,

190
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,430
but thinking that way makes the most sense.

191
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,600
Since memories are created every day,

192
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,270
it must be eating the islanders'
memories little by little.

193
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,820
I see. So it's like a broiler, huh?

194
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,570
Hmm... Although I have a
hard time buying that story,

195
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,330
it's also true that we're
missing some of our memories.

196
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,790
Hey!

197
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,120
Stop right there!

198
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,080
What?!

199
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,720
Seriously, pirates are really persistent.

200
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,340
I'm gonna manipulate you guys
just like that swordsman

201
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,260
and have you guys crush each other.

202
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,900
Oh, no!

203
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,570
--Wh-What's going on?!
--What are these hands?! Ugh!
Hands are growing out of my head!

204
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,150
What's going on?!

205
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,490
Looks like you should be the first.

206
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,660
It's not my style to kick a brat, but...

207
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,120
No, it's not the boy!

208
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,860
Wh-What on earth was I...

209
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,660
Was it you who stole our memories?

210
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,500
Cook... That boy was just
being manipulated, that's all.

211
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,210
The real culprit is...

212
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,550
Hm?

213
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,440
Hey, hold it.

214
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,400
Give us back what belongs to us,
or I can't let you go through here.

215
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,030
"I went to so much trouble
to get such tasty memories.

216
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,580
I'm not gonna give them back, you idiot!"

217
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,460
What?!

218
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,880
Our ship's doctor can
understand animal languages.

219
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,590
Don't talk nonsense, you idiot!

220
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,470
He's saying, "How rude!
I'm not an idiot! I'm a sea horse!"

221
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,560
That's not the point!

222
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,650
Ahh! You...!

223
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,020
Ah! You...!

224
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,200
Hurry up and spit out our memories!

225
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,620
Oh? I...

226
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,340
It's not...

227
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,300
...over yet!

228
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,720
Hm?

229
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,140
--Sanji-kun!
--My memories are back!

230
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,350
We all got our memories back!

231
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,770
Cook, how about you?

232
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,730
Of course, I got them back, too!
Robin-chan! Nami-san!

233
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,860
Even after I got my memories back,
you two are beautiful!

234
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,490
But...

235
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,530
...we don't know if that moss-head
guy got his memories back...

236
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,040
If Zoro didn't get his
memories back, what on earth...

237
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,210
Zoro...!

238
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,010
Where is Luffy?

239
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,470
Did Luffy get cut down by Zoro?

240
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,680
Don't tell me... It can't be...

241
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,980
Where's our captain?

242
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,070
You damn swordsman...!

243
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,620
If you're gonna harm the ladies,
I'll be your opponent.

244
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,010
He said, "I still haven't
played my trump card yet"!

245
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

246
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

247
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

248
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

249
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

250
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

251
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

252
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

253
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

254
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

255
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

256
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

257
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

258
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

259
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

260
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

261
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,200
Eternally... Eternally...

262
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,590
What the heck is that thing saying?

263
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,760
"If I can obtain all your rich
memories, I can become one!"

264
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,260
Become what?!

265
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,180
I don't know.

266
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,270
He's saying that he's gonna play
his trump card! Everyone, watch out!

267
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

268
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,270
"The Last Counterattack by the Memory
Thief Who Revealed His True Colors!"

269
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,650
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
