00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

22

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

It's not our way to worry

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,230

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,980
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

78
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,570
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

79
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,780
and set sail for the Fish-Man Island...

80
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,280
...located 10,000 meters below sea level
to go on to the next stage - the New World.

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,910
Gum-Gum...

82
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,410
...Elephant Gun!

83
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,220
Hey, Ankoro! You can't do that!

84
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,010
Don't eat ships!

85
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,850
D-Did he help us?

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,480
Let's go! We have to get away
anyway! He is a monster too!

87
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,480
What the hell is that?!

88
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:29,030
"Undersea Volcanic Eruption!
Drifting to the Fish-Man Island!"

89
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,300
--Dead men tell no tales, they have no desire.
--Is that...

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,760
--...me?
--In the dark land where even crows can't fly.

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,690
Dead men don't need jewels on their finger.

92
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,480
You can't even see
somebody's sorrow in the dark.

93
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:08,660
Look for it! Look for it!
Sunken treasures are mine!

94
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,830
I am the richest person in the
world - Captain Vander Decken!

95
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,550
Don't tell me it's...!

96
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,300
Even in the sea?!

97
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,600
A ghost ship?!

98
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,940
You shouldn't be so scared!

99
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,190
I turned! For no reason!

100
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,110
Oh no!

101
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,660
It's a ghost ship!

102
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,380
We thought that you were
a ghost at that moment!

103
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,670
Th-That is the real one! Look at that sail!

104
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,470
The infamous Flying Dutchman!

105
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,850
It shouldn't exist in the real world!

106
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,730
It happened several hundred years ago.

107
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,730
One stormy day, the captain of the
pirate ship suddenly lost his mind

108
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,950
and killed all his crew by throwing
them into troubled waters one by one!

109
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,830
And he even cursed the gods!

110
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,050
The name of the captain was Vander Decken

111
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,500
and the ship was the Flying Dutchman!

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,420
The gods got mad at him

113
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:48,510
and set him adrift forever
under constant tortured!

114
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:55,560
And the ship right in front of us is
Captain Vander Decken's haunted ship!

115
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,690
Calm down!

116
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,570
We thought that Brook's ship
was a ghost ship but it wasn't.

117
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,070
What we found on that ship was nothing
special - just this funny skeleton!

118
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,120
Franky-san is harsh!

119
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,450
And 30 degrees is hard!

120
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,890
You're right!

121
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,910
Ghost ships aren't something
that you see often.

122
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,670
We just saw the Kraken which was
believed to be an imaginary monster

123
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,380
so it's not that surprising
to see a ghost ship.

124
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,930
Then maybe that's...

125
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,270
A real ghost ship!

126
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,730
I'm scared!

127
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:49,320
Robin, you can't entertain
yourself by making them upset.

128
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Captain Vander Decken!
Wadatsumi and Ankoro got a pirate ship!

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,830
Stupid humans! But they
have quite a good ship.

130
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,250
They have a whole bunch
of treasure! I suspect!

131
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,300
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

132
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,510
Please come back!

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,800
Shut up! We have to get
through this by ourselves!

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,930
So Luffy and the others can come back to us!

135
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,900
The water temperature has been
increasing for quite a while.

136
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,200
Could this be...

137
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,740
Ankoro! Wadatsumi!

138
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,500
We can't seize their treasure
if you eat the ship

139
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,460
so knock it down!

140
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,670
I got it!

141
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,460
--Oh no, the Sea Bonze is...
--He's our enemy after all!

142
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,590
--Franky, use Coup de Burst!
--I can't! The fuel has run out!

143
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,680
I have to fill up with
cola in the energy room!

144
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,440
We don't have time!

145
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,940
--No!
--He's gonna get us!

146
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,160
Kraken!

147
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,090
The Monster of the Arctic--Kraken?

148
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,220
You bastard!

149
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,230
Alright, that's enough. Stop!

150
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,700
Good job!

151
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,910
Hey!

152
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,290
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

153
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,090
I'm glad that you're all alive!

154
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,920
What were you doing?!

155
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,590
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

156
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,390
We've been looking for you guys!

157
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,310
They're so high-maintenance. They got lost!

158
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,230
Sanji, no! He's relapsing!

159
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,490
He needs rehab with less stimulating pics!

160
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,120
Hey! Wake up, Wadatsumi!

161
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,200
Avenge yourself! Get back at it!

162
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,880
Well, Sanji's bubble and mine
popped so we got into Zoro's.

163
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,090
I thought I was gonna die!

164
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,010
Don't make us worry!

165
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,380
Alright, here's a song to
celebrate your return.

166
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,510
Lots of space!  There's no place like home!

167
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,310
Luffy! I was scared!

168
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,770
You all have an amazing ability to survive.

169
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,900
I can't believe it!
You really tamed the monster octopus?

170
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,570
And are you gonna use the Kraken?

171
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,280
Yeah, I'm gonna use him like
experienced people do!

172
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,410
Right, Surume?

173
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,540
That's a squid snack!

174
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,870
Surume!

175
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,250
The Kraken is an octopus but
he named it Surume, oh yeah!

176
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,510
Alright, draw the Sunny, Surume!

177
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,140
Well, instead of making him draw the ship,

178
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,640
we have to make sure that
he's not gonna smash it up.

179
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,180
Captain, the pirate ship is...

180
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,980
Don't let it get away! Go after it!

181
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,520
Yeah!

182
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,780
What is it?

183
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,370
This is no good, Captain Vander Decken!

184
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,010
Oh no, the undersea volcano's gonna erupt!

185
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,720
What?!

186
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,300
We are too close to it!

187
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,100
Everyone! Let's go back for now!

188
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,560
Roger! Captain Vander Decken!

189
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,030
Ankoro! Wadatsumi! Draw the ship!

190
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,980
Oh, okay!

191
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,910
I am the richest person in the
world - Captain Vander Decken!

192
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,990
Oh no!

193
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,580
Luffy, tell Kraken to get away from here now!

194
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,710
Yeah!

195
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,040
--Hey, Surume!
--Wait, don't need to!

196
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,740
He's running like hell already!

197
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,440
That's a terrible look for
such a mythical monster!

198
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,640
Nice! Maybe we can hit it off!

199
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,100
He runs awful.

200
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Don't say that. That's how
horrifying the eruption is!

201
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,440
That's right!

202
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,770
And what is he doing?

203
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,570
Wow! Yes!

204
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,450
--Come on!
--It's rehab!

205
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,910
But I wanna see the eruption!

206
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,540
--Evacuate to the front of the ship!
--Yeah!

207
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,540
It doesn't change anything!
It's only a few meters.

208
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,900
Lava's flowing along to the sea floor!

209
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,360
The temperature is soaring!

210
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Feels like I'm in boiling water!

211
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm gonna be cooked!

212
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,710
The ghost ship and the Sea Bonze!

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,170
Run, Surume!

214
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,050
You can do it!

215
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,180
Go faster, Surume, or you're
gonna become boiled octopus!

216
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,440
Boiled octopus? That's
great! I wanna eat some!

217
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,590
Because of the difference in temperature,

218
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,440
the sea current's starting to swirl!

219
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,900
Nami-san,

220
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,610
which way is the Fish-Man Island...

221
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,950
Even at a time like this?

222
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,950
Sanji, you have to focus on your rehab!

223
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,500
Keep going straight!

224
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,000
We're getting close!

225
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,380
Jump into that trench!

226
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,560
What?!

227
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,510
In there?!

228
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,020
No!

229
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,170
It's a sheer cliff! You've got to be kidding!

230
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,130
It's darker than dark!

231
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,800
Are you sure that the
Fish-Man Island is in there?!

232
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,480
It's hot in the back!

233
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,900
It's totally dark in the front! Scary!

234
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,640
I'm sure there'll be another monster!

235
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,150
I don't think we can make it home alive!

236
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,950
Luffy! The darkness is a bottomless
pot that connects to hell!

237
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,790
Iron pot! Tea caddy! Tea-tea caddy!

238
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,710
Jump in, Surume!

239
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,850
It's erupting again!

240
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,490
What is that?! Right above us!

241
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,160
--Rocks?!
--Mud?!

242
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,120
It's an avalanche of rocks and earth!

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,410
The eruption caused it!

244
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,510
I think even the Sunny would break apart

245
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,000
if one of those giant rocks hits it!

246
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,250
Get away, Surume!

247
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,380
I'm gonna go out and cut them!

248
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,300
Luffy! Hold on tightly to my leg!

249
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,220
Okay, I got it!

250
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,930
Zoro, no!

251
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,560
--Hey, let me go!
--Why are you stopping him, Robin?

252
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,100
We're 8,000 meters deep now!

253
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,520
If you go out, you'll be crushed
by the water pressure!

254
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
Then what should we do?!

255
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,660
If we can buy some time to
get away from the cliff!

256
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,490
Leave it to me!

257
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,790
Sure Kill; Green Star...

258
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,370
..."Sargasso"!

259
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,550
The sea plant popped out!

260
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,680
--It stopped...
--...The avalanche.

261
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,810
That's so cool, Usopp!

262
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,100
Cool!

263
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,020
It only holds for a while.

264
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,440
Now is the chance to get away, Surume!

265
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,070
Just in time!

266
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,420
Usopp, that was great!

267
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,130
Yes, it was great judgment!

268
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,800
We made it through!

269
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,800
It's not like I was fooling
around for the past 2 years.

270
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,680
Let me tell you about it!
It's a very touching story!

271
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,770
The days of the relentless
diet with Master Heracles'n...

272
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,770
Maybe next time.

273
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,690
Why next time?!

274
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,940
Nami-san is harsh!

275
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,400
Surume, you did great too!

276
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,450
--We're safe now!
--Thank you, Surume!

277
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,660
Surume! Surume! Hey!

278
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,160
Surume! Hey! Surume! Come on!

279
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,950
Su...

280
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:35,440
10,000 METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL "THE DEEP"
(THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEANIC TRENCH)

281
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,490
I... I'm alive!

282
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,460
Light? This deep in the sea?

283
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,420
It's too bright! My eyes are dazzled!

284
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,550
But I don't have eyes to be dazzled.

285
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,390
Hey guys, come here!

286
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,720
Look at that!

287
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
I can't see it--it's too bright.

288
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,390
Hey Nami, is that it?

289
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,270
Yeah, there's no doubt.
The needle is pointing at the island!

290
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,400
That is...

291
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,240
The Fish-Man Island!

292
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,290
It's huge!

293
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,550
It's in a big bubble! There are
clouds? Maybe there is air inside.

294
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,010
That's the Fish-Man Island
so we're 10,000 meters deep now!

295
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,180
How is there such a big
tree this deep in the water?

296
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,150
Yeah! We made it!

297
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,820
It's a popular site in the Grand Line!

298
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,620
They made it there!

299
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,330
The Mermaids dance around
here. The beautiful Mermaids!

300
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,710
I'm finally here!

301
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,010
The paradise that I've been
dreaming of since I was a kid!

302
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,850
Mermaido! Mermaido!

303
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,520
Mermai...

304
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,190
Sanji! You're not ready!
You shouldn't even think about it!

305
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,060
Sanji!

306
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,450
I'm sorry, Sanji! The rehab didn't work yet!

307
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,700
You shouldn't look at real Mermaids.

308
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,460
Doctor! It was his dream to see the
Mermaids on the Fish-Man Island!

309
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,050
But he's gonna die if he sees them!

310
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,000
No!

311
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,510
I don't care...

312
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,430
Sanji!

313
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,260
Rather than live longer without a dream,

314
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,980
I wanna die staring at the
Mermaids in a disgusting way!

315
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,890
You're scum!

316
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,190
I'm gonna look at the Mermaids!

317
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,570
--He's burning!
--The flame of his eroticism!

318
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,570
I can't wait! I wonder what
kind of meat is in their dishes!

319
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,790
Luffy, wipe your drool.
Can you give an order to Surume?

320
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,120
Let's look for the entrance.

321
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,920
Hey, what are they?!

322
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,380
Who are they?

323
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,350
The group of sea monsters!

324
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,020
We're dead! After we got all the way here!

325
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,490
They're so cool! The sea monsters!

326
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,500
Somebody's riding it!

327
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,000
Mysterious Fish-Men block their
entry to the Fish-Man Island.

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,510
They mention Arlong,
whom the Straw Hats had defeated,

329
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,800
and call themselves the New Fish-Men Pirates.

330
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,520
To evade the menacing sea beasts,

331
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,480
Luffy and Co. decide to force
their way onto Fish-Man Island.

332
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

333
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,950
"Landing at the Fish-Man Island!
Beautiful Mermaids!"

334
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
