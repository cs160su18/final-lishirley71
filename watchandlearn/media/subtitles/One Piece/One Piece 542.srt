00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,030
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,510
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,410
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,560
Find it!

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,840
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,540
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,560
I can't stand still, I can't stop

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,960
Daybreak hasn't come
yet and I can't wait

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,230
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,440
Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,880
Make waves, jump from your sleep

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,410
If you want to go to
the unbelievable world

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:14,190
your toughness, that's what it takes

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,790
Being brazen, is it a crime?

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,960
Wanted->means Winner:D

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,630
Freedom is our only rule

21
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,140
It's not our way to worry

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,670
At any cost, One Piece,
I'll be the first

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,680
My dreaming heart is huge

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,910
It's important not to wake up

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,550
I can't stand still, I can't stop

26
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,690
Daybreak hasn't come
yet and I can't wait

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,260
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:59,870
We...made it this far

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,770
We go...to where the dream is

30
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,710
We won't left anyone behind

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,410
Keep going forward, that's our pledge

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,410
Since the day that the dream began

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,720
the future that I'm
aiming at hasn't changed

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,320
I can't stand still, I can't stop

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,760
The sun of my heart will never set

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,490
One, two, Sunshine

37
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,660
One, two, Sunshine

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,140
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

39
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,540
WE GO!

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,460
Luffy reunited with Toriko and his friends
when he popped out of a Spring Shark.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,480
The group headed to Chinese Tower Island,

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,590
an island full of healthy
foods and natural cures,

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,780
in search of Seafood Fruit to cure
Chopper's illness, Deep Sea Fever.

44
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,120
They worked together to defeat
the fierce beasts on the island

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,330
and found the Seafood Fruit,
which they fed to Chopper.

46
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,330
However...

47
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,250
Chopper's illness

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,320
was not cured.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,390
Chopper!

50
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,300
"A Team is Formed! Save Chopper"

51
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,360
Isn't there anything we can do?

52
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,830
Well, since we don't know what caused it...

53
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,980
Why...

54
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,340
Why is the Sunny here?!

55
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,090
We flew here with the Coup de Burst.

56
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,680
These guys said there was a sea
in the middle of the island.

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,810
Coco! Sunny!

58
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,640
Rin!

59
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,100
And even Kiss?!

60
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,660
Toriko! I was so worried!

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,600
Why are you guys here?

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,610
My fortune told me that
danger was coming your way.

63
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,940
I thought it must be about
you or Komatsu-kun, but...

64
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,430
It looks like I was wrong.

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
The Sunny!

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,510
Yay! It's magnificent!

67
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,030
And it flies! Beautiful!

68
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,710
The name "The Sunny" is truly fantastic!

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,090
We didn't talk much last
time, so I didn't notice,

70
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,970
but you're one weird-looking guy.

71
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,700
I don't want to hear that from
a guy with swirly eyebrows!

72
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,020
What'd you say?!

73
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,350
This is... Deep Sea Fever?

74
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,650
You know it?

75
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,530
Yes. I heard about it in
Life, the nation of healing.

76
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,500
First, you turn cold and
blue, like the deep sea.

77
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,120
In the terminal stage, you turn
red hot, like the burning sun.

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,030
It peaks at sunrise...

79
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,450
And as the sun comes up,

80
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,380
death comes with it.

81
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,510
We only have a few hours until sunrise!

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,800
This is terrible!

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
Well, there is a way to save him.

84
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,660
You need the legendary Seafood Fruit to—

85
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,210
We tried that!

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,450
Just eating the fruit isn't enough.

87
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,790
Spring, summer, autumn, winter.

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,910
He must eat the legendary ingredient
of each of the four seasons together.

89
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,740
Legendary ingredient of each season?

90
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,060
Yes. The one said to be hardest to obtain

91
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,100
is the Mango Karin that blooms in spring.

92
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,460
Mango Karin?!

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,450
A sweet flower that tastes
like mango pudding,

94
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,490
also called the "spring pudding"
that heralds the coming of spring.

95
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,010
I hear its sweet flavor works as a
revitalizing tonic that cures exhaustion!

96
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,340
I wanna eat one!

97
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,230
Toriko-san, you're drooling! You're drooling!

98
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,730
It blooms in spring? Wait a minute!

99
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,750
You mean we have to go to Spring
Island and Winter Island now?

100
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,230
We can't do that in just a few hours!

101
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,140
It's all right.

102
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,400
This is Chinese Tower Island,
home of healthy foods and natural cures.

103
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,580
Let us go verify the legend
handed down on this island!

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,080
Seal

105
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,210
Are these four ingredients
really in a place like this?

106
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,970
Terry, you sense it, too?

107
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,670
I thought so. I can sense powerful
electromagnetic waves here.

108
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,250
Toriko! This is definitely the place!

109
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,940
Okay! We just have to get it out
from under the earth, right?

110
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,360
Nail Punch!

111
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,380
This is...

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Wow!

113
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,520
It's a huge mushroom tower!

114
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,330
I see.

115
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,850
This is "Mush Room."

116
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,770
Mushroom?

117
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,250
Mush Room is a tower divided into four rooms,

118
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,740
Winter
Autumn
Summer
Spring

119
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,270
with a different season on each floor.

120
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,830
So we just have to get the seasonal
ingredients from each floor, right?

121
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,460
What's something like this doing underground?

122
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,810
This island's name

123
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,160
Chinese Tower Island

124
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,560
means "an island of Chinese with a tower."

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,300
This tower is the core, the center,

126
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,630
of the island.

127
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,050
But you people certainly are
knowledgeable about foodstuffs.

128
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,840
How very heartening!

129
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,260
Toriko-san, Coco-san, and Sunny-san

130
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,180
are among the Four Heavenly Kings of Gourmet.

131
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,390
They're the cream of the Gourmet Hunter crop!

132
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,770
Four Heavenly Kings?
Then is there not one more?

133
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,360
Zebra is...

134
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,610
...is prison right now.

135
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,360
Gum-Gum Pistol!

136
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,790
Nami! Take care of Chopper!

137
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,910
Right! These two are here,
too, so we'll be fine!

138
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,920
Leave it to us!

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,720
Okay! Ready to go?

140
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
Yeah!

141
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,270
It's hot...

142
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,590
This is like the tropics!

143
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,150
So this is the summer floor, huh?

144
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,530
But why is it so bright
when there are no windows?

145
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,450
Oh, that's because of the Light Mushrooms
growing on the walls and ceiling.

146
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,240
Komatsu, you okay?

147
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,760
This heat is nothing compared
to Chopper-san's fever!

148
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,770
Banjyan Tiger (Mammal Beast) Capture Level 29

149
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,180
S-S-Something jumped out!

150
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,560
Oh, a Banjyan Tiger, huh?

151
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,990
It's said that you can harvest rich,
ripened chili paste from them.

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,250
The Banjyan Tiger is the first ingredient.

153
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,400
Oh?

154
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,970
Poison Rifle!

155
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,180
We don't have much time.

156
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,710
Perhaps we should split up and
visit each floor in groups?

157
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,380
I agree!

158
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,330
Then I'll head upstairs!

159
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,040
What? You, too?!

160
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,860
You two are so compatible!

161
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,060
We are not!

162
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,890
Luffy-san! Everyone! Leave this floor to us!

163
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,740
Why is it chasing me?!

164
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,460
And up...

165
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,290
Is this the autumn floor?

166
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,250
Toriko! Leave this one to me!

167
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,740
I'll stay here, too!

168
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,380
You guys really are compatible!

169
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,590
I told you, we are not!

170
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,820
Don't copy me! I'm staying
on this floor with Rin-chan!

171
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,340
No, no! I decided at the start
that I would stay on this floor!

172
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,600
I have a personal interest
in the ingredient here!

173
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,400
What ingredient is that?
It sounds interesting.

174
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,150
Okay, we'll leave it to you!

175
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,320
Toriko! It seems the ingredient you
can get on the next floor is sake!

176
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,490
Got it, Rin! Take care of this floor!

177
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,060
Toriko asked me to take care of it!

178
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,590
Well? What are we gonna see here?

179
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,040
Huh?

180
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,870
Have you heard of unicorns?

181
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,960
Unicorn? You mean the horse with
the single horn on the forehead?

182
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,090
Yes. It is beautiful!

183
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,340
The unicorn is a mythical
horse of many legends.

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,310
The creature we'll see here is not a unicorn,

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,560
but an eight-horned beast: an Octohorn!

186
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,120
I can't wait!

187
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,490
You mean that thing?

188
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,660
Octohorn (Eight-Horned Boar)
(Mammal Beast) Capture Level 29

189
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,060
It has an eight-horned herb on its head.

190
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,990
Wh-What?!

191
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,230
What is this?!

192
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,670
I-It's not what I imagined at all!

193
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,670
Nah, you just made up that image yourself.

194
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,550
It's c-c-cold!

195
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,490
This cold really has a kick!

196
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,020
It does...

197
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,570
But how is there a blizzard indoors?

198
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,140
There's probably warm air coming
from somewhere, causing convection.

199
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,120
Is that the cause?

200
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,380
Huh?!

201
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,130
Something's there!

202
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,130
An orangutan wearing clothes!

203
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,930
Has it adapted human customs?!

204
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,250
Wait, it looks like it's drunk!

205
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,230
This smell is...

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,450
Raochu!

207
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,030
That's the Raochu Spring,
erupting with raochu!

208
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,000
So that's the third ingredient?

209
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,700
Excuse me, could you share that sake with us?

210
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,250
Toriko-san!

211
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,340
You okay?

212
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,300
I see... That's...

213
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,500
It's my first time seeing one.

214
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,300
An orangutan whose favorite treat is raochu!

215
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,260
Raochutan (Mammal Beast) Capture Level 32

216
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,270
A Raochutan!

217
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,870
Its favorite treat is sake?

218
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,970
Then it probably won't be
easy to get it to share.

219
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,830
Be careful.

220
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,780
With all that wobbling,
we can't predict its attacks.

221
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,950
It's like drunken boxing!

222
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
Hang in there, Chopper.

223
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,970
I'm sure the others will
bring back the ingredients.

224
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,960
There's no more time.

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,300
It's almost dawn...

226
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,450
You guys!

227
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,730
Don't just watch!
Hurry up and catch this thing!

228
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,290
Just capturing it isn't enough.

229
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,180
If you don't make the Banjyan Tiger run fast,

230
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,450
you can't collect the chili paste.

231
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,660
Looks like it's figured out by instinct
that you're the easiest prey.

232
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,870
Better run hard.

233
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,960
Hey! It turned into chili paste!

234
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,990
So all that running around melted it.

235
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,220
We did it!

236
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,400
All right. We've got the first ingredient.

237
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,680
Well, this is just what I can do!

238
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,280
Franky Rocket Launcher!

239
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,540
So it's got speed, too?

240
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,110
Not bad.

241
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,360
I was so excited to see what
beautiful creature would appear...

242
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,090
and yet...

243
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,260
Rin-chan! Are you okay?!

244
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,300
I'll protect Rin-chan!

245
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,480
How dare you betray my hopes so deeply?!

246
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,720
It stopped moving!

247
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,110
My brother stopped it with his Hair Lock!

248
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,660
What the heck? Looks like that ended easily.

249
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,140
The eight horns are a little cute,
but I don't care about the rest.

250
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,790
Sorry my brother made trouble with
you with his made-up expectations.

251
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,250
Now, I'll just... take these!

252
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,010
Let's get moving!

253
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,000
You two really are compatible.

254
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,210
We're not compatible at all!

255
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,940
Toriko-san! Luffy-san!

256
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,240
That little...

257
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,240
It's so cold, I can't
move the way I want to...

258
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,700
The more it drinks, the stronger it gets!

259
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,020
The sake isn't the only
thing making it stronger.

260
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,550
There's also that leaf it's drinking out of!

261
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,580
That's a Mango Karin leaf!

262
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,090
If the leaves are here...

263
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,050
Does that mean the Mango Karin is nearby?

264
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,820
Komatsu!

265
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,670
Oh, no!

266
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,210
Don't get cocky, now!

267
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,510
What was that?! It was incredible!

268
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,690
It's Zebra! That was Zebra's Sound Bullet!

269
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,500
He shot a Sound Bullet
from inside the prison!

270
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,030
Let me enjoy this a little longer, Toriko.

271
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,280
You figure out how to deal with the rest.

272
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,080
This is the power of Zebra-san
of the Four Heavenly Kings...

273
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,420
It's warmer now that the
outside air is coming in!

274
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,620
I can move really well now!

275
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,120
It grew gigantic!

276
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,820
Could that be...

277
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,860
A Mango Karin flower?!

278
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,190
Yeah. There's no doubt.

279
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,950
All right! I'll be taking that!

280
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,250
Just wait, Chopper!

281
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,870
Third Gear!

282
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,580
Armament: Hardening!

283
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,420
Fifteen-fold...

284
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,010
Gum-Gum...

285
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,380
Elephant Gun!

286
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,970
Nail Punch!

287
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,610
All right!

288
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,400
Amazing! They beat the Raochutan!

289
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,780
This is the Mango Karin?

290
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,540
The flower isn't blooming!

291
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,910
Looks like it's too cold
for it to open completely.

292
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,100
What?! So what do we do?!

293
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,270
If it gets some warm light,
like the spring sunlight...

294
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,460
You mean light from the sun?

295
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,280
But once the sun comes up,
Chopper will be done for!

296
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,730
What the heck can we do?!

297
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,010
That's...

298
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,260
What? Is it dawn?

299
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,600
No, it's...

300
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,470
A school of Spring Sharks!

301
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,450
Spring Sharks? Like the
one that swallowed me?

302
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,400
Yeah. They're a highly valuable shark,
but they're called Spring Sharks

303
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,470
because, during the spawning
season, they glow!

304
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,200
And that glow is said to be as warm
and bright as the spring sunlight!

305
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,910
The glow of a whole school rivals
the warm glow of the sun!

306
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,560
That's...

307
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,760
The Mango Karin!

308
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,770
So... So beautiful!

309
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,110
Luffy, it looks like you have great
Food Luck for finding ingredients.

310
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,080
You had already met the last ingredient
you needed to heal Chopper,

311
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,310
the Spring Shark, once before!

312
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,700
Seafood Fruit, chili paste
from the Banjyan Tiger,

313
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,470
the eight-horned herb from the Octohorn,

314
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,340
raochu from the Raochu Spring,
and the Mango Karin flower.

315
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,330
It's finished!

316
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,350
Seafood Fruit with a sauce made
from the four seasonal ingredients!

317
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,100
Here, Chopper-san, eat this.

318
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,840
Yum!

319
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,490
You're doing that again?

320
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,540
We did it!

321
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,750
He's cured!

322
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,960
Thank you all so much!

323
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,670
I'll never forget this!

324
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,220
Toriko! See you again!

325
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,510
Yeah! Let's eat our fill of tasty food again!

326
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,810
The food you eat with
your friends is the best!

327
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,460
What's with him?

328
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,400
I guess, in spite of everything,
he's sad to say goodbye.

329
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,900
Goodbye!

330
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,150
Take care!

331
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,680
Let's meet again,

332
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,870
The Sunny!

333
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,520
That's what you meant?!

334
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,200
After a long voyage, Tiger finally
returns Koala to her home.

335
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,720
Watching Koala and her mother
in a tearful embrace,

336
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,010
Tiger sees hope for a new future
for Fish-Men and humans.

337
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,170
But his hopes are cruelly
trampled upon by humans.

338
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

339
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,940
"The Death of the Hero!
A Shocking Truth of Tiger!"

340
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
