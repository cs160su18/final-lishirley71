The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Freedom is our only compass,
We are best friends

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,410
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,510
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

75
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,530
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,620
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,510
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,250
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law

79
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,680
who's been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,740
Meanwhile, underground Dressrosa,

81
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,790
Usopp and the others started the
operation to take down Doflamingo!

82
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,620
Tail Hammer!

83
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,790
Maybe we can pull it off
without me fighting!

84
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,180
All right, guys!
I, Usoland, am taking command now!

85
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,180
Our target is a girl!

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,440
Let's go frighten her out of her wits!
Follow me!

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,390
Yes, sir!

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,490
I mean...

89
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,940
You lead the way!

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,780
Let's get to the Executive Tower!

91
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah!

92
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,660
Freeze! I'm taking over this lift!

93
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,230
Too slow!

94
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't wanna learn to fight anymore!

95
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,440
Protect me to the end!

96
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,230
I'm a toy.

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,610
Rain and wind will rust my body!

98
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,950
Why're you doing this?!
You're just a toy, what do you want?!

99
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,920
I want a peaceful country where...

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,610
...my child can live happily!

101
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,590
I will take Dressrosa back
for the King Riku Family!

102
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,000
Wh-What just happened?!

103
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,550
I-I can't believe this!
Everybody's collapsed!

104
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,040
It all happened in a blink of an eye,
in the Block D match!

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,080
Oh, wait!

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,340
Somebody is about to stand up!

107
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,120
"The End of the Match?!
A Surprising Result of Block D!"

108
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
This is a very bizarre ending for a battle!

109
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,630
All 20-some surviving tough
fighters have suddenly

110
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,840
been knocked out for an unknown reason!

111
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,580
It's never happened before
in the long history of the Corrida Colosseum!

112
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,390
But, in the center of the ring,

113
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,880
we can see the shadow of someone
who is struggling to stand up!

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,070
Is that the winner?!

115
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,260
That person of the shadow has done all this?!

116
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,930
What?!

117
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,380
R...

118
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,570
Rebecca?!

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,230
It's Rebecca who just stood to her feet!

120
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,320
The well-known warriors who we thought

121
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,780
would dominate the Block D match,

122
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,800
they're all still lying down on the ground!

123
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,670
The Corrida Colosseum Battle Tournament -

124
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,360
the last winner moving to the finals is,

125
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,220
unbelievably, a convict gladiator
and a granddaughter of King Riku,

126
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,100
the blot in the history of Dressrosa!

127
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,100
Rebecca!

128
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,990
--Screw you!
--I know she cheated!

129
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,580
What kind of trick did you use, Rebecca!

130
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,150
Check her body!

131
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,690
You did it! Rebecca!

132
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,880
What happened?

133
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,550
A cloud of dust enveloped the ring
all of a sudden.

134
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,300
Who cares?!
In any event, Rebecca has won!

135
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,310
I can't believe it!
What did she do to Cavendish-sama?!

136
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,760
Admiral Orlumbus couldn't be
beaten by such a little tramp!

137
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,340
It was The Slicing Winds of Rommel!

138
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,290
The Slicing Winds?

139
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,250
That's right.
I bet you've never heard of it-dara.

140
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,100
There was a mysterious incident
that took place in the Rommel Kingdom...

141
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,420
They say winds that cut people
blew there every night.

142
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,920
What a bizarre story-dara.

143
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,220
They dispatched the Navy soldiers right away.

144
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,430
But the winds killed a lot of them, too.

145
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,050
The only thing they found
out at the end was...

146
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:27,000
...that the wind was actually a man
who called himself Hakuba-dara.

147
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,920
He is still at large.

148
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,740
Even after he left the Rommel Kingdom,

149
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,290
Hakuba kept terrorizing
people in various towns.

150
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,260
But wherever Hakuba appears,

151
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,060
this pirate is always there
at the same time-dara.

152
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,770
What?

153
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,060
You can't get away from me!
You little bitch!

154
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,980
Go away!

155
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,520
He's acting strange!

156
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,560
He fell asleep?!

157
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,810
H-He's a sleepwalker?!

158
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,380
Yes-dara.

159
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,640
Hakuba is, indeed,

160
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,390
an alter-ego of Cavendish
that awakens while he is sleeping.

161
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,490
Because Hakuba committed a crime,

162
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,840
Cavendish had no choice but set out to the sea

163
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,720
and became a pirate-dara.

164
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,420
Poor guy.

165
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,450
Don't feel sorry for him!

166
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,570
He's enjoying the situation!
He'd take advantage of your sympathies!

167
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,340
Yes, sir!

168
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,050
He is a great swordsman.

169
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,860
But Hakuba is far stronger!

170
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,000
Having said that, he falls asleep
when his alter-ego appears

171
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,920
and that nature wasn't suitable
for a battle royal, I guess.

172
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,570
--Rebecca can't be a winner!
--I'm sure she used a pistol or something!

173
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,370
Check her out already and eliminate her!

174
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,050
What should we do?

175
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,190
What do you mean?

176
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,240
Should we inspect Rebecca?

177
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,510
That's not necessary!

178
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,620
We always check her
more strictly than the regulations demand.

179
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,320
Her equipment is the poorest
among all the competitors.

180
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,840
In the Corrida Colosseum,
the winner is the winner no matter who it is.

181
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,230
It's not our job to manipulate the facts
and spoil someone's victory!

182
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,280
She won without landing a single blow!

183
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,110
That's one way to win a fight.

184
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,570
Plus, she wasn't just lucky -
she was the only one

185
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,360
who fended off Hakuba's attack.

186
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,980
What?!

187
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,550
I couldn't see anything!
Only you my great senpai could see it!

188
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,680
No matter who it is, though,
I can't let anybody have the Flare-Flare Fruit.

189
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,780
I couldn't wait any longer!
I can finally fight now!

190
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,300
It's the finals next!

191
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,250
Strong Right!

192
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,990
He's doing it again!

193
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,860
So cool! He's totally messing around with
that mechanical guy!

194
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,600
Señor! Just kick that geek's ass already!

195
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,640
You poor girls don't get
how cool cyborgs are!

196
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,470
Look how pretty my mechanical body is!

197
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,290
Huh? I don't get it at all!
What's so cool about that?!

198
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,060
Señor's look is
ten-thousand times prettier than that!

199
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,470
Shut your mouth.

200
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,860
Don't make fun of the way a man is,
you immature flappers.

201
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,090
The way a man is?!

202
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,280
That's right.

203
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,080
This pacifier!

204
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,010
And this drool bib!

205
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,460
I'm not wearing them to attract you tramps.

206
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,140
This is my style and...

207
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,960
...it represents the way I am!

208
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,220
Oh, I'm sorry!

209
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,500
I guess we were wrong!

210
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,820
I kind of like the way you are!

211
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,680
Because I am a man, too.

212
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,980
What are you...

213
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,540
But...

214
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,010
You're my enemy.

215
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,530
I've still got to take you down!

216
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,170
I thought so.

217
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,140
DRESSROSA ROYAL PALACE

218
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,740
THE SUIT CHAMBER

219
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,630
Did you just see that?

220
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,480
Your granddaughter sure is lucky.

221
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,190
I didn't expect you to enter the competition
along with her.

222
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,160
Hey, King Riku.

223
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,590
I can't believe a man who was once a king
fought for the Devil Fruit.

224
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,170
I guess you're quite desperate.

225
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,500
Rebecca!

226
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,740
Anyway, the members of your family are
going too far today.

227
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,360
There was also Violet's betrayal.

228
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,600
It's too much to be a coincidence.

229
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,250
Is it some kind of anniversary?

230
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,860
I know you're not aware of it.

231
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,290
But what you did this morning...

232
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,470
About the report on Doflamingo's abdication

233
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,440
from the throne and the Seven Warlords
that spread all over the world...

234
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,210
It was a mistake. Just a false report.

235
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,960
When I learned that the slight hope was
just a hoax,

236
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,080
it made me want to fight for everything
in this country again.

237
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,900
That was it.

238
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,980
Oh!

239
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,730
I see. That was why you made a move.

240
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,860
But Viola was different.

241
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,900
Unlike you, she is a calculating tramp.

242
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,510
She'll never act purely on her emotions.

243
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,670
I'm sure she's weighing her options.

244
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,360
There is this top rookie
who came to challenge me.

245
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,950
A Warlord,

246
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,180
Trafalgar Law!

247
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,380
Plus, there is someone who has
demonic blood in his veins

248
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,560
and grabbed all the limelight two years ago.

249
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,960
Monkey D. Luffy.

250
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,160
That bitch is wishing those two
allied pirates will defeat me!

251
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,740
But Law is barely alive now.

252
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:32,350
And Straw Hat Luffy will never come
out of the Colosseum as a human.

253
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,040
And right now, as for the other
members of the Straw Hats,

254
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:43,900
Cyborg Franky is attacking the Toy House
on his own.

255
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,840
But I don't think he can beat
the executives of my family.

256
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,940
The rest - Pirate Hunter Zoro,
Foxfire Kin'emon, Nico Robin,

257
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,770
and Sniperking are still here.

258
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,760
But I don't think they can even reach
the underground level.

259
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,740
--Hello, sir!
--Oh! New recruits?

260
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes, sir!

261
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,940
Good for you! The job here is easy -
you just push around the toys!

262
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,170
Oh yeah? That's good to know!

263
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,180
I don't know anything about this place
so can you teach me?

264
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,650
AT THE FOOT OF THE "KING'S PLATEAU"

265
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,790
There is a lift up there!

266
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,290
LUFFY IN A CARP SUIT

267
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,930
ZORO IN A CAT SUIT

268
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,440
KIN'EMON IN A FROG SUIT

269
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,800
Listen, you all!

270
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,990
The Palace

271
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,530
The palace where Doflamingo
is and the Toy House

272
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,990
The Palace
The Toy House

273
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,830
and the trade port where the
SMILE factory are located -

274
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,730
The Palace
The Toy House
The Trade Port

275
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,810
they are all connected.

276
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,930
You mean, if we can get into the palace,

277
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,130
we can go to the Toy House and the factory?

278
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,500
That's right!

279
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,100
To go to the factory,
you have to pass through

280
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,690
either the palace or the Toy House.

281
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,590
But my colleagues must've
snuck into the trade port

282
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,540
through the secret passage that we dug.

283
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,330
We gotta go to the palace first!

284
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,450
All right. Understood.

285
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,170
But I still can't get over how

286
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,140
there are such small people
even though I see one now.

287
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,450
Yeah, she looks like a toy!
How interesting!

288
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,600
There were tons of them.

289
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,340
Oh! Let me meet them later!

290
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,470
We don't do this often!

291
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,150
We only show ourselves
to the Big Humans of the royal family

292
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,730
but you Usolanders, aka the Straw Hats,
are the exception!

293
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,770
Usolanders?

294
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:04,500
I'll explain everything later!
Operation SOP is already underway!

295
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,470
Look! There it is!

296
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,270
That's the lift to the
entrance of the palace!

297
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,580
We can go that high with it?!

298
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,240
To enter the lift, we have to show a pass
to a security guard.

299
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,740
Let's just kick his ass!

300
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,820
No!

301
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,260
If you do such a thing, it's gonna be messy

302
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,210
and we'll have to face more enemies!

303
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,810
What's so bad about that?

304
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,070
You bubblehead!

305
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,090
I'm not sure about these people.

306
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:42,340
In addition to the blockhead who gets lost easily,
I'm with a witless bubblehead!

307
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,580
Who did you call a blockhead?!

308
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,040
There is somebody there.

309
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,020
They already know that we're here?!

310
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,320
Who are you?

311
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,460
You're Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?

312
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,660
Yes, I am!

313
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,880
Shut up!

314
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,050
I've been waiting for you.

315
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,200
I'll help you enter to the palace!

316
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,320
What?!
