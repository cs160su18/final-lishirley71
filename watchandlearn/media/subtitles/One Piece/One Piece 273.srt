2
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,790
There's a dead end ahead!
He'll crash into it and die!

3
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,950
Gomorrah! Stop! Don't run randomly!

4
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,920
Stop!

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,250
Dead end? Do you see one?

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,840
Nope... I don't see anything of the sort.

7
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,650
This report is for all units!

8
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,110
The King Bull with the pirates on it broke
through the encirclement in Block D!

9
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,120
They've just reached the courthouse plaza!

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,120
I repeat! The pirates...!

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,590
To all units on Enies Lobby!

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,630
All soldiers! Head to the
courthouse plaza immediately!

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,510
The pirates have reached the courthouse plaza!

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,800
Huh?

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,670
Also, the giant gatekeepers
at the main island front gate,

16
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,180
Oimo and Kashii, went over to the pirates' side!

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,020
They're currently around the center of the
main island running towards the courthouse!

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,520
Get outta our way!

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,610
The casualties of our guards are...

20
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,400
...over 2,000!

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,020
And the captain, Straw Hat Luffy,
who beat over 1,000 all by himself,

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,820
suddenly disappeared, so we're
searching for him right now!

23
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,580
This is probably unprecedented--
the worst situation we've had

24
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,050
in the history of Enies Lobby!

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,710
What's going on?

26
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,760
What the hell is happening
on this island right now?!

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,310
You jerk!

28
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,730
He jumped!

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,370
Finger Pistol!

30
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,020
Shave!

31
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,690
Iron Body! Smash!

32
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,450
Gum-Gum... Bullet!

33
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,580
Iron Body!

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,090
Tempest Kick!

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,030
Not like this.

36
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,860
Hm?

37
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,990
I'm no good like this.

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,850
When Aokiji defeated me, I thought...

39
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,190
"If I am to encounter more
strong guys like him in the future,

40
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,540
I won't be able to protect my friends...
unless I become stronger."

41
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,620
I have friends I want by my side
even if they're not strong.

42
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,090
So if I don't get stronger
than anyone, I'll lose all of them.

43
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,000
Then what're you gonna do?

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I came up with a way to
fight with all my might...

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,390
...so that I won't lose anyone...

46
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,940
So that no one will go far away.

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,450
What's he doing?
What's happening inside his body?!

48
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,700
You'll now... no longer be
able to keep up with me.

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,830
What?

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,580
All my techniques will evolve one step further.

51
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,890
Second... Gear!

52
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,970
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

53
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,850
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

54
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,820
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

55
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,740
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

56
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,460
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

57
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,420
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

58
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,760
we will be able to make it through

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,810
Always!

60
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,640
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

61
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,610
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

62
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,730
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

63
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,240
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,570
We can't stop here

65
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,580
Around the world

66
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,750
Start me up!

67
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,730
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

68
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,640
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,600
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,770
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

71
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,610
Brand New World

72
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,900
Start me up!

73
00:05:51,120 --> 00:06:00,000
"Everything Is to Protect My Friends!
Second Gear Activated!"

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,870
Baskerville! Chief Justice
Baskerville! Come in! It's me!

75
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,550
Whoa! Chief Spandam!

76
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,550
"Courthouse"

77
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,960
This is Left Baskerville on the left!

78
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,300
This is Right Baskerville on the right.

79
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,550
And in the center, I am "All Alone
Traveling the Central Main Line"!

80
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,270
--Who the heck is that?!
--Give me a status report!

81
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,270
I heard that the pirates have already
made it to the courthouse plaza!

82
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,610
Status?

83
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,740
Hmm... Status...

84
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,620
As for the status...

85
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,400
More than the plaza,
the inside of the courthouse is...

86
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,110
...in the most terrible state!

87
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,620
What?!

88
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,170
Ch-Chief Justice! I have a report!

89
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,210
The courthouse's huge stone
doors were finally cut through

90
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,760
and the pirates have invaded!

91
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,260
I can see that already, you idiot!

92
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,720
I thought we'd see more enemies in here.

93
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,980
Looks like we can move straight ahead,
but what the heck is that?

94
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,980
What?! His head...!

95
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,270
He's like that guard dog from hell
I heard about in some story!

96
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,520
Berberus?!

97
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,990
You mean Cerberus!

98
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,240
Men! Order!

99
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,910
This is a sacred chamber of law!

100
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,960
We'll now cast judgment
on your inevitable fate!

101
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,380
Ribbit!

102
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,130
All right, guys, head to the
rooftop where Straw Hat is!

103
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,600
A group of us along with Yokozuna
will stop pursuers at the doors.

104
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,060
We've got your back, so just charge ahead!

105
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,390
Got it.

106
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,270
--Hey, look at that.
Looks like the trial has started.
--Their crime is as follows!

107
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,470
--First, the act of stepping into Enies Lobby,
--Ignore it. It's just a bother!
Which way do we go?!

108
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,390
--which belongs to the World Government, is...
--Straight ahead! There are stairs on both sides!

109
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,650
We'll take them to the upper floors!

110
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,700
All right!

111
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,900
Ahh! How rude! They ignored our sacred trial!

112
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,830
That's unforgivable! How dare
they mock the judicial island?!

113
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,420
Damn you! Die!

114
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,010
What's going on? His swords
look like they're bending!

115
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,640
Enbima Yonezu...

116
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,760
...Oni Giri!

117
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,770
Is he the one who cut open the door?

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,210
Okay, let's go. The path is now open!

119
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,990
Yep!

120
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,200
So why is a guy who's that
strong not their captain?

121
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,580
Wait! Wait! Wait! Outta my way!
Reindeer! Moron swordsman!

122
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,880
Suit guy...

123
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,710
This is a dangerous enemy camp!

124
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,290
I'll clear the path for Nami-san
to move forward! Outta my way!

125
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,420
--Whoa!
--Hey, watch it!

126
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,890
What?! Why is he starting a fight?!

127
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,670
You jerk! Are you picking a fight?!

128
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,470
Shut up! Don't you guys
get in Nami-san's royal way!

129
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,060
Nami-san, this way! Follow only me!

130
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,810
Hey, we came to rescue Robin, right?

131
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,340
Ah! That's right, Robin-chan is
waiting for me to rescue her!

132
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,190
Could she be crying right
now out of loneliness?!

133
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,490
Seriously...

134
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,540
Hm?

135
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,750
Ahhh!

136
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,870
We take our eyes off Zoro
for a second, and now he's...!

137
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,870
What?!

138
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,870
Wait, Zoro! That's the wrong way!

139
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,880
What?!

140
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,130
I said the stairs! Just what made
you think you should go that way?!

141
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,460
What're you?! A fantasista?!

142
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,170
Shut up! It was because
you didn't explain it well!

143
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,800
There's no way it was my fault!

144
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,010
Zoro, I'll try making some medicine...

145
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,340
...that works on hopelessness.

146
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,800
Hopelessness...? Hey!

147
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,150
--Chopper.
--Hm?

148
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,810
--Robin-chan! I'm coming now!
--Make sure it works on that guy, too.

149
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,230
Er... Yeah, okay, got it.

150
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,520
I wonder if Bro will be rescued safely.

151
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,900
They're the type that gets it
together when the going gets tough...

152
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,160
...probably... I'm sure... yeah...

153
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,710
This is a big crime.

154
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,290
This is a huge crime.

155
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,040
Then, we'll pick the one in the middle...

156
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,460
--Death penalty!
--Agreed!

157
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,040
Are you okay, Zoro?! This way, okay?

158
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,010
I know!

159
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,390
I'm the Chief Justice. Don't ignore me!

160
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,530
Chopper. Nami. Go on ahead.

161
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,790
I'll follow you after I take care of this guy.

162
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,630
You think you can defeat me?
What a cocky pirate!

163
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,790
I'll show you how fearful I am!

164
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,170
Pull!

165
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,890
S-Stop it!

166
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:16,600
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho...!

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,890
S-Stop...

168
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,610
We'll take you on, Cerberus!

169
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,320
Franky Family!

170
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,370
How dare you...?!

171
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,200
Let's go!

172
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,130
Ah... yeah.

173
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,930
Gear? Your techniques will evolve?

174
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,010
Are you trying to imitate a
steam engine or something

175
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,140
by blowing off steam from your body?

176
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,100
What kind of bluff is that?

177
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,870
I...

178
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm glad that I met you guys here.

179
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,580
Hm?!

180
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,500
Thanks to that, I won't have to lose my friends.

181
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,180
I'm glad that I met you guys here.

182
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,400
Thanks to that, I won't have to lose my friends.

183
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,280
What're you saying? I don't get it.

184
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,370
Isn't it because you met us that
you're about to lose your friend?

185
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,930
You're starting to say weird stuff now.

186
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,330
Have you become confused or something?

187
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,340
Gum-Gum...

188
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,300
Are you trying to aim and attack?
It'll only give me a chance to dodge.

189
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,180
Hmph! Why don't you aim
well and hit me if you can?

190
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,760
--Shave!
--...Jet Pistol!

191
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,070
Rifle!

192
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,160
I can't see him at all!

193
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,670
Stamp!

194
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,380
And Spear!

195
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,810
Missile!

196
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,570
Can't be...!

197
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,410
No, there's no mistake about it.

198
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,950
I'm glad that I met you guys here.

199
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:21,540
That man has a good command
of Shave, one of the Six Powers!

200
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,840
Air Door!

201
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,170
He disappeared...

202
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,260
This is impossible!

203
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,230
To think that a mere pirate has
a good command of Shave...?!

204
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,980
No... Besides the fact that he used Shave,

205
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,780
he strengthened his body enough
to be able to use Shave easily.

206
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,920
Does this mean that he's had that
much potential from the start?

207
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,250
What a bad joke.

208
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,050
But there's no way someone could
be faster than a Six Powers master!

209
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,870
A Six Powers master can't lose!

210
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,520
If I turn his body into a door and
contain his movements, it'll be easy.

211
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,980
I'll go all-in and end this battle in an instant!

212
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,570
Door-Door!

213
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,160
When you guys moved as
if you were disappearing,

214
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,620
I saw you moving by kicking the
ground over ten times in a moment.

215
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,910
I got the hang of it, too.

216
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,450
I'm glad I came to know a technique
for moving like that exists.

217
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,660
I'm glad that I met you guys here.

218
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,260
Thanks to that, I can continue
to protect my friends.

219
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,640
Gum-Gum...

220
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,520
I'll take it... with the strongest Iron Body!

221
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,530
Iron Body! Strength!

222
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,150
...Jet Bazooka!

223
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,750
Your body sure is made tough, huh?

224
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,560
Well then, I'll show you more
interesting stuff. Just watch!

225
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,130
Third...

226
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,750
I'm so exhausted.

227
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,380
As I thought, my body can't keep up yet.

228
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,840
Well, I don't care about my body right now.

229
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,550
I got set back quite a bit.

230
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,590
"Gates of Justice" "Tower of Law"

231
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,600
"Courthouse" "Main Island Front Gate"

232
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,810
Dammit! What's going on?!

233
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,770
Cannons! Fire the cannons!
They're gonna stomp on us!

234
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,780
That's useless! I'm not gonna stop,
you shorty guards!

235
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,700
Me, neither! You can't stop me!

236
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,790
Really, I can't believe it!

237
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,250
To think that the troublesome
gatekeepers are now on our side!

238
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,250
It's thanks to the bond between warriors!

239
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,380
Now, my brothers!
The courthouse is very close now!

240
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,800
Move forward!

241
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,840
"Main Island Front Gate"

242
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,810
"Courthouse" "Tower of Law"

243
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,340
What're you doing?! Hurry up and go in!

244
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,180
The pirates are inside
the courthouse, aren't they?!

245
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,850
Yeah, but a frog is stationed at
the main door and we can't go in!

246
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,280
A frog?!

247
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,070
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...!

248
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,360
Don't let even a single person inside!
Stand firm, Yokozuna!

249
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,220
If this defense line gets broken,
thousands of guards will surge in here!

250
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,830
Bear it until the drawbridge comes down!

251
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,790
Ribbit!

252
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,170
"Courthouse Right Tower"

253
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,000
Even just one of us would do!
Get to the top floor!

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,040
We have to pull the lever there to bring
down the drawbridge, no matter what!

255
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,180
Yeah!

256
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,510
"Courthouse Left Tower"

257
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,720
Big Sis Mozu!

258
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,490
Don't worry about me! Just go!
Bring down the bridge

259
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,530
and let the Straw Hats go over
to the Tower of Law without fail!

260
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,900
Stop them! Whatever you do,
don't let them get through!

261
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,240
Get out of our way!

262
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,790
Why did the swordsman and the
others from earlier head upstairs?!

263
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,410
I don't owe you any answer!

264
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,510
What?!

265
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,470
Forget that! You'd better hope
that Big Bro Franky is okay!

266
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,140
"Upper Floors of the Courtroom"

267
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,760
After them! Bring down the pirates!

268
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,980
Those damn guards! I didn't realize
that there were still a bunch inside!

269
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,350
There they are! Attack them!

270
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,490
Outta our way!

271
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,860
Hey! Don't throw them my way, Chopper!

272
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,700
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty...

273
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,070
What the hell are you?

274
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,880
Actually, where the hell am I?!

275
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,050
"Tower of Law"

276
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,420
We're taking Franky and Nico Robin
to the Gates of Justice already?

277
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,600
That's right! Just do as I said!

278
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,010
But the escort ship departing from
the Gates of Justice isn't ready!

279
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,060
That's fine! We can wait on the other
side of the gates as long as we need!

280
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,230
In any case, we first have to
take away the pirates' goal!

281
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,650
After all, once we go
through the Gates of Justice,

282
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,570
they can no longer do anything at all!

283
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,040
Also, gather all the members of CP9!

284
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,700
Yes, sir!

285
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,790
Now... stand up, you two!

286
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,210
I'll take you to hell immediately.

287
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,300
After that, we can take our time
and drive the pirates into a corner.

288
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,180
Giants! Giants!

289
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,320
The giants are on our side!

290
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,270
--Giants! Giants! The giants are on our side!
--Every single thing those guys do is interesting.

291
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,370
Those who have common sense
wouldn't meddle with this island.

292
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,770
Just wait and see, Chimney.

293
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,890
Whether they end up surviving this or dying,

294
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,710
the entire world will be shocked
to learn of this incident...

295
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,680
Something that no one has been able
to do in the past several hundred years.

296
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,040
After this battle,

297
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,350
the name of that straw hat kid will
be known throughout the whole world!

298
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,320
Robin!

299
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,700
He's here!

300
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,830
Luffy...

301
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,530
I've come to get you!

302
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,210
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

303
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,130
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

304
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,260
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

305
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

306
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,520
We'll become No. 1

307
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,390
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

308
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,600
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

309
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,770
an era created by risking everything

310
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,900
We always try our best, let's go!

311
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
If we want to achieve glory,

312
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,280
now is the time--don't be afraid

313
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

314
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,160
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

315
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,160
We can take off with unknown powers

316
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,420
We don't fear, and we don't waver

317
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,130
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

318
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,170
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

319
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,140
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

320
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,390
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

321
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,390
Charge ahead

322
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,270
Let's start running towards tomorrow

323
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,430
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

324
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Why did you come to rescue me?!

325
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,250
Go back! I don't wanna see your faces again!

326
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,530
What the heck are you talking about?

327
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,490
Like I said, I wanna die!

328
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,050
Listen, Robin. We've already come this far.

329
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,950
So, we're gonna rescue you anyway.

330
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

331
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,800
"Give Us Your Answer, Robin!
The Straw Hats' Outcry!!"

332
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,470
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
