00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

62

One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,100
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,320
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,030
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,210
On their way to the New World,

74
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,920
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,140
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

76
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,180
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

77
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,810
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil

78
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,150
and Zoro, Usopp and Brook got
caught by Hordy at the Ryugu Palace.

79
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm gonna go to the Ryugu Palace to save
my crew and kick that Hordy guy's ass!

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,150
I said "Don't do it"!

81
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:51,120
"Something Has Happened to Hordy!
The True Power of the Evil Drug!"

82
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,630
It's time for the decisive battle!

83
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,210
Well, as soon as we cut the King's head off,
the morale of his army will be shattered

84
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,970
and then it's over!

85
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,390
Which means we'll have a new king soon!

86
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,180
I can't wait!

87
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,990
CANDY FACTORY

88
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,740
Meanwhile, at Candy Factory
Town in the center of the island...

89
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,870
Daruma-san, w-what are you...?

90
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,710
--He's chewing the wall of the factory...
--W-What powerful jaws!

91
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,140
My fangs itch!

92
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,400
You fools!

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,950
I don't want some trendy cappuccino
and cake for my happy snack time!

94
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,990
Do I look like a yuppie?!

95
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,240
I-I'm sorry, Daruma-san!

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,410
Do you want me to bite your flesh off?!

97
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,330
My favorite snack is the bones of
big fish! And don't ever forget it!

98
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,040
Y-Yes, I'll be careful from now on!

99
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,420
That's okay. I'm gonna go chew up the
royal family and their soldiers now!

100
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,350
See you at Conchcorde Plaza!

101
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,970
We all have to be there! Don't be late!

102
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,220
What should we do about the citizens?

103
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,480
Weren't you listening to what Boss said?

104
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,610
He said "No more stepping on her picture."

105
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,320
Leave them alone!
They know what's waiting for them!

106
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,920
The New Fish-Man Pirates have...

107
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,390
...4 shark Fish-Man officers including Hordy,

108
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,890
and 1 giant squid Fish-Man.

109
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,930
Plus, they have a blue-ringed
octopus Merman as a bodyguard,

110
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,600
who is the best swordsman on the island.

111
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,690
Our only hope is the Neptune brothers.

112
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,990
I believe in the Princes!

113
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,110
Kotsun...

114
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,830
WATERWHEEL TOWN

115
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,780
At Waterwheel Town in
the north of the island...

116
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,000
--The Princes are heading to Conchcorde Plaza!
--What's gonna happen to this country?

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,380
I don't know. All we wanted was
friendly relations with humans.

118
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,760
Why should our lives be threatened?

119
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,380
I can't believe they're
gonna execute the King.

120
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,260
Can't we stop them by taking
these guys as hostages?

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,390
Hostages?

122
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,730
No, that's not gonna work.
Boss Hordy is a ruthless man-kotsun.

123
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,530
Even if you try it, he'll just cut
us off and go on as planned-kotsun.

124
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,080
This is not good. Because he
got beaten by the Princes,

125
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,620
Dosun-san's power level
went down to "kotsun."

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,750
He needs the Energy Steroid.

127
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,540
All right.

128
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,840
He's always been like that-kotsun.

129
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,510
He has too much pride-potsun.

130
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,680
"Potsun"?

131
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,610
He doesn't like Fish-Men who do
business with human pirates-posun.

132
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,860
"Posun"?

133
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,150
Those Fish-Men who transfused
blood to wounded humans,

134
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,870
he punished them by attacking
them in the dark-tosun.

135
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,200
"Tosun"?

136
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,330
Humans' blood is tainted-tosun.

137
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,540
Both giving them blood
and getting their blood...

138
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,670
...degrades our Fish-Man blood-dosun!

139
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,800
He's back to "dosun"!

140
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,140
Those Fish-Men who support
the horrible humans are...

141
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,680
...getting in the way of...

142
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,480
Be quiet!

143
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,480
...Our noble intentions-dokan!

144
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,150
He exceeded "dosun"!

145
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,570
He broke the chain!

146
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,150
You bastard!

147
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,370
The soldiers got blown away!

148
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,210
Damn Fukaboshi!
I'll get even with you-bokan!

149
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,960
I'll beat you to within an inch
of your life next time-zugan!

150
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,020
Let's go, guys-bagon!

151
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,810
To Conchcorde Plaza,
the execution ground-gaban!

152
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,990
FISH-MAN CULTURAL HALL

153
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,700
In front of the Fish-Man Cultural
Hall in the south of the island...

154
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,620
Who did you say is drunk?

155
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,700
You are, Hyouzou-san!

156
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,370
Get yourself back together!
You can't fight like that!

157
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,500
No worries, no worries! This is my treat!

158
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,710
What are you talking about?!

159
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,050
We have to fight Neptune's army
which is being led by Fukaboshi now!

160
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,560
In the worst-case scenario,
the infamous Jimbei will be there too!

161
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,060
Hey! Stand on your feet!

162
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,310
It's no good. He's as
slippery as a sea cucumber.

163
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,780
I can't believe how many degrees
your head can spin around.

164
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,570
It's not spinning! You're too drunk!

165
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,410
Boy! I bet you can't even hold your sword!

166
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,990
No, I can!

167
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,080
Hey, stay away from him!

168
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,340
Hyouzou will slice into
anyone when he gets drunk!

169
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,710
He will... slice?

170
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,970
He sliced his friend!

171
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,670
That wasn't enough!

172
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,960
I wanna cut more!

173
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,050
H-Hyouzou-san!

174
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,810
Go to the plaza now and slice up the
Neptunes to your heart's content!

175
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,930
Oiaiyonohoniaiu!

176
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,940
What are you talking about?!

177
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,980
MARINE SHOPPING MALL

178
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,690
At the Marine Shopping Mall
in the east of the island...

179
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,610
We're former soldiers of Neptune's army!
We won't let you do whatever you want!

180
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,910
What?! He disappeared!

181
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,710
What the...

182
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,710
Take this!

183
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,590
He disappeared again! How can he do that?!

184
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,270
What can you civilians do now? Nothing!

185
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,020
Zeo-san can change his skin color like
a chameleon and camouflage himself!

186
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,990
It's even hard for us to
figure out where he is!

187
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,620
I-It's impossible for
us to beat a guy like that!

188
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,620
Your only hope is...

189
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,460
...the Neptune brothers.

190
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,170
But they'll die soon just like the others.

191
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,920
Which means you folk have...

192
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,970
Oh, a bug!

193
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,470
Kill it!

194
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,860
What happened? He stopped talking.

195
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,400
Is the cockroach dead?

196
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,620
Yeah, it's flattened.

197
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,630
Wh-Which means you folk have nowhere to run.

198
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,670
There's nowhere to run!

199
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,590
He kept his nobility! He's not known as the
Noble of the Fish-Man District for nothing!

200
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,510
Is he pretending as if nothing happened?

201
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,470
It's like a revolution.

202
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,060
Later today, at Conchcorde Plaza,

203
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,240
the Neptune family will die
and the new king will rise.

204
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,900
Now, let's go to the plaza!

205
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,700
Captain Hordy! Wh-What's the matter?!

206
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,580
--It's nothing.
--But...

207
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,840
Hey, bring it to me now! As much as we have!

208
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,590
It? No way!

209
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,680
You better not take more Energy Steroid!

210
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,300
That's too much!

211
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,020
Do you want your head to
get smashed?! Just shut up!

212
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,020
Captain! We got King Neptune already!

213
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,280
Victory is within our grasp!
So you don't have to do that!

214
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,610
He's right! Don't push yourself too hard!

215
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,190
I'm running out of time!
I said "Get out of my way"!

216
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,690
I won't! I said "Leave it up to me"!

217
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,820
Why can't you understand
even after I've explained it?!

218
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,370
Shut up!

219
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't give a damn about the history
between Fish-Men and humans

220
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,750
when my friends are in danger!

221
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,880
That is why! That is why I want you to wait!

222
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,720
They both wanna help the
country and their friends.

223
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,430
Why do they have to fight?!

224
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,600
How long will it take to Conchcorde Plaza?

225
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,810
"WATERWHEEL TOWN" TO "CONCHCORDE PLAZA"

226
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,900
Less than an hour!

227
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,690
It's not the actions of a sane
man to go through the trouble of

228
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,360
executing the King at the plaza!

229
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,030
I think they just wanna lure you Princes out!

230
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,490
I don't care!

231
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,240
I am looking forward to it, rather.
I won't let them hurt my father!

232
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,170
And I won't let our people's minds close again,
not after they were just opening up!

233
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,710
Now I know why Jimbei
always had his eyes on Hordy!

234
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,720
And they are the reason we haven't seen
human pirates around the island these days!

235
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,640
I wonder if Shirahoshi is
still in the Hard Shell Tower.

236
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,020
I can't help worrying because we don't
hear anything about her-fa-so-la-ti-do!

237
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,270
Brother Fukaboshi-sama,
what do you think about the Straw Hats?

238
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,820
Madam Sharley said they
will destroy this country.

239
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,160
They did not seem like they had bad intent.

240
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,080
That's what I thought.

241
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,910
Straw Hat is Jimbei's friend and the Mermaids
at the cove didn't speak badly of them.

242
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,710
Those Mermaids sure have an eye for people!

243
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,250
But this is not the time to
think about those things!

244
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,510
Yeah, that's right-la-ti-do!

245
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:37,050
Summon all soldiers from all over the country!
We will save the King at any cost!

246
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,300
Yes, sir!

247
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,270
Much!

248
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,350
At Fishverly Hills in the
northeast of the island...

249
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,600
FISHVERLY HILLS

250
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,570
Damn!

251
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,900
I can't believe that we are still
struggling against just one sea monster!

252
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,610
There is something not
right with this sea monster!

253
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,420
You damn fools, it serves
you right! Good job, Sea Bear!

254
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,300
The Energy Steroid worked too well!

255
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,340
C-Calm down, Sea Bear! That's enough!

256
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,180
Those soldiers are barely alive.
So it's over, Sea Bear!

257
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,220
Use this! Sea monsters don't like fire.

258
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,350
Stop!

259
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,310
Much?

260
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,910
Ikaros-san's body is contorting!

261
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,660
Is it some kind of curse?

262
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,040
Put out the fire-ch, you fool!

263
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,960
Oh, crackle, crackle...

264
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,380
Fire? What about the fire?

265
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,170
I'm gonna become a piece of dried squid-ch!

266
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,470
No way, fool!

267
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,380
Oh, I'm sorry.

268
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,730
I know you were trying to roast me and
eat me with sake. I'll kill you-ch!

269
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,520
Who would do that, fool?!

270
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,770
Oh, I'm sorry!

271
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Ikaros-san once had a best
friend who was a giant squid.

272
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:19,240
One day, he went too close to the sun
and became a giant dried squid!

273
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,120
That's why when Ikaros-san sees fire, he...

274
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,910
Daidalos!

275
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,170
He's a Fish-Man. He's not
gonna be like his friend.

276
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,540
Daida...

277
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,430
Be careful hereafter-ch!

278
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,140
Oh no!

279
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,470
That Dried Squid Spear is always waiting for
its chance to turn back into a normal squid.

280
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,270
So once it gets stuck in someone,
it'll suck all fluid out of his body!

281
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,480
Ika!

282
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,950
Ika, Ika, Ika, Ika, Ika, Ika, Ika...

283
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,120
That's awful!
He's pummeling that guy who got dried out!

284
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,200
Ikaros-san, that's enough!

285
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,870
Don't we have to go to the plaza already?!

286
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,540
Much! You're right!

287
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,380
It's too late.
He already became a dried squid.

288
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,510
Minister of the Right! Look up!

289
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,640
Is that Hordy and the others?

290
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,560
I don't see Hordy but I see some
men from the Fish-Man District!

291
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,020
They're heading to the plaza!

292
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,890
Damn, those bastards!

293
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,650
Look! The King-sama is on board!

294
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,320
King Neptune-sama!

295
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,990
Help us!

296
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,240
Great Knight, perform a miracle to save us!

297
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,910
Don't call me Great Knight.

298
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,870
I can't save my citizens--look at me!

299
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,700
How pathetic!

300
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,370
King-sama!

301
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,920
We are the King's army but we
can't even protect the King?!

302
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Then, what are we here for?!

303
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,840
Ikaros-san! There are only 2
hours left until the execution!

304
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,720
Come with us to Conchcorde Plaza!

305
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,850
What happened to Captain Hordy-ch?!
I know he's there-ch!

306
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,890
Why doesn't he even come out-ch?! Much!

307
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,560
Well...

308
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,110
That drug enhances your strength
but takes years off your life.

309
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,320
You shouldn't take it in
the first place-jamon.

310
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,450
Shut up!

311
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,580
Captain Hordy said he got cut by
the pirate swordsman and it hurts!

312
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,130
Cut? The Boss got cut?!

313
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,920
So he kept taking the Energy
Steroid to kill the pain!

314
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,390
And he ended up... I mean,
we told him to stop!

315
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,730
Captain Hordy!

316
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,650
I can't... breathe!

317
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,190
My body is gonna explode!

318
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,570
Much! Is it a side-effect-ch?! So that
drug could kill you as I thought-ch!

319
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,740
Th-That's...!

320
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,420
Hey, what's wrong, Sea Bear?!

321
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,050
He's acting strange!

322
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,880
Although all these sea monsters
are under Captain Hordy's control,

323
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,840
I've never seen them get so scared!

324
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,390
--C-Captain Hordy?!
--Are you all right?!

325
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,440
Why shouldn't I be all right?

326
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,870
Captain Hordy!

327
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,630
Oh, I see some soldiers from the army!

328
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,640
Water Shot!

329
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,590
Facing the destructive power of Hordy's new form,

330
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,470
Neptune's army is defeated.

331
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,470
The citizens have only one hope remaining...

332
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,220
The three Neptune brothers!

333
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,270
They rise to face Hordy, and their battle begins!

334
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

335
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,440
"The Battle is on!
At Conchcorde Plaza!"

336
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
