00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,670
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,250
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,130
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,650
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,330
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,990
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

14
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,150
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,280
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,750
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen

17
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,160
and learned about the ruler of the
island - Caesar Clown's motive.

18
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,580
Now, get off, children!

19
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
This is your home!

20
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,630
Don't ever go out on your own!

21
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,620
My head hurts!

22
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,990
Master, give me the candy now!

23
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,130
Of course, you can have it soon.

24
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,110
Relax and enjoy the candies in the room!

25
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,390
They are very, very delicious!

26
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,390
All while trying to escape Shinokuni,

27
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,110
along with their pirate ally
- the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

28
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,280
Luffy and the others are on
the move to kidnap Caesar,

29
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,970
-- save the children, and
escape from the island.

30
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,060
"To Save Her Friends! Mocha
Runs at the Risk of Her Life!"

31
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,140
Mocha!

32
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,100
Give us the candy!

33
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,280
--Sis!
--Hurry up!

34
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,280
Uh-huh!

35
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,910
Get off of me! What are you doing?!

36
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Calm down! It's a sedative.

37
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,290
Huh? Where am I?

38
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,710
It's nothing!

39
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,070
Oh no! Go after the children!

40
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,790
Alright!

41
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,590
Give us the candy!

42
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,960
Wait!

43
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,470
Milky Ball!

44
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,350
Again!

45
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,410
This is getting nowhere!

46
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,180
How far does Mocha have to run?!

47
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,640
Candy!

48
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,350
Sis!

49
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,650
Candy...

50
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,030
Candy!

51
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
Are you alright, Mocha?!

52
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,740
Chopper-chan!

53
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,830
Go ahead while we hold them!

54
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,200
Uh-huh!

55
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,250
Wait, Mocha!

56
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,580
Let's hold the kids here!

57
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,000
We won't let them go after Mocha!

58
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,880
Please, Mocha! Hang on, somehow!

59
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,480
THE BISCUIT ROOM

60
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,040
Wh-Where am I?

61
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,960
Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you... what're you doing?!

62
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,710
This is embarrassing! No! Put me down!

63
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,790
Shut up! This is no time
for that kind of crap!

64
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,130
Look!

65
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,020
The deadly gas is flowing
into the Biscuit Room?!

66
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,140
Oh no! It'll fill up B Building in no time!

67
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,060
Now you know. So shut up!

68
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,470
You're causing me a lot of trouble!

69
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,430
What do you want?!

70
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,020
The exit is not that way!

71
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,890
What?! You should've told me sooner!

72
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,870
Put me down before we
catch up with my people!

73
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,540
Why do you have so much pride?!

74
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,610
I can just throw you away if you want!

75
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,240
What now?!

76
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,500
Is this the legendary sword - Shusui?!

77
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,660
Don't touch it! Shut up and
just hold on, you sword geek!

78
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Where should I go?

79
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,560
I don't know which way I should go anymore!

80
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,860
Candy!

81
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,110
No!

82
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,110
Mocha?!

83
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,280
Give us the candy!

84
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,660
No!

85
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,490
Candy! Candy!

86
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,200
Konbu! Biyo! Stop! Please listen to me!

87
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,450
Candy!

88
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,850
Give me the candy!

89
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,990
--Mocha!
--Oh no!

90
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,920
Some children took a detour!

91
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,880
Everybody, stop!

92
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,650
Oh no! If they get the candies,
we have to start all over again!

93
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,050
We have to separate Mocha from the kids!

94
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,350
--Mil Fleurs...
--Outta my way!

95
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,350
Let's go!

96
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,520
Milky Ball!

97
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,140
Gigantesco Mano!

98
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,570
Give us the candy!

99
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,940
--No!
--Give it to us!

100
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,910
No, you can't have it!

101
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,680
It's not fair! You can't have it all!

102
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,980
If you eat it, you can't go home!

103
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,040
Don't you wanna see your father and mother?!

104
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,680
Shut up!

105
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,330
Just give us the candy already!

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
I want to go home!!

107
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,260
I want to go home with
everybody! Safe and healthy!

108
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,900
She ate them all!

109
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,780
Mocha!

110
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,110
What is she thinking?!

111
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,150
--Give them back to us!
--Screw you!

112
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,580
How dare you eat them all, you jerk!

113
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,960
Mocha!!

114
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,890
No, spit them all out!
Mocha, can you hear me?!

115
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,100
Mocha!!

116
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,480
I told you what kind of drug they are!

117
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,020
Hey!

118
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,610
Why shouldn't we eat the candy?

119
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,070
Because...

120
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,390
...that candy is a deadly poison!

121
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,670
What?!

122
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,460
Chopper-chan.

123
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,670
They're all...

124
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,820
...my friends!

125
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,680
It's a promise!

126
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,190
--I promise!
--I promise!

127
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,650
I promise!

128
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,620
--I promise!
--I promise!

129
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,070
I promise!

130
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,570
Don't do it!

131
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,780
I promise!

132
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,600
When we grow up,

133
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,340
let's set out to the sea!

134
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,990
To the sea?!

135
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,840
To fish?

136
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,050
No, fool! To go on an adventure!

137
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,980
We'll look for an island made
of gold and that sort of thing.

138
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,810
Sounds like fun!

139
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,270
When we get well and go home,
we'll all be separated, right?

140
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,830
But if we all set out to

141
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,920
the sea when we grow up, we
can see each other again!

142
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,820
Oh, that'll be great! We've
become such good friends now!

143
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,160
When do we set out to the sea?

144
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,290
Well...

145
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,420
When we turn 20 years old!

146
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,380
That'll take forever.

147
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,530
That makes it more exciting to wait for!

148
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,260
You're right!

149
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,010
Okay, let's make a promise!

150
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,030
I promise!

151
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,950
So, the Master is a bad person?!

152
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,610
Yes, he's a very bad person.

153
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,870
But he's always very nice to us!

154
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,790
And he gives us the sweet candy everyday!

155
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,910
That's his trick.

156
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,710
What?! No way! But...

157
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,250
You children are his test subjects!

158
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,210
T-Test subjects?!

159
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,530
Open up, Mocha!

160
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,260
We're gonna go to the Biscuit Room!

161
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,760
Candy!

162
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,930
You kids were never sick from the beginning.

163
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,170
Th-That can't be...

164
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,440
Your giant body is proof.

165
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,330
I've heard turning people
into giants has been

166
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,760
a project underway for hundreds
of years all over the world.

167
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,750
Which means they've kept
failing at it for hundreds

168
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,200
of years and no one has succeeded yet.

169
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,410
You may not want to hear this but...

170
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,020
This experiment...

171
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,960
…is doomed to failure, too!

172
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,100
Caesar knows that.

173
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,290
I suppose he's just collecting
data for his next experiment.

174
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,230
Then, what's gonna happen to us?

175
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,890
You're all gonna die.

176
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,570
None of you will make it home.

177
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,320
That sweet candy is a deadly poison.

178
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,700
It'll destroy your body before you know it.

179
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,760
But as soon as you eat one,
you'll crave another one.

180
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,750
The more you eat, the harder it is
for you to get away from Caesar!

181
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,780
You see how scary it is
when you look at those kids

182
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,550
on the other side of the door, don't you?

183
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,350
I sedated you already.

184
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,580
But, from side-effects of the
candy and the experiment,

185
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,030
before you can even become an adult,

186
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,110
you'll probably die.

187
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,950
Mocha!!

188
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,350
We can't even become adults?

189
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,350
We can't see our fathers and mothers again?

190
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,480
No, if you kids don't escape now.

191
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,940
We never even thought about that.

192
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,880
We asked you to help us
because we wanted to go home!

193
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,910
We were afraid to be told to stay here

194
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,960
for another year without knowing
what kind of disease we have!

195
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,710
But...

196
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,980
But...

197
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,670
We never thought that we were gonna die.

198
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,700
We thought we could grow up!

199
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,820
That's not what we've been told!

200
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,200
We ate the candy because they gave it to us!

201
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,330
We never thought we were gonna die from it!

202
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,070
I know! It's not your fault at all!

203
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,840
That's why we can't forgive Caesar!

204
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,710
We're not gonna forgive him!

205
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,310
I'm sorry!

206
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,380
That we didn't find you sooner!

207
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,410
Chopper-chan?

208
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,830
Chopper-chan, we...

209
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,170
...don't wanna die!

210
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,210
You're not gonna die!
We're gonna save you all!

211
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,180
Caesar is actually a powerful,
horrible, evil man.

212
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,300
But... But...

213
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,430
Our captain is stronger than him!

214
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,270
He's gonna become the
king of the sea someday!

215
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,500
Luffy will kick Caesar's butt for sure!

216
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,000
So listen carefully.

217
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,420
Your name is Mocha, isn't it?

218
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,960
We can't let other children
have any more candy!

219
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,380
Uh-huh!

220
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,470
I'll try my best to sedate them all here!

221
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,010
Uh-huh!

222
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,760
So, Mocha, can you guard the
candies in the Biscuit Room?

223
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,890
Uh-huh!

224
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,390
I see! Then I won't let
anybody eat the candy!

225
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,430
I wanna go home with everybody!

226
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,480
Great!

227
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,410
Mocha!

228
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,670
Mocha spewed up blood!

229
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,000
Why? Those were just the sweet candies.

230
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,260
What happened to Mocha?

231
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,060
Hey, she doesn't look well.

232
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,730
--I can't believe it...
--The children have stopped!

233
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,920
That's what happens when you're greedy.

234
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,280
Mocha!

235
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,120
Mocha! Stay with me!

236
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,250
Why?

237
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,960
This is what the candy really does to you!

238
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,090
Mocha tried to save you all by...

239
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,710
...sacrificing herself!

240
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,470
Chopper! If you wanna sedate
them, now is the chance!

241
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,890
But I have to treat her first!

242
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,180
We have no time!

243
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,050
The children are standing still!

244
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,480
Go!

245
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Yeah!

246
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,200
Don't use violence, guys!

247
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,160
Yeah!

248
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,660
Fight numbers with numbers!

249
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,870
Yeah!

250
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,000
Bring them under control!

251
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,790
Alright!

252
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,890
--Sanji-kun?!
--The Navy?!

253
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,210
Sanji!

254
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,510
Brother! Is aiming for the
balls considered violence?

255
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,720
--It's a close call, but yes, it is.
--Alright!

256
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,780
--Medical team, step forward!
--Yes, sir!

257
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,890
Chopper, use them! They know how
to give injections at least!

258
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,150
Okay!

259
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,940
Alright, let's calm the kids down!

260
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,280
Thank you, guys!

261
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,320
1, 2, 3!

262
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,990
Advance!

263
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,530
If I'm correct, there is an
examination room around here!

264
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,730
Carry her there!

265
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,410
We have no time! Do you know that, racoon?!

266
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,560
Yes, I do!

267
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,460
Enough of the chitchat! Let's just go!

268
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,090
Mocha.--

269
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,640
Damn! It's my fault!

270
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,780
Chopper-chan...

271
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,070
Mocha, are you okay? Are you in pain?

272
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,320
Chopper-chan, I...

273
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,870
I didn't give them the candies.

274
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,330
Mocha! You...

275
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,300
Uh-huh! You tried to save
your friends, didn't you?

276
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
Thank you! Thank you!

277
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,270
They can all go home thanks to you!

278
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,100
Uh-huh...

279
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,650
I will save you at any cost, Mocha!

280
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,610
I will!

281
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,770
You'll become an adult!

282
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,580
Uh-huh.

283
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,170
What?!

284
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,050
C BUILDING 1ST FLOOR - A DUMPSTER

285
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,140
Why did the dumpster
explode all of a sudden?!

286
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,630
Wh-Who is it?!

287
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,160
Straw Hat Luffy! Why are you here?!

288
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,990
Shoot! Shoot!

289
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,840
Where's Caesar?

290
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,470
Huh?

291
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,350
What?!

292
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,680
I don't know! I-I don't know anything...

293
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,470
Where's Caesar?!

294
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,440
I-I-If you go straight down this path,
you'll get to R Building and he's there!

295
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,240
I see.

296
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,390
Thanks.

297
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,460
Brownbeard tries to save the soldiers
by revealing Caesar's true identity.

298
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,680
But Caesar manages to twist his words, and ingeniously conceals the truth.

299
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,980
After seeing Caesar laughing triumphantly,
Luffy's rage reaches its limit

300
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,350
On the next episode of One Piece!

301
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,450
"Brownbeard in Grief! Luffy
Lands a Furious Blow!"

302
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,690
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
