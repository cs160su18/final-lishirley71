00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,340
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,900
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,870
Now's the time to set
sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,340
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,360
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,620
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,330
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,620
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,800
One Piece

23
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,060
All right! All right!

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,560
There's nothing at all!

25
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,240
That ain't a giraffe...

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,240
It's got a long neck,
but it's a horse. A long-horse...

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,330
Gum-Gum Whip!

28
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,740
What's going on?!

29
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,650
Actually...

30
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,540
...I cut a bamboo tree and a spirit appeared!

31
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,010
What are they planning?!

32
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,890
We are the Foxy Pirates!

33
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,270
Don't be hasty! All we want... is a showdown!

34
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,220
"A Davy Back with the Foxy Pirates!"

35
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,950
Come to my house! I'm in your debt!
Let me offer you some hospitality!

36
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,780
--All right! Food!
--Yeah!

37
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,250
It's good to see my house again!

38
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,670
It's custom in this village to treat
visitors to milk from our farm animals.

39
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,800
Village? Where's the village?

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
And your farm animals...

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,050
What do you mean "where"?

42
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,370
The village is gone! And the farm animals!

43
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,480
Get real. Villages don't just
disappear in ten years, you know.

44
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,940
Oh, actually...

45
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,230
Well, I can explain it later.
For now, let me treat you.

46
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,740
I believe I had some milk stored away...

47
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,620
Stored away? You realize you were
on those stilts for ten years, right?

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,380
Hopefully this cheese is to your liking...

49
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,250
Don't look away! That's obviously
your ten-year-old milk!

50
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,720
I see. That's a shame.

51
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,590
Please make yourselves at home then.

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,390
Huh? This cheese is edible, old guy?

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,750
Don't even try!

54
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,230
It's okay! It's only ten-year-old cheese!

55
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,530
Unlike you folks, I live a
laid-back life on this island.

56
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,070
It's made my stomach different from yours.

57
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,350
Honestly, now. Whippersnappers
these days are so frail...

58
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,760
Call... a doctor...

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,910
I told you so, you idiot!

60
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,410
Doctor! Doctor!

61
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,210
Th-That's me!

62
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
It's food poisoning.

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,000
Obviously!

64
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,840
You're funny, old guy!

65
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,550
You're nomads?

66
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,350
Yes. We're carefree nomads,
always on the move.

67
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,480
So that's how your village
disappeared after only ten years...

68
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,020
This is the island of
Long Ring Long Land. Welcome.

69
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,860
Thanks.

70
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,990
It's technically a single ring-shaped island,

71
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,820
but because of the sea, it's usually
divided into ten separate islands.

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,240
But on one day a year,
the tide gets especially low,

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,250
and for those few hours, the island
regains its true, singular form.

74
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,380
We use this fact to migrate from one
island to the next every three years.

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,610
So you got left behind
after the village moved?

76
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,390
I like you, old guy! You're a big dummy!

77
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,700
If they stay on each island for three years,

78
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,900
then it'd take 'em thirty years
to come all the way back here.

79
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,510
Taking away the time you
were stuck on those stilts,

80
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,360
you won't see them again
for about twenty more years...

81
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,490
Pretty much.

82
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,580
If I only I had a hooorse.

83
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,810
I could catch up to the others in five years

84
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,770
by crossing to a new
island once every year...

85
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,750
"Hooorse"?

86
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,420
Yes. The most beautiful
animals on these islands.

87
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,590
They gallop through the
grassy plains so gracefully...

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,060
They're absolutely necessary
to migrate from island to island.

89
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
They're strong and can carry large loads.

90
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,190
I can't migrate on foot, either--

91
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,610
the tide would come back in before
I even got across to the next island.

92
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,280
Can't you just take a ship?

93
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,930
We don't know how to sail.

94
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,660
Besides, even if we charged a Log Pose here,

95
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,850
it wouldn't point to the
next island in the ring.

96
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,620
All ten islands are actually
one big island, after all.

97
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll just wait here twenty years.

98
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,260
You sure? It'll be lonely...

99
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,720
Oh, wait!

100
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,760
Is a "hooorse" a "horse"?

101
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,520
Oh, right! A horse! We saw one!

102
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,900
Oh! Shelly! You waited for me?!

103
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,860
Oh, Shelly! You're so adorable!
This sure brings back memories!

104
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,780
You've grown so long since I last saw you!

105
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,080
That's a good girl!

106
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,210
You must've been so lonely,
all by yourself all those years!

107
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,500
Thank you! Thank you!

108
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,280
I'll never leave you again!

109
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,590
She wants you to ride on her!

110
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,600
Ah, so that horse was waiting
for him the entire time...

111
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,360
She's great!

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,080
She must really like him a lot!

113
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,960
Man, that horse sure is
fast! I wanna ride too!

114
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,380
She really is graceful!

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,340
Shelly. Let's cross the sea
together on the next low tide day!

116
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,800
All those days with rain...

117
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,970
All those days with snow...

118
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,470
Thank you for waiting through it all!

119
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,610
Shelly... Do you really insist
on waiting for Tonjit-san?

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,910
We're going to take all
your friends with us...

121
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,240
Wait! Littonto!

122
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,070
Are you sure?

123
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,280
We won't be back here for 27 years,

124
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,060
and we have no idea where Tonjit-san even is.

125
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,390
You'll be all by yourself!

126
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,010
Take my advice, come with us!

127
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,850
I'm gonna stay too! I'm gonna
wait for Grandpa with Shelly!

128
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,080
No, you're not! You can't
stay here all alone!

129
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,560
I can too!

130
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,310
Grandpa's here! I know it!
I'm gonna wait for him too!

131
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,140
Live well, Shelly!

132
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,940
Shelly!

133
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,060
Whoa there, Shelly!

134
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,090
You know I'm afraid of heights!

135
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,810
Horse!

136
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,370
Old guy!

137
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,930
Shelly!

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,870
--You okay?!
--We heard a gunshot!

139
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,210
What's this net?!

140
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,130
--Just a sec!
--Old guy!

141
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,860
The horse is mine now!

142
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,220
Yeah! Yeah! That horse is our boss's!

143
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,970
Who are you guys?!

144
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,160
Who are you guys?!

145
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,950
Who am I, you ask?

146
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,470
They're so rude!

147
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,920
Don't pretend you don't know this face!

148
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,300
I don't know your face! I'm gonna beat it up!

149
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,560
Th-They don't know me...

150
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,100
Oh, no! Boss! Don't get depressed!

151
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,860
He's lying! I bet he's just saying that!

152
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,310
He can't possibly know him.

153
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,900
Stop laughing, Hamburg!

154
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,890
My name is Foxy! I take whatever I want!

155
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,070
Let this be a lesson, you fools!

156
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,940
Why are you so worked up
about a single horse?!

157
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,540
Hunting is nothing more than entertainment!

158
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,250
Why, you...!

159
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,080
Gum-Gum...!

160
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,670
Stop, Straw Hat Luffy!

161
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,540
How do you know my name?!

162
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,980
Of course we know who you are!
We've done our homework!

163
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,830
Monkey D. Luffy, with a
100 million-Berry bounty.

164
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,510
Roronoa Zoro, with a 60 million-Berry bounty.

165
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,570
A total bounty of 160 million
with only seven people...

166
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,770
That's really something.

167
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,270
We Foxy Pirates challenge you
Straw Hats to a "Davy Back Fight"!

168
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,990
Stop talking crazy! Just bring it on!
If you wanna fight, let's fight!

169
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,220
Wait, Luffy... A Davy Back fight is...

170
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,950
Ah! That explains the ship
we encountered near here!

171
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,800
--Which way do we turn?!
--How should I know?!

172
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,310
--Someone, give orders! Navigator!
--Don't got one!

173
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,260
--Captain!
--Don't got one!

174
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,300
Hold on, Luffy! That game...!

175
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,970
Don't do it! We'll lose crew members!

176
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,850
What's the deal, Usopp?!

177
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,770
I'm telling you, don't agree to his game!

178
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,860
Fool! I heard you say it, Straw Hat Luffy!

179
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,100
You clearly agreed to my challenge just now!

180
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,560
Didn't he, Porche-chan?!

181
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,030
Yes, Boss! I heard him, too!

182
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,130
Do you honestly think you can back out now?

183
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,350
Well, you can't.

184
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,170
Or, what? You're not man
enough to keep your word?

185
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,580
I am too!

186
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,000
--Don't get talked into it!
--But... the horse!

187
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,160
Shelly... Oww!

188
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,590
Don't push yourself! You hit your back hard!

189
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,060
--You two! Step aside!
--Old guy!

190
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,110
Shelly faithfully waited ten
years for me! How dare you...?!

191
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,400
Wait, old guy! They're pirates!

192
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,450
A Davy Back Fight?

193
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,160
"Unruly"

194
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,610
That's right! The fight begins the
moment two captains are in agreement!

195
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,410
As we speak, our captain
is challenging your captain,

196
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,420
Monkey D. Luffy, to battle!

197
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,330
Challenging? What kind of
sleepy nonsense is that?

198
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,670
If you want a fight, just start one!

199
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,970
Hey, you've never heard of a Davy Back Fight?

200
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,790
It's not a fight. It's a pirate game.

201
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,430
Yes. A game that supposedly arose
long ago on "Pirate Island,"

202
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,630
which is said to be a pirate
paradise somewhere in the sea.

203
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,650
In it, pirates plunder each other
for top-notch crew members.

204
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,990
--Pirates plunder each other?!
--Yes.

205
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,370
I'm amazed you've survived this
long without even knowing that!

206
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,950
A Davy Back Fight is about
swiping crew members!

207
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,420
After each match, the winner can take

208
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,960
any crew member they want
from the opposing team!

209
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,990
Whoever's chosen must immediately
swear loyalty to their new captain!

210
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,930
In the name of Davy Jones,
the pirate of the deep!

211
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,310
So if you lose... you lose a crew member?!

212
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,890
That's right!

213
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,690
In addition, if the enemy ship
has no one of interest,

214
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,500
they can instead be stripped of their
Jolly Roger-- the life of their ship!

215
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,270
So crewmates and pride are on the line.

216
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,880
Winning will make you stronger,
while losing will mean a serious loss.

217
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,200
What a vicious game.

218
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,250
Wait, does that mean
that ship we ran across earlier

219
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,030
without an organized crew,
sails, or even a captain was...?

220
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,330
Oh? Did you run into the
Fang-Frog Pirates' ship?!

221
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,790
They fell prey to our game earlier!

222
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,930
Say hello to our new crewmates!

223
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,350
Yeah! Long live the Foxy Pirates!

224
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,810
I was the former captain of that ship!

225
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,250
--Former ship doctor!
--Former navigator!

226
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,520
Former shipwright!

227
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,360
We tried five three-coin
games, but lost 'em all!

228
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,780
Fourteen men and our flag,
taken just like that!

229
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,530
With so many people jumping ship like this,

230
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,330
it was more like a merger than anything!

231
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,320
Yeah!

232
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,700
Idiots. How can you be so happy,
ditching your crew like that?

233
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,630
Seriously. The ship's in
a watery grave by now.

234
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,750
Watery grave...?

235
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,420
Hmph! So what?!

236
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,450
There's no talking reason with you!

237
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,260
But we'd never agree to such a
ridiculous game in a million years!

238
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,230
Fool! A regular crew member
can't make that decision!

239
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,380
This game only begins when
two captains reach an agreement!

240
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:52,190
Like it or not, you're all in this game
if your captain nods his head!

241
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,310
They're right, Nami-san.

242
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,200
This is an unwritten rule
in the pirate world.

243
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,120
Run, and we'll be completely humiliated.

244
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,580
So what if we're humiliated?!

245
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,050
I'd rather die than live in shame.

246
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,550
What he said.

247
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,590
Are you two crazy?!

248
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,600
Forget about it. This is how men are.

249
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,440
Urgh! I gotta stop Luffy, then!

250
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,860
Don't bother. It's no use.

251
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,700
The captains will signal
the start of the fight

252
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,940
by firing shots at the same time!

253
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,270
Just sit here and--!

254
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,280
Please, no...!

255
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
He agreed to it...

256
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,700
Fine by me.

257
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,530
This should be interesting.

258
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,550
He's agreed to the game!

259
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,640
You idiot! You idiot! You idiot!

260
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,310
Why did you agree to it?!

261
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,980
You have no idea how horrific this game is!

262
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,600
Then we just won't lose!

263
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,220
Our challenge is now officially accepted!

264
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,780
Yeah! I'm gonna kick your butt!

265
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,570
That'll be the day!

266
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,950
I will too, Split-Head!

267
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,330
--Split-Head...?
--Boss!

268
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,300
How dare you?! Our boss is a sensitive man!

269
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,510
He has a heart of glass.
Doesn't suit him, though.

270
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,760
Hey! I told you not to laugh!

271
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,630
Look, Luffy!

272
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,800
Thinking about the horse and the
old guy makes me mad too, but...!

273
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,260
Use that anger to thrash 'em!

274
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,350
He got back up way too fast!

275
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,570
Leave it to me!

276
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,900
I'm going to teach you a thing or two!

277
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,940
Frankfurters! Get your frankfurters!

278
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,710
Rum and cheese! Crackers and salted meat!

279
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,200
I've got yakisoba noodles too!

280
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,200
It's time for the opening ceremony!

281
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,540
--Please quiet down! Please quiet down!
--Shut up! You be quiet!

282
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,830
--C'mon! Let's hear the odds!
--All participants, get ready!

283
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,640
This is looking fun!

284
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,880
These are all Split-Head's crew members?

285
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,940
Wow! There's so many!

286
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,840
Hi. Five jumbo yakisobas, please.

287
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,640
"Cotton Candy" "Yakisoba Noodles"

288
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,760
Stop that, old guy!

289
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,260
Okay, men! Simmer down!

290
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,560
--Porche-chan!
--Sexy!

291
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,770
It's time for the pledge to follow
these three rules about losing!

292
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,970
First, the only way to take back crewmates,
Jolly Rogers, or anything else

293
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,740
is through another Davy Back Fight!

294
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,580
Second, anyone taken by the winner

295
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,210
must swear loyalty to that
ship's captain immediately!

296
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,050
Third, if your Jolly Roger is taken,
you can't ever display it again!

297
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,470
Nami-san! I bought some cotton candy!

298
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,800
How can you guys be so calm about this?

299
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,760
Are you still moping about that?

300
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,600
Should you break these rules,
you'll be considered dishonorable pirates

301
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,480
and sent to Davy Jones' Locker!

302
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,270
Do you swear to uphold them?

303
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,070
--I swear!
--I swear!

304
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,120
Okay, Straw Hat! I'll let you choose!

305
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,200
One coin? Two coins? Or three coins?

306
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,080
Choose whichever you want!

307
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,280
Oh, Boss! You're so gracious!

308
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,380
What are they for?

309
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,210
It's the number of games.

310
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,750
Our boss is letting you choose
if it should be a one-match game

311
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,130
or all the way up to a three-match game.

312
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,140
The game'll be more fun with more stuff.

313
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,310
--So I'll go with...
--Luffy!

314
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,140
Got it!

315
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,110
Three coins!

316
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,880
You idiot! Why'd you add them?!
And include an enemy in the count?!

317
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,320
So many morons!

318
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,920
I hereby announce this three-coin,
orthodox-rules game...

319
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,750
...to Davy Jones!

320
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,120
Who's Davy Jones?

321
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,990
An old pirate cursed by the devil

322
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,390
who's said to live in the depths
of the sea to this very day.

323
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,760
He lives at the bottom of the sea?!

324
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,270
That's what the legend says.

325
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,650
All the ships and treasures
that sink into the sea

326
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,810
are said to go to his ship's bosun--
his "locker," in other words.

327
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,960
The bottom of the sea is scary...

328
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,320
Sweet!

329
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,980
Pirates call this a "Davy Back"

330
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,030
because you steal whatever
you want from the enemy,

331
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,330
just as Davy takes everything
that comes sinking his way.

332
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,630
Are you ready, Straw
Hat?! Let the game begin!

333
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,090
All right! Let's do this!

334
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,230
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

335
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,780
Chasing after something constant

336
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,410
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

337
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,660
Even when we're exhausted

338
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,830
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

339
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,250
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

340
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,170
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

341
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

342
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,930
We pray to this endless
sky that we look up at

343
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,020
Eternally... Eternally...

344
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,810
Wild fantasies from our childhood

345
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,650
We trace unforgettable memories

346
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,320
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

347
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

348
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,950
Together we entrust our feelings

349
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,540
We go beyond the changing time

350
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,330
Eternally... Eternally...

351
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,300
All right! The Davy Back Fight has begun!

352
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,510
I've never lost using
orthodox rules, you know!

353
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,490
A chef, a doctor, an archaeologist...
Who should I take?!

354
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,560
No, I want that one!
Let's get this first round started!

355
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,680
--I don't understand you, Split-Head!
--He said it again...

356
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,930
On the next episode of One Piece!

357
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,440
"Round 1! One Lap of the Donut Race"

358
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,700
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
