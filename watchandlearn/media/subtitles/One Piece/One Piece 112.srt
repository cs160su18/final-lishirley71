00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:18,080
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,040
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,010
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,010
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people take up weapons.

25
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,650
The scorching land was now
engulfed in wails of grief,

26
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,670
along with tremendous upheaval.

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,690
Luffy, having separated
from Vivi and the others

28
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,680
to face Crocodile alone, fell
before his overwhelming strength,

29
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,810
and sank beneath the sands of Alabasta.

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,190
Although narrowly escaping,
thanks to Miss All-Sunday,

31
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,830
Luffy's life-threatening injuries
made his recovery hopeless.

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,660
Meanwhile, as Vivi and the others
made for the capital city of Alubarna,

33
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,120
though hindered by the
vastness of the great land,

34
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,320
they were assisted by the
unique animals of Alabasta,

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,310
favorably speeding their journey along.

36
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,270
Vivi and the others are
trying to prevent a conflict.

37
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,330
However, a rebel army,
two million strong,

38
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,060
was about to close in on Alubarna.

39
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,650
Moment by moment, the hourglass
of fate marks the final hour.

40
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,520
M-Meat...!

41
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,760
"Rebel Army vs. Royal Army!
Showdown at Alubarna!"

42
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,450
H-Hey, are you all right?

43
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,060
Meat...!

44
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,170
Meat...!

45
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,160
Meat? In your shape? What are
you talking about? Hang on.

46
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,210
I'll go get a doctor.

47
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,210
I'm going to make sure
Crocodile pays for this...

48
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,310
He made fun of Vivi...
and that dried-up old man...

49
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,270
...and he's definitely gonna pay...

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
Who are you?

51
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,010
Meat...

52
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,650
I see it! It's still far away,
but it's Alubarna!

53
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,540
Koza, we're less than 30 minutes away!

54
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,480
Right!

55
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,210
Alubarna is near!

56
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,160
Raise your spirits!

57
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,350
Chaka-sama! We've sighted the
rebel army, about 15 kilos to the south!

58
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,080
Their army, two million strong,
is bearing down on the southern gate!

59
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,320
East, west, south,
southeast, southwest...

60
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,030
Defend each gate with your lives!

61
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,000
Do not let them set foot in the city!

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,210
Yes, sir!

63
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,150
"Alubarna - West Gate"

64
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,620
Hey, look over there!
The rebel army is coming into view!

65
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,470
There's so fabulously many of them!

66
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,470
The princess is quite a
nincompoop to try to stop them.

67
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,970
But then, is the nincompoop really coming?

68
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,740
Or isn't she coming? Is she coming?
Or isn't she coming?

69
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,820
It's so vague!

70
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Are we sure about this?!
Are we sure about this?!

72
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,410
The princess and the pirates
are really coming, right?!

73
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,320
The rebel army is going to
get here first, at this rate!

74
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,380
Don't they want to stop them,
for crying out loud?!

75
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,790
There is a likely chance that
they don't make it in time.

76
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,660
Here... they... come...

77
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,660
After all, they did lose a
good deal of time at Rainbase.

78
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,930
What?! They did?!

79
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,000
Well, supposing that
the rebellion starts first,

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,640
what are we supposed to deux?

81
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,340
We don't have to deux anything,
do we? Once the war starts,

82
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,320
not even the princess will be
able to do anything about it.

83
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,950
We just need to get rid of
whoever we're told to get rid of.

84
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,950
Can't you even determine
that much for yourself?

85
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,290
It sounds like you're just
dying for a taste of my kenpo!

86
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,950
Knock it off, you two.

87
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,320
Ah, my back! My back is aching!
Mr. 4, massage it for me!

88
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:32,250
They... 're... com... ing...

89
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,260
What?!

90
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,420
Why didn't you tell us sooner,
you dim-witted daruma doll?!

91
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,360
Ducks...?

92
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,180
Ducks? What do you mean,
Miss Merry Christmas?

93
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,350
Their number has increased,
hasn't it? There are six of them.

94
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,640
There were four of them from the list,
not including Straw Hat, right?

95
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,570
You're wrong, Miss Merry Christmas.

96
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,680
Did you listen to what the boss said?
There's that Mr. Prince guy.

97
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,990
He said there were more than one of him,

98
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,120
so if you add two, the number matches.

99
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,820
No matter how many more there are,
our only target is Vivi.

100
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,510
What are you so anxious about?

101
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,110
Mr. 1...

102
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,080
You say that Vivi is the only
one we have to get rid of?

103
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,550
Well then...

104
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,280
...you can guess which one is Vivi!

105
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,000
They're all wearing the same cloaks!

106
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,820
What's more, those birds are
the fastest in all of Alabasta,

107
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,770
supersonic ducks!

108
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,650
Why, those rotten...!

109
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,270
How do we tell which one is Vivi like this?!

110
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,550
It's too vague, you know!

111
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,430
Let them have it, Mr. 4!

112
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,590
Stay away from it!

113
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,510
They dodged it!
Those birds are fast, huh?

114
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,400
Two of them broke off south!
They're splitting up!

115
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,850
They're planning to go to the south gate!

116
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,540
That's directly toward the rebel army.

117
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,160
Which means that one of them is Vivi?

118
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Let us handle those two!

119
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,140
Let's go, Mr. 4!

120
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,500
Special attack: Fire Star!!

121
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,930
Mr. 1, those two are breaking
off that way! That could be Vivi!

122
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,550
They're planning to go
in through the west gate.

123
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,430
Why, those...!

124
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,930
After them!

125
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,970
Un... deux!

126
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,190
Okay, we're going to the southwest gate!

127
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,150
They can try for three of
Alubarna's five gates from the west.

128
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,840
They're going to split up
and come in that way, huh?

129
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,310
Then we'll do the same!
We'll wipe them out inside!

130
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,990
You're not getting away!

131
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,540
Hey, someone's coming up! Is it the enemy?!

132
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,700
No, wait!

133
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,890
They're the Supersonic
Duck Squadron! Let them in!

134
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,920
There's no way you're getting away!

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,700
Thanks for following us all the way here.

136
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
What?!

137
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,740
Stop! Stop!

138
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,050
You guys have good instincts!
That's right, I'm Princess Vivi!

139
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,770
What are you talking--
er, talking about? I'm the real Vivi.

140
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,280
I wonder if this is far enough?

141
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,320
It's amusing how well you
folks have fallen for this.

142
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,700
Now...

143
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,210
Let us show you who we really are.

144
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,910
Too bad, you guessed wrong!

145
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,630
What?!

146
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,430
Thank you, everyone.

147
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,380
I have to hurry. The rebel army
is already just right over there.

148
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,370
Let's go, Karoo!

149
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,310
Vivi and Koza must not be
allowed to meet, no matter what.

150
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,750
A camel?!

151
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,990
And I know you from earlier!

152
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,720
S-Sorry!

153
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,910
Go on, Zoro! Let them have it!

154
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,550
You keep quiet!

155
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,390
They got us.

156
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,310
How much was that debt, again?

157
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,270
Quite the farce, huh?

158
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,940
You've already forgiven that!

159
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,770
There's not going to be a rebellion now.

160
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,370
What?!

161
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,240
I'll stop them, at any cost!

162
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,890
If I don't stop them now,
then this will all be for naught!

163
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,980
Secure those cannonballs!
I don't want them rolling away!

164
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,320
Artillerymen, maintain your posts!

165
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,760
Keep your cannonballs under tight control!

166
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,650
The ground is really rumbling, huh?

167
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,090
The enemy is a force of
two million angry men.

168
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,990
Even the earth shakes a little
before them. Do not shrink back!

169
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,920
It's okay, Karoo. You don't have to be here.

170
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,470
You could get trampled on.

171
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,060
Please, Leader, listen to what I have to say.

172
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,610
Everyone, stay together!
Charge through at the southern gate!

173
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,920
We'll knock out all the
others from the inside!

174
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,740
Make ready your resolve!

175
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,100
Stop, rebel army!

176
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,820
This fight is a set-up!

177
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
Please! Listen to me!

178
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,370
Rebel army! Stop!

179
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,470
Hey, did you see a person there just now?

180
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,300
A person? This is no time for nonsense!

181
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,090
Never mind that,
they're already shooting at us!

182
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,500
What was that for?!
There's no visibility now!

183
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,770
What kind of dumb move
was that, royal army?

184
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,030
You idiot! I haven't given
the order to fire yet!

185
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,360
Don't go acting on your own!

186
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,270
T-Terribly sorry about that!
My hand slipped, and it just happened.

187
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,820
Don't back down! Charge through!
It's just a cloud of sand!

188
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,270
No, everyone! Stop!

189
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,750
For the sake of our country!
Make the king pay!

190
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,430
Leader!

191
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,420
Leader!!

192
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,340
What's the matter, Koza?

193
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,290
It's nothing.

194
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,060
Was it my imagination?

195
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,200
Leader!

196
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,160
Remember, this is our final battle!

197
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,870
Wait! Listen to me!

198
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,840
Leader!!

199
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,930
Here they come!

200
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,750
Prepare to fire!

201
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,960
Bring down Alubarna!

202
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,710
Karoo...!

203
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,130
You... shielded me...

204
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:03,130
I'm so sorry... We've done so much...
but the rebellion has started...

205
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,910
I'm so sorry...

206
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,100
But still, I will stop it!

207
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,330
No matter how many times
I'm brushed aside,

208
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,980
I can't let something like this
make all we've done be for nothing...

209
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,690
That's something I learned...
aboard the ship...!

210
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,130
Not knowing when to quit!

211
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,410
Vivi!

212
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,230
So this is where you are!

213
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,590
Usopp-san!

214
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,360
We can still make it in time!
Hurry up and hop on!

215
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,050
Right! Hold on, Karoo...

216
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,020
That bird has had it!

217
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,490
We have to hurry! The rebellion
will only get worse! Hurry!

218
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,550
That... bird...?

219
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,550
Let's go, Karoo!

220
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,960
What's the matter? Hurry! This way!

221
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,560
Usopp-san, prove yourself.

222
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,020
Oh, you doubt who I am?

223
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,190
See?

224
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,480
It's not him!

225
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,920
Usopp! Hey, Usopp!

226
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,800
Lashes, wake up!

227
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,740
Oh, Sanji. Good morning.

228
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,460
Right.

229
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,000
Ah, how did our fight turn out?

230
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,110
The part of the mission where we
lured them away was successful.

231
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,090
And then...

232
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,690
It was over in two seconds.
One second each.

233
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,080
Couldn't you hold out a little longer?!

234
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,020
But Sanji, what are you doing here?

235
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,790
Your ducks came to get some
help for you! In any case...

236
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
You let Mr. 2 get away, didn't you?

237
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,400
Yes.

238
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,780
Listen up. That degenerate's
transformations are perfect.

239
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,710
There's no telling when he
might pose as one of us,

240
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,470
and make an attempt on Vivi's life.

241
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,900
If you feel that any of us is
acting the least bit suspicious,

242
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,500
take off this wrapping, and
show each other your marks.

243
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,330
If they can't do that, they're a fake.

244
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,030
Whoa, having a two-stage plan is
uncharacteristically smart of you.

245
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,330
So does that mean you're
that degenerate already?!

246
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,670
I'll cut you down!

247
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,780
Ah, that's Zoro.

248
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,250
Oh, it is Zoro?

249
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,680
You... are not Usopp-san!

250
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,610
Oh, dear...

251
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,690
I wonder what gave me away.

252
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,230
I thought I was perfect.

253
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,360
We got a report from Zero-chan

254
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,040
that you all had the same
mark wrapped up on you.

255
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,220
This is bad.

256
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,140
Vivi-chan is in danger!

257
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,850
I always wanted to talk about it

258
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,790
I couldn't even say half of it

259
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

260
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:55,650
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

261
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,020
Glory glory you're my shine

262
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,560
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

263
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,100
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

264
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,970
I'm sure I'll make it there

265
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,650
That bastard! If he hurts
Vivi-chan, he's gonna pay!

266
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,150
Chopper! Wake up!

267
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,130
Watch out! She's under the ground!

268
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,990
Look, just go find somewhere to hide!

269
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,870
I have to stop this!
I can't let myself die here!

270
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

271
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,690
"Alubarna Grieves!
The Fierce Captain Karoo!"

272
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,310
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
