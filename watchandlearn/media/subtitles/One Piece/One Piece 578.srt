00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

WE GO!

68
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,180
The Straw Hats have left the Fish-Man Island

69
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,940
and finally reached the New World.

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,020
They met a Giant girl named Lily
who ate the Mini-Mini Fruit

71
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,410
and decided to help her save her father

72
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,330
- Panz Fry from the Navy's ship. However,

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,680
a mysterious group called the Neo
Navy threw the situation into chaos.

74
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,470
After finally rescuing Panz Fry, Shuzo and

75
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,920
his clan are hot on the Straw Hats' tails!

76
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,760
Rescue mission accomplished!

77
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,510
Yeah!

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,790
Now, bring that food here!

79
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,250
I'll make them my heavenly food!

80
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,900
Really?! Thanks, frying pan pops!

81
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,740
Shuzo-san, I found them!
They're hiding behind a reef!

82
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,940
How annoying! All ships, prepare for battle!

83
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,120
Let's blow them up along with the reef!

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,590
I-I'm afraid we used up all our
torpedoes in the battle earlier

85
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,050
and we're almost out of bombshells too.

86
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,640
No, we still have a torpedo.

87
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,520
We can use this submersible as a torpedo!

88
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,720
We are the proud soldiers of
the Neo Navy's flying squad!

89
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,170
We trusted in Master Z and
Shuzo-san and got this far!

90
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,110
Shuzo-san! Let us fight with you! Please!!

91
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,480
I'm proud of you guys! I'll
care for you to your deathbed!

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,660
Fight to your heart's content
as a Neo Navy soldier!

93
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,630
All torpedoes, go!

94
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:59,820
"Z's Ambition! Luffy vs. Shuzo!"

95
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,820
--Pops!
--Dad!

96
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
What?! What?!

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,620
--It's them!
--I can't believe this!

98
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,840
Ch-Charge!

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,430
You bastard!

100
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,730
--That's not a torpedo!
--It's a manned ship, isn't it?

101
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,610
Long live the Neo Navy!

102
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,490
What's wrong with them?!

103
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,200
They're launching themselves like torpedoes!

104
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,500
They must be nuts!

105
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,960
Nice to see you again, accursed pirates.

106
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,250
You can't get away!

107
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,540
It's that guy! How did he find us?!

108
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,490
I used this!

109
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,840
A Vivre Card?!

110
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,890
When you were taking off,
I threw it onto the raft!

111
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,730
Ochenta Fleurs!

112
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,530
I won't allow them to die in vain!

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,480
He's super crazy!

114
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,460
You damn pirates are the reason
that the New World is corrupted.

115
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,050
So all we want is...

116
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,010
...to exterminate you all!

117
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,680
No! If you move too much, your wound will...

118
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,900
Iron Body!

119
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,320
Dad!

120
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,040
Lily!

121
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,080
No, stop!

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,050
You escaped death earlier!

123
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,190
But it's come for you again!

124
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,530
Dad!

125
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,560
I'll fight you!

126
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,040
--Luffy-sa!
--Go, Luffy!

127
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,210
I won't let you hurt that old man!

128
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,660
A rubber man? Oh right.

129
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,770
You're a pirate too and I'll
kill you sooner or later anyway.

130
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,750
Then why don't I kill you first? As you wish!

131
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,490
Gum-Gum...

132
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,960
...Jet Gatling!

133
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,120
Gum-Gum...

134
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,500
Finger Pistol!

135
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,840
...Jet Whip!

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,420
--Gum-Gum...
--Shave!

137
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,640
Moon Walk!

139
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,110
Armament!

Gum-Gum...

141
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,780
...Pistol!

142
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,100
--Yeah!
--He did it!

143
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,990
Iron Body!

144
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,510
Your Haki is not strong enough to beat me!

145
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,540
What?!

146
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,980
--He uses Haki as well, huh?
--This is going to be difficult.

147
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,780
His hands are annoying!

148
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,880
I guess that's all you got!

149
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,540
Third Gear!

150
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,130
Luffy!

151
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,060
You haven't collapsed yet?

152
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,330
How did you like the Haki-wrapped bombshell?

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,290
My lovely partner - Beast Cannon Alpacacino!

154
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,130
He's a bazooka that ate a Devil Fruit!

155
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,260
Finger Pistol Five!

156
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,480
Luffy!

157
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,240
I defeated your captain!

158
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,110
Luffy!

159
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,660
Luffy-san!

160
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,910
That bastard!

161
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,920
D-Don't do it!

162
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,350
Dad!

163
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,980
Usopp-sa, could you do me a favor?

164
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,600
Fling me into that guy's body!

165
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,420
What?!

166
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,530
I'll expand myself in his body
and break him into pieces!

167
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,160
Okay, I'll do it!

168
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,410
Ready?

169
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,570
Yeah!

170
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,410
Alright, go!

171
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,500
Luffy-sa! No!

172
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,350
Luffy-sa!

173
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,520
I knew your plan all along! So stupid!

174
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,820
All of you, go to hell!

175
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,770
H-Hey!

176
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,360
Not yet.

177
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,360
What?

178
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not over yet!

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,170
No way!

180
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,670
You fool!

181
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,680
I... I'm gonna kick your ass and...

182
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,890
...eat that old man's heavenly food!

183
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,360
Luffy-sa, here we go!

184
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,930
Whoa-whoa!

185
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,350
Oh wow!

186
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,940
It's super!

187
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,720
What's this? I got horns on my head!

188
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,060
What happened to you guys? You got smaller!

189
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,890
No, you got bigger, Luffy!

190
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,330
Lily slipped into your
body and expanded herself!

191
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,360
She did?!

192
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,550
That's right, Luffy-sa!

193
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,780
Oh, there you are!

194
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,910
I was wondering where your
voice was coming from!

195
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,450
Giant Luffy! How cool is that?

196
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,270
Yeah! I became a Giant!

197
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,730
How absurd! Even if you get bigger,

198
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,720
you're the same despicable pirate!

199
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,970
Oh, I forgot about you guys!

200
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,620
How could you?!

201
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,380
You bastard!

202
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,270
Don't get carried away!

203
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,080
Giants are too slow - I don't think
you can keep up with my speed!

204
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,100
Second Gear!

205
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,060
--Hey! What's going on?!
--It's a fast, hot wind!

206
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,370
You pirates are worthless!

207
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,250
And your worthlessness is no match for me!

208
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,760
Gum-Gum...

209
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,000
...Giant Jet...

210
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,500
Finger Pistol Ten!

211
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,990
...Spear!

212
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,910
Th-That was too much!

213
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,100
I almost died!

214
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,660
Luffy! Lily!

215
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,570
Thanks, Lily!

216
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,100
Don't mention it.

217
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,630
I'm so happy that I could help you!

218
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,160
Thank you, Luffy-sa!

219
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,270
All right! Now I can have
pops' heavenly food!

220
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,950
Uh-huh!

221
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,410
Th-The food is ruined!

222
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,510
You can't complain because you did it.

223
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,680
--Let's go.
--No! Food!

224
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,110
We'll get some food on our way and head

225
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,140
for a volcano somewhere. What do you say?

226
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,970
Sounds good.

227
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,050
All right! Let's go!

228
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,290
What should we do about his raft?

229
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,270
We can't load it on the ship.

230
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,860
--Seems like it's not a problem.
--Oh.

231
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,600
Super!

232
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,620
I think he made something.

233
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,500
The great shipwright - Franky! Thank you!

234
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,870
Don't mention it! Super!

235
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,640
You bastard! You survived?!

236
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,340
How did you find me?!

237
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,570
Like you did to the Straw Hats,

238
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,900
we secretly put this on Panz Fry's body.

239
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:48,200
It's a method of tracking pirates that
I learned from a teacher long ago.

240
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,040
It's inexcusable for you
to drag us Navy soldiers

241
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,780
in for the purpose of killing all pirates!

242
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,630
We'll take you all to Impel Down.

243
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,470
Impel Down?! No way!

244
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,670
We're not gonna tell you anything no matter

245
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,400
how much you torture us!

246
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,670
If you wanna kill us, just
do it here in the New World!

247
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,090
No, it's up to the law to decide.

248
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,170
That's how the Navy's justice works!

249
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,500
Luffy-sa! Everybody! Thank you!

250
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,830
I'll never forget what you did for us!

251
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,940
Don't make a big deal out of it.

252
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,680
See you! Thank you for the food!

253
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,850
Don't push yourself too
much, you heroic chef!

254
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,850
Yes, thank you! The great doctor - Chopper!

255
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,300
The great doctor? Me?

256
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,600
Compliments like that don't impress me!

257
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,480
Lily! Let's fight together again as Giants!

258
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,560
Uh-huh! You were the strongest
Giant I've ever known!

259
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,140
See you again!

260
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,570
All right, let's go!

261
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,210
Yeah!

262
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,990
What I feared most has happened.

263
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,060
SHUZO WILL BE PLACED IN IMPEL DOWN

264
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,390
I should have made myself clearer to him.

265
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm sorry!

266
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,070
Do you think the Navy found
out what we are up to?

267
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,720
Don't worry.

268
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,780
But...

269
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,790
They won't say anything no matter
how horrible the torture.

270
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,560
After all, isn't he a member
of our indomitable Neo Navy?

271
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,590
You're right.

272
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,970
Master Z. We will arrive
at the First Island soon.

273
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,110
Now, it's finally time to
fight! Let's terrify them all!

274
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,230
The last day of the New World is nigh.

275
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,280
We will kill all pirates
with our own bare hands!

276
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,470
As the Straw Hats sail the Maubeugemour Sea,

277
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,960
the first island of the New World appears before them.

278
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,130
As the crew marvels at its bizarre appearance,

279
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,600
they receive an emergency distress call

280
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,810
and then head toward the island.

281
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,730
But that will lead them into a battle larger than any they have ever faced!

282
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

283
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,730
"Arriving! A Burning Island - Punk Hazard!"

284
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
