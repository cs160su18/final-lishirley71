2
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,460
Well... you wanted to see me...
right, pirate lad?

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,920
I came to hear the truth!

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,590
Last night, I saw Nico Robin with my own eyes.

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,890
And... she is one of you.

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,390
That's the truth.

7
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,720
Was it really Robin?!

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,180
Don't say a word.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,850
Your words no longer mean anything.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,900
I called you in here...

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,110
...because I have a favor to ask.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,070
Let me see Nico Robin again now!

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,780
Extra! Extra!

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,710
The culprits for Mr. Iceberg's
attack were the Straw Hat pirates!

15
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,880
We, Water-Water Newspaper, will buy
any information on their sightings!

16
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,600
I'll say it again. Let me see Nico Robin.

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,230
That's not possible.

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,690
We don't know where she is.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,160
Gunfire!

20
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,450
It came from the bedroom!

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,330
Iceberg-san!

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,010
Y-You're okay...

23
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,140
Yeah...

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,640
I bet on a silly hope that I might
be able to get closer to the truth.

25
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,100
Capture... all the Straw Hats!

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,860
Of course!

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,900
Hey, Luffy...

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,490
Were you able to talk to
Iceberg-san by any chance?

29
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,700
Yeah. He said he really saw Robin.

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,500
Can't be...! Why would Robin
do something like that?

31
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,830
I refuse to believe it!

32
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,130
It's all right! Now let's move forward

33
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,640
with the sun always in our hearts

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,970
As power passes through our clasped hands

35
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,640
let's grab hold of our wishes

36
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:05,620
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

37
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,920
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,880
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:27,010
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

40
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,430
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

41
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,360
but what you cherish most will be right there

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,360
And if you get into a jam

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,450
I'll always be there to protect you

44
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,570
It's all right! Now let's move forward

45
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,120
with the sun always in our hearts

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,160
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,420
and gaze at the light beyond

48
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,340
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,630
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

50
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,600
So let's grab hold of our wishes

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,350
under the same flag-- together, we're one

52
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,020
One Piece

53
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:31,080
"Eternal Farewell? Nico Robin,
the Woman Who Draws Darkness"

54
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,580
We're here! We're here!
Grandma Kokoro! Hurry! Hurry!

55
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,590
Don't get carried away.

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Water Seven... It's been a while...

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,640
Grandma! Hurry! Hurry!

58
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,970
Okay, okay.

59
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,140
Wearing a mask is prohibited today
when you get on board the sea train.

60
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,110
Please show me your ticket and your face.

61
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,070
This is my own face! My own face!

62
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
Hm?

63
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,190
Hey, you...

64
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,070
Oh! Kokoro-san! Hello!

65
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,780
What's all the fuss about?

66
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,160
Yes... We're after the
Straw Hats who're the culprits

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
in Iceberg-san's attempted assassination.

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,960
Iceberg's assassination? Hm?

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,000
What's the matter? Ah...

70
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,920
These people...

71
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,220
N... Nooo!!

72
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,310
I'm falling! I'm falling!

73
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm falling!

74
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,160
All right! We've landed!

75
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,740
Boy, I'm exhausted.

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,660
Don't "We've landed" me! I thought I'd die!

77
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,920
What else could we have done?!

78
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,330
It was you who said that
we couldn't use the elevator

79
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,130
because we didn't want them to find us!

80
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,510
Even so, you didn't have to jump off!

81
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,920
We're not that shipwright with a square nose!

82
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,550
I... I'm sorry.

83
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,430
Well, fine. At least it did get us down.

84
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,760
If it was okay, then don't hit me!

85
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,400
But... this may be kinda bad.

86
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,440
Bad? What's bad?

87
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,900
This island's geography and the weather.

88
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,240
With this much wind blowing,
if the atmospheric pressure drops,

89
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,280
a typhoon might come through here tonight.

90
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,410
This town is called the City of Water.

91
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,790
In other words, it can be a weak point
that could easily lead to flood damage.

92
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,920
So? What about it?

93
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,130
Well... It bothers me a little,
so I'll check into it later.

94
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,800
Anyway, let's go back to the inn.

95
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,320
Oh, welcome.

96
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,410
Yow! How's it going, Blueno?!

97
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,120
Is it going super?!

98
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,120
I think we're doing good.

99
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,290
What do you mean, "I think"?!
You sure are an indecisive guy!

100
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,050
Give me the usual! Fill them up!

101
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,670
You got money?

102
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,300
Just refill them! Cola!

103
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,970
To think that you run a bar
with such a stingy notion

104
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,890
that you take money from your customers...!

105
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,640
We've got money.

106
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,850
We've got a million Berries
left over from shopping.

107
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,060
What?!

108
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,650
We've got that much money from yesterday?!

109
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,150
How shameful! How uncool!

110
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,400
To think that I didn't spend it all yesterday...!

111
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,450
Now, give it to me!

112
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,200
Yow! You guys! You're lucky!

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,830
All your alcohol is on me!

114
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,750
Drink as much as you like!

115
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,670
Whoa! That's our Franky! You're generous!

116
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,880
You're the man! The face of the
Water Seven underworld! Thanks!

117
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,130
Whoa! Awesome!

118
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,840
Hey, there's more on the floor over there!

119
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,060
Hey, Blueno! Where's my cola?!

120
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,470
Hurry up, already!

121
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,350
Looks like you're doing well, Franky.

122
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,100
Hm?

123
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,940
Old hag Kokoro! That was you?!

124
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,530
I thought it was a statue of a monster!

125
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,030
Hey, is it okay to get a
refill for my juice, Franky?!

126
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,960
This is a bar. It's not a place for kids!

127
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,670
You're doing well, right?

128
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,920
Huh?! Okay, then. Suit yourself.

129
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,420
All right! Juice!

130
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,550
Well, I'm doing well, but I'm
feeling gloomy. I feel terrible.

131
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,010
I'm feeling terrible this week,
thanks to that damn pirate!

132
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,890
Here's the refilled cola! Thanks for waiting!

133
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,430
Yeah, took you long enough!

134
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,140
Fuel! Fuel!

135
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,780
Here it comes! Here it comes! Oh, yeah!

136
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,670
Super!

137
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,010
I've revived! That jerk! Next time
I see him, I'll beat him up!

138
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,170
By the way, old hag, why are you here?

139
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,800
Aqua Laguna is coming.

140
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh? Is that right? No wonder the wind is strong.

141
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,430
Are you done getting your house ready?

142
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,810
Well, my house is gone.

143
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,400
I've got nothing that could sink,
so I have no worries.

144
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,070
I was going to have a drink with Iceberg,
but I heard he got shot.

145
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,950
Yeah, sounds like it.

146
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,620
They say it was the pirates' doing.

147
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,290
Galley-La and the townspeople
are furious right now.

148
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,960
Pirates' doing?

149
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,300
Do you seriously think that's the case?

150
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,710
You sound like you know something.

151
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,970
Don't say whatever comes to mind, old hag.

152
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,800
Iceberg has been getting nagged all this
time by the World Government, right?

153
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,850
Huh? Then, what? Are you saying
that official, Corgy, did it?

154
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,020
That tubby isn't an assassin type!

155
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,190
No... Shadowy incidents are the work of CP9.

156
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,990
Do you know about it, Blueno?

157
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,030
Just heard some rumors.

158
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:46,450
Geez... Common folk sure do like to believe
rumors of things like nonexistent organizations.

159
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,660
How foolish... It does exist.

160
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,170
But they never show themselves, since their
unit works secretly in the shadows.

161
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,100
Where's that confidence coming from?
Do you know something?

162
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,640
I heard about it over there.

163
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,350
Hey, that's just a rumor, then!
Don't mess with--

164
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,940
It always being a rumor is the scary part.

165
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,860
They eliminate people without anyone noticing.

166
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,660
If you meddle with them, you're dead meat.

167
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,460
Thanks. The job we had
to do yesterday went well.

168
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,460
Well done, Nico Robin...

169
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,930
That was a piece of cake.

170
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,890
Although naturally you're now
being pursued by the whole town.

171
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,730
Yeah.

172
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,350
But that's just temporary.

173
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,060
What's important is... tonight.

174
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,650
We'll infiltrate Iceberg's
residence one more time.

175
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,950
If worst comes to worst, it's okay
to eliminate all the evidence.

176
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,080
Among the disciples of this
Tom guy who originally had it,

177
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,830
Iceberg is the only one currently alive.

178
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,750
No matter how much he plays innocent,

179
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,590
in the name of CP9, we'll take
it away tonight for sure.

180
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,220
Bear in mind that this is a mission for justice.

181
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,950
Following the Aqua Laguna warning
issued for the entire island,

182
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,950
all the shipbuilding factory docks
on the shipbuilding island

183
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,120
will be opened as evacuation centers.

184
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,340
Large crowds are expected,
so please evacuate ahead of time.

185
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,010
In addition, since Dock #1 is
currently in a dangerous state...

186
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,510
Okay, I'll put the iron board on.

187
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,010
You guys have everything you need?

188
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,930
Yes, we do. Let's evacuate to the shipyard.

189
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,520
Daddy, hurry up!

190
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,060
Hurry up!

191
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,980
Well, hold on a bit. I'd better
fill the gap good with hempen.

192
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,190
If the inside of our house gets flooded,
everything will be ruined.

193
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,280
Hey, tie that side, too!

194
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,490
Hey, the wind is starting to get strong!
Get ready for waves soon!

195
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,670
Guys! If we're taking our time,
assassin pirates will show up too this time!

196
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,670
That's scary!

197
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,040
Where did he disappear to?!

198
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,590
I'm pretty sure he came this way.

199
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,590
He should still be around!

200
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,300
Okay, you guys go search over there.

201
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,510
Got it!

202
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,350
What the hell is going on?

203
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,650
Why am I being chased after? I don't get it!

204
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,490
So this is the reason they've
been chasing after me!

205
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Assassination culprits?

206
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,120
This bites. I can't even go
back to the inn like this.

207
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,750
Ah... Who is it over there?!

208
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,960
This way! I found a suspicious guy here!

209
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,500
Are you sure, landlord?

210
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,300
Yes. Those pirates have been
staying at this inn since last night.

211
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,930
They were there until just a bit ago.

212
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,550
They were here?!

213
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,970
Yes. Since they've still got a
lot of luggage in their room,

214
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,520
they might come back.

215
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,600
Okay, then! You guys, stay here.

216
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,980
The rest of you, let's go
search this area together!

217
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,070
Listen, make sure you leave
no stone unturned to find them!

218
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,280
Yeah!

219
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,040
Hey, there's no one here!

220
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,050
Is this really their ship?

221
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,710
There's no mistake about it! Look!

222
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,800
That's the Straw Hats' pirate flag.

223
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,510
I bet they've already abandoned it.

224
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,680
This ship is all beat up.

225
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,100
How was it? Did you find them?

226
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,230
No, they aren't here!

227
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,480
There isn't much stuff left inside the ship.
This ship definitely is abandoned.

228
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Let's go look someplace else.

229
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,830
Who were they?

230
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,670
Is something happening in town?

231
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,300
--Did you find them?
--No.

232
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,430
Dammit! Where are they?!

233
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,810
Hey, Luffy.

234
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,310
Hm? What is it, Nami?

235
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,310
Do you think everyone's okay?

236
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,610
Craftsmen are everywhere in town.

237
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,780
I think Chopper and Sanji-kun are okay,
since their faces are still unknown, but...

238
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,660
At any rate, let's hurry!

239
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,780
Yeah.

240
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,870
The sea train is still in service...

241
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,620
Looks like the afternoon train has already left,

242
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,130
but there's another one that
departs at night in this bad weather?

243
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,760
11 PM, leaving for Enies Lobby...
The sea train is pretty impressive.

244
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,640
Hey! Any information on the pirates?!

245
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,260
No. We've got nothing.

246
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,520
If we capture even one of those three
whose faces are known and squeeze him,

247
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,140
the rest of the gang will be identified.

248
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,440
Hurry up! Before the waves get high!

249
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,070
I wonder if Robin got on the sea train.

250
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,650
If she did, things can't get any worse.

251
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,200
When Water Seven is
already too big to handle...

252
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,700
I wonder if... I did something
to upset her at the bookstore.

253
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,660
You dummy... There's no way that's the case.

254
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,910
Oh, hey, excuse me.

255
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,580
Have you seen a pretty woman like her?

256
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,920
Oh, that... The pretty woman who's 20
years older than in that picture, right?

257
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,970
If I had, I would've told either the paper
company or Galley-La immediately.

258
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,340
But to think she's an assassin...
What a surprise, huh?

259
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,810
Well, it's fine if you wanna look for
the culprits, but you should evacuate soon.

260
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,850
Or you'll be swallowed by Aqua Laguna.

261
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,350
Well then, see ya.

262
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,360
Things are going wrong for all of us, too...

263
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,950
I wonder if Luffy and the others are okay.

264
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,410
Luffy's fine. The one I'm
worried about is Nami-san.

265
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,420
At any rate, the town is becoming quite empty.

266
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,090
The wind is gradually getting stronger, too.
People have started evacuating.

267
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,050
Dammit...

268
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,260
Hey, Robin-chan! Where'd you go?!

269
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,350
This scent... Could it be...?

270
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,480
Chopper, what's the matter?!

271
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,440
Hey, Chopper?!

272
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,610
Hey! Wait!

273
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
It's close!

274
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,700
Hey! I said wait! What's the matter?!

275
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,660
She's here.

276
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,870
Hey, Chopper! Chopper!

277
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,750
Whoa! Oops!

278
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,340
H-Hey, are you okay?!

279
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,220
Chopper! Are you okay?!

280
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,180
Are you hurt?

281
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,140
Geez, don't be reckless!
What on earth is going on...

282
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,980
Starting to run so sudden... ly...

283
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,690
I knew she'd be here.

284
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,070
--Robin!
--Robin-chan!

285
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,780
Wh-Where have you been?!
We looked all over for you!

286
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,530
Everyone's worried about you!
Now, let's go back to the inn together.

287
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,040
Well, a lot has happened while you've
been gone. I'll explain in detail.

288
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,750
But this distance is annoying.

289
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,750
Hold on! I'll be right over there!

290
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,670
No, that's okay. Stay there.

291
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,380
What?

292
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,350
I won't... return to you guys.

293
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,770
We're parting ways here... in this town...

294
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,100
Wh-What're you saying, Robin-chan?

295
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Oh, I get it. You're thinking about the
newspaper, right? Don't worry about it!

296
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,200
None of us believe it,

297
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,820
and being falsely accused of a
crime often happens to pirates!

298
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,780
Yeah...

299
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,450
I'm sorry for pinning an
unreasonable crime on you guys.

300
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,370
But the article is telling the truth.

301
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,000
It really was me who infiltrated
the mayor's residence last night.

302
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,840
What?

303
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,840
No...

304
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,800
I carry a darkness within me
that you guys don't know about.

305
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,930
This darkness will destroy you someday.

306
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,400
The organizations Nico Robin had
something to do with up until today

307
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,940
all got annihilated... except for her.

308
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,660
As a matter of fact, I'm pinning this
crime on you and planning to run away.

309
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,950
The situation will get worse.

310
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,370
What do you mean?! Why are you--

311
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,250
Why I'm doing it... It's something
you don't need to know.

312
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,920
Robin-chan! I don't get what you're saying!
What happened to you?!

313
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,630
Robin! Let's go back together!

314
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,600
Although I only spent a short
time with you, after today...

315
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,310
...I'll never see you again.

316
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,270
Thank you for being nice to a person like me.

317
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,230
Goodbye.

318
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,840
Wait...

319
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,930
Hey... wait...

320
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,930
I can't...

321
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,100
...accept this.

322
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,150
Hey...

323
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,770
Wait!

324
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,650
Stop joking!

325
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,400
Wait! Robin-chan!

326
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,360
Robin-chan!

327
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,740
Wait! Robin-chan! Robin-chan!

328
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,840
Robin!

329
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

330
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

331
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

332
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

333
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

334
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

335
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

336
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

337
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

338
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

339
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

340
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

341
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

342
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

343
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

344
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

345
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

346
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,300
Isn't it time to settle
whether Robin is friend or foe?

347
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,970
Hold on a sec!

348
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,760
She's suddenly changed because
of the masked man she was with!

349
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,600
That's right! That man is
making her do bad things!

350
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
That would be fortune.

351
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,100
If this guy is Robin's real friend,
then that would be misfortune.

352
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

353
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,730
"Capture Robin!
The Determination of the Straw Hats"

354
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
