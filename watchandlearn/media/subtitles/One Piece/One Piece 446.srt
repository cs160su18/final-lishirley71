2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,110
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,160
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,000
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,030
Now with Jimbei and Crocodile,
they're battling on level 4!

53
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,690
This is the great fort
of hell! No one may pass!

54
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,490
"No Price Too High! Serious Hannyabal!"

55
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,030
Who is that?! Why did he
open the door so wide?!

56
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,310
He is Hannyabal - the vice
warden of this prison!

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,610
Shoot!

58
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,670
Look!

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,590
We have a thousand Cage Shot bazooka
troops on the stairway to level 3!

60
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,560
There's no way out for you guys!

61
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,860
--Vice Warden got all fired up!
--Maybe somebody's posing as him again!

62
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,720
This is for the bright future
of all innocent people!

63
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,890
You, the worst pirate in
the history, Straw Hat!

64
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,150
I impose the death penalty on
you on the Warden's behalf!

65
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,610
He's really out of character!

66
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,050
Outta my way!

67
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,410
No way!

68
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,790
Outta my way!

69
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,050
I can't believe it!

70
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,800
Hey! Look at that halberd!

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,180
That's the Bloodsucker!

72
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
You bastard!

73
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,690
Don't underestimate me!

74
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,980
--Looks like he's serious!
--Then we can depend on him because he's strong!

75
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:34,120
Hannya! Hannya! Hannya! Hannya!

76
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,330
W-What's going on here?

77
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,800
As you may know, it's the Hannya
Hustle Dance: Inferno Hell Wheel!

78
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,930
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

79
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,340
If you don't move, I'll move
you myself! I gotta save Ace!

80
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,520
That's hilarious!

81
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,980
If I moved away that easily,
I wouldn't be the vice warden!

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,540
Second Gear!

83
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,960
Gum-Gum...

84
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,670
...Jet...

85
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,550
...Gatling!

86
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,200
We've been waiting for you!

87
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,320
Warden Magellan, please hurry!

88
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,050
Where are the ringleaders?!

89
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,300
In front of the staircase to level 3!

90
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,720
That's the opposite side of
this floor! We have to hurry!

91
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,560
Vice Warden Hannyabal and the others are
managing to keep them there for now!

92
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,770
Vice Warden!

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,740
That was too easy! I'm not
a very good vice warden!

94
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,840
If he were here...

95
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,830
THE WARDEN'S OFFICE
20 YEARS AGO

96
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,200
T-This is my first day as a jailer!

97
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,040
My name is Hannyabal!

98
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,110
You look like a viper as they say.

99
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,550
What?! No! That hurts!

100
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,720
You're the only person who can
look out for him as I thought.

101
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,350
Magellan!

102
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,350
I got it, sir!

103
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,030
Damn Magellan!

104
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,380
Why should I be assigned to level 1?

105
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,920
On top of that,

106
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,110
I'm only in charge of
the security check for new prisoners!

107
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,590
--The next one has come!
--Oh, okay!

108
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,520
She has a 50 million berry
bounty. A pirate--Ms. Olive!

109
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,190
She's a vicious criminal!
Take extra care with her!

110
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
She's so my type! Oops, I
shouldn't have said that!

111
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,640
He was so easy! Like all other men!

112
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,060
I gotta strip all my clothes off, right?

113
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,560
It's embarrassing,
so can you turn away?

114
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,610
S-Sure!

115
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,650
Are you ready yet?

116
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,650
Not yet!

117
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,860
How foolish is he?

118
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,410
Quite.

119
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,560
L-Let me go!

120
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,630
Don't let your guard down!

121
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,540
Ouch!

122
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,130
It doesn't matter if it's level 1 or
6! All duties are equally important!

123
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,800
You gotta keep in mind what's going
to happen if any one person fails!

124
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,360
Let me go!

125
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,320
It's not over yet!

126
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,590
You can't go through here!

127
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,810
Follow the Vice Warden! Don't hold back!

128
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,190
Bring it on!

129
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,710
Outta my way!

130
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm gonna save Ace!

131
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,300
So what?! It's not over yet!

132
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,880
Outta my way!

133
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,440
You...

134
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,730
You can't go through here!

135
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,480
Gum-Gum...

136
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,900
...Jet Stamp!

137
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,040
Stop!

138
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,700
Quit bothering me!

139
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,920
Dammit! I have to hurry to make it on time!

140
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,720
You can't go through here!

141
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,200
You're the King of Diarrhea!

142
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,530
Why don't you wear a toilet
seat instead of your hat?!

143
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,970
He's been cussing for more than 30 minutes!

144
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,360
That's our Captain Buggy!

145
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,160
Your mom's got an outie belly button!

146
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,990
I don't have anything more to say!

147
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,790
I can't ad-lib anything else!

148
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
A-Are you alright?

149
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,960
Magellan's kind of tough, huh?
Let me just go to the bathroom!

150
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,840
D-Don't tell us...

151
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,720
...that you got diarrhea, Captain Buggy?!

152
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,140
No, I just wanna pee! Ha!

153
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,570
Then, we'll go with you!

154
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,070
What should I do?!

155
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,190
If nothing happens,

156
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,520
we can't break out and
my reputation will be ruined!

157
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,120
I gotta come up with something!

158
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,150
What shitty fortifications!

159
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,570
That didn't help them avoid their destiny!

160
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,360
Liberation!

161
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,480
That's a long leak!

162
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,560
You gotta hear this, Captain Buggy!

163
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,190
What's wrong?

164
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,320
The wall...

165
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,690
...is gone!

166
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,160
What did you just say?!

167
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,120
W-What happened?!

168
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,040
The block of poison's really gone!

169
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,130
My attack finally worked!

170
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,630
What a pain in the butt!

171
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,090
So you were really fighting the
venom with your venomous tongue!

172
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,800
Was the peeing part of it?!

173
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,680
Cool! I knew that you were in another league!

174
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,560
Oh no. This doesn't make sense at all.

175
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,550
Alright! The block is gone now!

176
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,610
Come and follow my lead, you guys!

177
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,280
Stop bothering me!
Get out of my way!

178
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
No, I won't!

179
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
--I said "Outta my way!"
--I won't let you go a single step!

180
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
There's no time!

181
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,380
I said "Outta my way!"

182
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,800
I... I gotta save Ace!

183
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,670
"Wanna save my brother?"

184
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,730
You're the dreg of society
so just cut the crap!

185
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,120
You guys are all pirates and
rebels who earn only infamy!

186
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,250
--Vice Warden Hannyabal!
--Don't stand up! You're gonna die!

187
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,960
With you on the seas,

188
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,340
people can't even sleep at night from
fear of losing their loved ones!

189
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:38,720
That's why we lock up all the vicious
criminals to make them feel safe!

190
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,520
This is the great fort of hell!

191
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,020
If we let prisoners out of here, the
world will be filled with terror!

192
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,330
So as I said, I won't let you take...

193
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,080
...even a single step!

194
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,200
Vice Warden!

195
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,470
The only thing I care about
is saving Ace! So just move!

196
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,680
You're too stupid to understand...

197
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,580
V-Vice Warden, help me!

198
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,820
Hey, what's the matter, you guys?!

199
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Cut it out!

200
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,160
All this arguing about right and wrong!

201
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,370
Search the ends of the earth,

202
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,620
and you'd find no answer!

203
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,080
So, cut the crap!

204
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,930
I met him at Jaya!

205
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,780
Wow! Wow!

206
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,660
How interesting to see
all these faces at once!

207
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,580
Looks like you were in middle of something!

208
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,710
Teech! Why the hell are you here?!

209
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,590
Or should I call you Blackbeard now?

210
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,620
Jimbei!

211
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,890
Hey, that's not nice! Why
don't you loosen your fist?!

212
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,320
Oh yeah! You're close to Ace, aren't you?

213
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,570
But you're barking up the wrong tree!

214
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,030
Blackbeard!

215
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,420
I'm chasing a certain man.

216
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,620
His name is Blackbeard.

217
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,400
People's dreams...

218
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,920
...have no end!

219
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,550
I heard a pirate called Blackbeard...

220
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,430
...became a Warlord by
defeating "Fire Fist" Ace.

221
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,140
Blackbeard...

222
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,600
So you're...

223
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,480
You're...

224
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,460
...Blackbeard?!

225
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,490
Huh? Oh yeah, I never gave you my name.

226
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,240
Long time no see, Straw Hat!

227
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,880
I was surprised, too, when I heard
you were my commander's brother!

228
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,170
Are you sure you want to be
here? You're gonna miss it!

229
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,520
Your brother's public execution!

230
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,690
I found out later that the
former Warlord right there...

231
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,440
...Crocodile was defeated
by you, Straw Hat Luffy!

232
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,570
At that time, I was trying to
take his place as a Warlord so...

233
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,990
...killing you was the most effective way
to show my ability to the Government!

234
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,260
Teech, let's cut the idle talk!

235
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,760
You should know the rules, having
lived through twice as much as others.

236
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,430
Whitebeard's reign is over! I'll
become the next Pirate King!

237
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,640
For starters, I'm gonna kill Straw Hat
Luffy who is in the Water Seven...

238
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,060
...as a gift to the Government!

239
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,320
Luffy? What did you just say?

240
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,380
Oh! You know him?!

241
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,530
Another reason I can't let you go free!

242
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,370
He's my brother!

243
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,040
But fate has saved you instead!

244
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,590
Ace who has been chasing after me for
the crime on Whitebeard's ship...

245
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,050
...happens to be your brother!

246
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,340
When he faced us - we, who were
going to kill his brother -

247
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,850
he had his retreat cut off!

248
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,270
If I yield to power, there's
no point in being born a man.

249
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,230
I'll never leave anything to
be regretted later in my life!

250
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,320
Do you understand, stupid?

251
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,120
The sun or the darkness -
there'll be only one winner!

252
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm gonna make Whitebeard the king!

253
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,840
Do you get it?

254
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,770
If he let us get away, not only
would it disgrace Whitebeard's name

255
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,060
but he'd allow his brother's death!

256
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,320
There's no coincidence in fate! That means...

257
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,570
Yeah! You're so lucky! Burp...

258
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,160
Our captain became the
Warlord and made his name

259
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,660
so you're useless to us now!

260
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,750
Your brother fought bravely!

261
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,170
Pay your respects at his grave!

262
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,510
If it weren't for him,
you'd be the one who...

263
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,220
...would've been killed, Straw Hat!

264
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,220
Then why don't you...

265
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,690
...try to kill me now?!

266
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,990
Gum-Gum...

267
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,240
...Jet...

268
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,430
...Pistol!

269
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,340
While attempting to escape during the choas,
Luffy is confronted by Blackbeard.

270
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,350
Blackbeard tells of his involvement
in arranging Ace's execution.

271
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,600
After hearing this, Luffy fights him out of anger.

272
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

273
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,230
"Jet Pistol of Anger! Luffy vs. Blackbeard!"

274
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
