00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,890
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,750
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,190
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,450
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,450
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,530
--What does Gonbe's "Go" mean?
--Hey, pops. Give me that water-water candy.

35
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,440
Here you go, thanks!

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,930
Mister!

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,710
--What does Sanji's "Sa" mean?
--The barbecue last night was the best!

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,450
--Yeah.
--And you have a good eye for food, too!

39
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,100
Yeah, I'm a first-class cook, so... See you, then.

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,780
See you later, pops!

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,910
See you!

42
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,450
Ah! I see pirate ladies!

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,250
What?! Whoa!

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,250
Nami-san!

45
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,340
Please tell us how you two
joined the Straw Hat Pirates!

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,930
--Robin-chan! Mellorine!
--Please tell us everything there is to
know about the beautiful female pirates!

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,770
I can't really talk about
personal things like that.

48
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,090
We aren't going to get
much shopping done like this.

49
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,160
What type of men do you like?

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,140
Let's see...

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,980
Nami-san might say that
"Sanji-kun is my type"...!

52
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,150
--I wonder what the cook guy's doing...
--Nami-san! I love you, too!

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,170
How would you two feel about putting
out a swimsuit photo book with us?

54
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,490
What? Swimsuit?!

55
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,690
There's no doubt that it'll be a best seller!

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,000
Hey, you. You've got some guts!

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,170
Oh, I-I'm sorry!

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,050
I'll cost you a fortune.
So how much can you pay?

59
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,590
Huh?

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,760
Are you serious?

61
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,420
Sure, since Luffy used most
of that 100 million Berries,

62
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,460
we need to earn money through
photo books or whatever else we can.

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,040
Hold on a sec...

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,810
A swimsuit photo book of Nami-san
and Robin-chan would have...

65
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,190
...pics like this...

66
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,650
...and like this...

67
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,820
Hey! What were you guys
just fantasizing about?!

68
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,090
Whoa! This guy is the Straw Hats' cook!

69
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,030
Sanji-kun!

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,790
I'm gonna kill every single one of you
who just had a lewd look on your face!

71
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,020
Nami-san. Robin-chan.

72
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,920
I drove those damn noisy
flies away, so please rest easy.

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,180
Thanks, Sanji-kun. Now we can
do our shopping in peace.

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,140
This is my chance for a date. On top of that,
I'll be between two pretty women!

75
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,890
By the way, about today's schedule,
how does this sound?

76
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,470
The three of us will rent a pool

77
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,410
--Cook guy!
--and have a nice date on the water.
And then we'll go to a nice restaurant.

78
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,500
What?!

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,110
I'm hungry!

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,120
You just ate some water-water candy!

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,330
Okay, then. I'll give you some money,
so you guys buy some food and go home.

83
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,420
I might go out on a date with them,
so don't be so whiny!

84
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,880
I don't wanna go home yet!

85
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,300
Crying won't get you anywhere!

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,630
Don't worry, Chimney.

87
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,970
Sanji-kun has a harsh tongue,
but he's very nice to women.

88
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,220
That's right. He isn't someone
who'd overlook a lady in need.

89
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,180
Nami-san... Robin-chan...

90
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,610
Chimney, have Sanji-kun play
with you to your heart's content.

91
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,420
Yep!

92
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,150
Well, then...

93
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,020
Oh, no!

94
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,450
Seriously... you're the
very example of a burden.

95
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,410
I guess it can't be helped.

96
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,370
So... do you know a place
that serves good food?

97
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,340
All right!

98
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,790
--Now, let's go.
--Okay!

99
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,740
"Sanji's Shock! Mysterious Old Man
and His Super Yummy Cooking!"

100
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,460
Are you really sure there's a place that
serves good food in a place like this?

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,060
Yep! Grandma's friend is running it.

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,480
Granny Kokoro's friend?

103
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,830
Your dishes taste good, too, but Gramps
Bang-Bang's dishes are tastier!

104
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,720
Oh, is that right?

105
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,430
Oh, it's right after we go down those stairs.

106
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,630
Seriously, that food was awful.

107
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,950
I can't believe someone
said this place was good.

108
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,380
I thought I was finally gonna have a
decent meal after getting off the ship...

109
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,380
Hey, hey...

110
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,860
This way!

111
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,010
Hey, Gramps Bang-Bang!
Cook something for me!

112
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,710
Hey, is this drunk old man really a cook?

113
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,830
I'm hungry! Wake up!

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,260
Oh, leave him alone.

115
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,690
I've got some foodstuffs, so I'll cook for you.

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,690
This kitchen is unexpectedly well organized.

117
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

118
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,260
He uses a fanatical kitchen knife!

119
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,080
It's well taken care of, too.

120
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,870
Let's see...

121
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,370
Oh, this is it.

122
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,570
Sorry, gramps! I'm borrowing your kitchen.

123
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,360
Good morning, Gramps Bang-Bang!

124
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,240
Hey, where'd you learn how
to use that kitchen knife?

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,560
Ah, at a restaurant I used
to work at called Baratie.

126
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,080
Here you go. It's done.

127
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,770
All right! Thanks!

128
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,460
Yummy!

129
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,960
Are you Zeff's apprentice?

130
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,870
What?! You know that damn geezer, gramps?!

131
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,050
Besides me, that lad Zeff is the only
one who uses that kitchen knife.

132
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,270
"Lad"?! That damn geezer used
to be the captain of a pirate group!

133
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,320
Ha! From my perspective, everyone's a lad!

134
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,280
So, what're you doing in Water Seven?

135
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,740
Were you kicked out of Zeff's restaurant?

136
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,280
It's not like that. I left there
in order to go to the All Blue.

137
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,490
All Blue, you said?

138
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,490
Yeah, a legendary sea that's said to
have the world's best foodstuffs...

139
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,380
It's a miracle sea.

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,840
I became a pirate in order to go there.

141
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah, I get it. You, too, are gonna
tell me that sea is just a legend, right?

142
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,260
The All Blue does exist.

143
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,340
It's a sea that any skilled cook
would dream of visiting at least once.

144
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,470
But it's definitely a place one can't
reach with halfhearted determination.

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,870
Many cooks have taken up
the challenge to go there

146
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,320
but ended up giving up on their dreams
without ever seeing that miracle.

147
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,160
It's a cruel sea.

148
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,790
Good heavens...!

149
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,340
So it really isn't just a legend?!

150
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,080
Could it possibly be... that you've
been to the All Blue, gramps?!

151
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,510
--Nope.
--You haven't?!

152
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,050
What I was watching just now
was a picture from my early days!

153
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,890
Don't act misleading!
Geez, what a cheeky old man.

154
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,180
Hm? I ran out of booze.

155
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,190
Thank you! That was good!

156
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,520
This is in return for you letting
me use your cooking tools.

157
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
Thanks!

158
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,190
Hey, we're going back now.

159
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,000
What? I wanna eat more.

160
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,740
You guys have been eating too much!

161
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,330
Well, wait, lad.

162
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,580
As thanks for the booze,
eat my food before you go.

163
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,120
Oh, don't worry about it.

164
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,250
I wanna eat it!

165
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,090
You're still young. Don't be so modest.

166
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,460
Hey, are you okay?

167
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,590
Lad, say that line after
you see my cooking skill...

168
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,310
See, what did I tell you?

169
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,920
Oh, yeah, we've got a good doctor,
so I'll introduce you to...

170
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,020
You fixed it yourself?!

171
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,350
Oops!

172
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,190
Is this old man serious?

173
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,460
Hey, gramps, you don't have to
push yourself. If you like, I can...

174
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,290
Don't panic, lad!

175
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,380
H-Huh? Me?

176
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,130
Sit there quietly and watch!

177
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,840
Okay, okay, I got it, I'll watch.

178
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,760
Hey, hey, his hand's shaking...

179
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,480
Hey, he's cutting them in a way
that makes use of his shaking hand.

180
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,870
Hm? He's adept for a drunk person.

181
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,610
Here you go!

182
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,630
Yaay!

183
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,940
Thank you!

184
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,850
Yummy!

185
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,270
He was indeed adept, but...

186
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,770
...any way you look at it,
it's just plain old fried rice.

187
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,650
What's the matter, lad?
Aren't you gonna eat it?

188
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,450
I have a policy of eating everything
served to me. So I'll gratefully eat it.

189
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,500
This is super damn good!

190
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,950
The way he cooked was nothing special.
No difference in the foodstuffs, either.

191
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,130
And yet, why is this flavor so deep?!

192
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,500
It's damn good!

193
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,930
What, was it so good that
it made you shake, lad?

194
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,450
Thanks! It was yummy!

195
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,720
S-Something like that.

196
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,600
So do you know why it was so good?

197
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,060
No, I don't.

198
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,030
It seems you're somewhat
confident in your ability,

199
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,740
but if you can't figure out something like that,

200
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,740
the All Blue will just be
an unfulfilled dream for you.

201
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,450
Chimney! Gonbe!

202
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,490
Stay here for a bit, will you?

203
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,610
Sure.

204
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,540
I'm gonna reveal the secret of gramps' flavor!

205
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,510
It's not how he cooks or the foodstuffs he uses.

206
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,010
In that case, that's the only decisive factor!

207
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,320
Oh, hey! You're the cook guy in the
Straw Hats. Looking for something?

208
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,990
Pops! Are these all the condiments you've got?

209
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,370
Yeah. Our product lineup is the best!

210
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,210
This isn't it.

211
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,090
This isn't it, either.

212
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,880
Pops! Don't you have other stuff?!

213
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,590
Other stuff, huh?

214
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,440
Since Water Seven is a city of trade,

215
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,060
our store has all sorts of condiments
from around the world, so...

216
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,020
Dammit... Is it a condiment
that gramps mixed himself?

217
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,440
No, it's more fundamental...
Ugh! Dammit! I can't figure it out!

218
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,610
Oh? Sanji-kun!

219
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,160
That's strange. He didn't notice us.

220
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,420
Wrong person?

221
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,330
Must be--Chimney and Gonbe
weren't with that guy, either.

222
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,420
Hm? I've come this far?

223
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,130
This area took quite a bit
of damage from Aqua Laguna.

224
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,090
That's Galley-La's restoration team.

225
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,970
Oh? You're one of the Straw Hats!

226
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,750
Thanks for the food yesterday!

227
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,650
Hey, guys! Have a little break! Let's have lunch!

228
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,770
Okay!

229
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,900
Whoa! That's what I've been waiting for!

230
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,950
Yummy!

231
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,200
Hey, would you like one, too?

232
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,980
You dummy. It's rude to offer a plain
salted rice ball to the Straw Hats' cook.

233
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,330
I guess you're right!

234
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,080
No, I'll have one, too.
Thinking made me hungry.

235
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,050
Oh, then don't stop at one.
Eat as many as you want!

236
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,270
Thanks.

237
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,380
At any rate, you guys astounded us.

238
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,100
You outwitted Navy Headquarters.
That's incredible!

239
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,690
Hey, cook guy! What's wrong?! Are you okay?!

240
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,080
That darn Gramps Bang-Bang!

241
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,570
I hope he wasn't so drunk that he
put weird stuff in the rice balls!

242
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,630
What?! Gramps Bang-Bang?!

243
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,700
Did that old man make these rice balls?!

244
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,660
They're compliments of that gramps!
If you have complaints, talk to him!

245
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,750
I get it now! I finally get what
the secret of his flavor is!

246
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,900
I appreciate this a damn lot. So, this is it!

247
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,960
Thanks!

248
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Y-Yeah.

249
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,210
There.

250
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,260
Shhh.

251
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,640
Gramps!

252
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,480
I got it, gramps.

253
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,230
Oh, it's you.

254
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,840
Welcome back, cook guy!

255
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,070
Gramps, the decisive factor of your
flavor isn't some special ingredient.

256
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,740
Well, it's actually one of the
most basic ingredients... salt.

257
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,590
I heard you're the one who gave those
salted rice balls to the Galley-La guys.

258
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,830
You didn't?

259
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,010
Hm? Well, it's true. But that's
not the right answer yet.

260
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,750
The thing is that this salt is
unlike any I've ever used before.

261
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,220
It isn't simply salty like regular salt is.
It has a deep flavor.

262
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,440
How are you able to get such
a special salt on this island?

263
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,890
The answer is...

264
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,890
...Aqua Laguna.

265
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,080
Aqua Laguna is a detestable
and hated existence.

266
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,960
But it brings special seawater
that contains plentiful sea minerals.

267
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,120
The salt made from that
seawater is a special salt

268
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,370
that contains plentiful sea minerals.

269
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,490
That's the answer!

270
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,290
Correct! I've lost!

271
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,170
But, gramps, in order to make salt,
you need a large amount of seawater.

272
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,890
It's nearly impossible to
collect seawater in that storm.

273
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,470
There's gotta be a special way to do it.

274
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,650
Gramps, I'm responsible
for cooking for the gang.

275
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,770
I want to serve the best food
to the crew at all times.

276
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,830
I know it's a special salt.

277
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,320
But please give me some of your salt!

278
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,220
Say, lad...

279
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,780
Today is another fine day, isn't it...?

280
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,700
Huh? Y-Yeah.

281
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,160
We've been having sunny days
since the Aqua Laguna ebbed.

282
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,370
There's a place I wanna go.
Would you take me there?

283
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,330
A place you wanna go?

284
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,600
Lad, go up to one of the rooftops around here.

285
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,760
Rooftop?

286
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,020
Gramps, is this place okay?

287
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,720
Yeah.

288
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,140
Oh, it's ready!

289
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,640
Ready? You mean salt?

290
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,550
I see only roofs around here.

291
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,100
Take a closer look.

292
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,880
This area...

293
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,740
...gets submerged all the way up
to the rooftops during Aqua Laguna.

294
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,170
And after Aqua Laguna ebbs,

295
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,080
the seawater on the roof
gets completely evaporated.

296
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,540
And then, what's left is this.

297
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,470
I see! The salt of Aqua Laguna!

298
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,910
Hold on a sec... Does that mean...

299
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,460
...that all the roofs around here are like that?!

300
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,010
That's right. All the roofs around here
have finished making salt by now.

301
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,470
Take as much as you want.

302
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,440
This is more than enough!

303
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Lad, the salt of Aqua Laguna is
different from the salt from any sea.

304
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,940
There are still unknown seas in the world.

305
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,900
The All Blue...

306
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,180
Whoa, that's quite a bit of salt you collected.

307
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,610
Is that all salt?!

308
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,290
Our journey has still a long way to go, so...

309
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,250
By the way, gramps, when we got here,
two guys came out complaining.

310
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,050
Seriously, that food was awful.

311
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,380
Oh, those guys... It's about time...

312
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,090
Hey, gramps!

313
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,930
Let us have the same food we had earlier.

314
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,770
Well, I thought the food tasted awful at first,

315
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,480
but now I've got a craving to eat it again.

316
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,890
Gramps, what's going on?

317
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,940
I served them herbal medicine food.

318
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,500
Sailors can't eat good food on the ship,
so their taste buds don't work well,

319
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,570
but once the herbs' effect kicks in,
food starts tasting good.

320
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,300
I somehow feel spry, too.

321
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,700
Gramps, please, we're starving here!

322
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,250
Gramps, why do you stay in
Water Seven when you're so skilled?

323
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,840
Because I can't get away
from that salt anymore.

324
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,500
I see... but gramps,
when I come here next time,

325
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,800
I'll tell you the stories about
my experience in the All Blue.

326
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,430
Oh, yeah? I'll be looking forward to it.

327
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,770
Gramps!

328
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,400
Is your stall open, gramps?

329
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,510
Whoa! You ladies can eat free!

330
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,230
You're so wonderful!

331
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,550
Ladies in Water Seven really are the best!

332
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,450
Isn't that the real reason, you dirty old man?!

333
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,250
Cook guy, thanks for today. I had fun!

334
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,970
It's me who should be saying thanks.
Thanks to you guys...

335
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,340
--Huh?
--No, nothing.

336
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,820
Well then, we're gonna
go back to Grandma now!

337
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,600
Yeah! Be careful!

338
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,600
Hm?

339
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,400
Usopp?

340
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,860
"What, Luffy? Now you're
saying that you want me back?

341
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,820
Seriously, what will I do with you guys?

342
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,150
You can't do anything without me.

343
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,170
Well, all right, if you're so insistent,
I suppose I could come back."

344
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,120
Yeah, it's best if I can make it
so that they'll ask me to rejoin.

345
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,790
So this is pattern 23.

346
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,720
"Oh, hey, Chopper. It's a fine day today.
Let's go fishing or something."

347
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,880
"Hey, Luffy! Wanna come along?"

348
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,340
This one's good, too. Operation
Act Like Nothing Happened... Or...

349
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,230
"I've decided to head to Elbaf!"

350
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,780
"What?! Please don't go!"

351
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,730
"I was just kidding. I know how you guys feel."

352
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,210
"So you're coming back, Usopp?!"

353
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,230
"Of course I am, silly!

354
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,240
Geez, you guys must like me so much!"

355
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,520
What the hell is that idiot doing?

356
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,110
Food's ready!

357
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,830
Whoa!

358
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,850
Yummy! Today's food is especially yummy!

359
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,880
What's this?!

360
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,360
This is delicious!

361
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,460
Yeah, it is!

362
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,850
It really is yummy! Hey, Sanji!

363
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,260
Hm?

364
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,110
Thanks for always making yummy food!

365
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,010
Thanks!

366
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,210
There's more if you want it!

367
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,800
Hey, eyebrows! Give me more!

368
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,750
You can get it yourself!

369
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,690
--Give me more!
--Give me more!

370
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,350
Give me more, too!

371
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,560
I'll have some more, too.

372
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,660
My pleasure!

373
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,620
Lad! I'll be waiting to hear
the stories of your journey!

374
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,620
Whoa!

375
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,510
S-Straw Hat!

376
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,320
Th-There's trouble! The wanted
posters have been released!

377
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,600
Whoa! They're finally out?!

378
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,870
Straw Hat, the bounty on
your head has gotten crazy!

379
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,140
And the others have bounties, too!

380
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,560
Anyway, take a look at these!

381
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

382
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,960
"Everyone Finally Has A Bounty!
A Pirate Group Worth Over 600 Million!"

383
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
