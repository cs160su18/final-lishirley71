2
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,660
Don't tell me...

18
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,980
It's not that people fear God.

19
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,410
Fear itself is God.

20
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,070
Zoro!!

21
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,790
30 million volt...

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,920
The drum became...

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,790
...Hino!!

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,170
Why do you get up?

25
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,020
For the sake of our ancestors!

26
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,450
I-I'll come... with you!

27
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,640
No...?

28
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,740
Hey! Zoro! What're you doing?!

29
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,530
Wyper!

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,930
Skypiea will disappear...

31
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,230
It will be dropped to the ground...

32
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,910
Our village, too?!

33
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,980
Everything...

34
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,160
This is the Ark Maxim!

35
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,960
I know where they are.

36
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,920
It must be Nami and Eneru...!

37
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,170
Take me there!!

38
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,960
"They Finally Clash!
Pirate Luffy vs. God Eneru!!"

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
I can see Angel Island...!

40
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,280
Everyone, heso!

41
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,700
The unforgivably profane
Pagaya and his daughter,

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,070
along with their accomplice Gan Fall,
the former God, are on the run!

43
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,580
Please be careful!

44
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:09,590
If you see criminals,
please alert me immediately!

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,570
In the name of God Eneru, we,
the White Berets, protect Skypiea's peace!

46
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,310
Heso!

47
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,700
Oh, this is really reassuring.

48
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,050
But I'm scared. If those
criminals are hiding close to us,

49
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,990
won't we also get struck by God's judgment?

50
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,010
Report! Report!

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,460
What's the matter?

52
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes, sir! Actually...

53
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,210
What?! You say that Pagaya's
daughter has appeared at the harbor?!

54
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,820
The blasphemer has entered Gate 1!

55
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,870
Why? Why is she acting like
she wants to be captured?

56
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,700
Don't let her get away!
Capture her at any cost!

57
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,200
Come, criminal!

58
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,730
Please get out of my way!!

59
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,180
What're you doing?! Out of my way!

60
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,760
Why...?!

61
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,260
Captain!

62
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,690
Captain!

63
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
N-No...

64
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,330
It's the criminal!

65
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,780
It's the woman who went against God!

66
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,760
Don't come this way!

67
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,090
God'll cast judgment!

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,550
What an enormous amount of gold...

69
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,190
That girl from Angel Island... Apparently,
she's causing a scene on Angel Beach.

70
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,400
Conis?! It can't be...!
She should be on our ship!

71
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,300
There's a lot of commotion
going on outside, too.

72
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,170
Well... those are trifling matters, though...

73
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,440
Th-That Mantra ability you have...

74
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,010
You can even identify the person?!

75
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,720
I wouldn't say it's perfect.
But my case is special.

76
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,220
In addition to my strong Mantra ability,

77
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,790
I hear conversations by using my
lightning power to read radio waves.

78
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,240
If I hear a foolish conversation
somewhere, I cast my judgment.

79
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,840
As long as it's happening within
this nation, it's a simple matter.

80
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,330
That's why...

81
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,220
That certainly is an
ability suitable for God.

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,750
Try as hard as you like to run
and escape, people of the sky.

83
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,140
This is the end of Skypiea!

84
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,310
A party with angels dancing in the sky!

85
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,490
Hey you, have you ever seen
the look on people's faces

86
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,270
when they lose their foothold?

87
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,650
What's with this guy?!

88
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,910
What's with this guy?! What's with
this guy?! What's with this guy?!

89
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,160
What am I gonna do?! If I don't escape now...

90
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,980
No... Even if I could escape okay,
if this sky island will be gone...

91
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,860
Isn't there anything I can do?!

92
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,760
U-Um...

93
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,980
Is something wrong, sir?!

94
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,340
Who is that?

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,880
No... it's nothing.

96
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,630
Please... Please listen
to what I have to say!

97
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,400
Don't come! Don't get near us!!

98
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,820
Everyone, please listen!
There's no time to lose!

99
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,070
Please! Calm down and hear me out!

100
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,810
Shut up! Don't come!

101
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,130
Leave the island, you plague!

102
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,010
That's right! If you're here, we'll
also be struck by God's judgment!

103
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,140
You blasphemer!

104
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,660
No... I... came to...

105
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,270
Don't come near me!

106
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,890
This is a flame bazooka.

107
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,500
I'll shoot!

108
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,720
Everyone! Please go to the edge of
the clouds right away! To Cloud End!

109
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,100
Please escape to the Blue Sea!

110
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,750
This nation is about to disappear!

111
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,260
There is no time to waste!

112
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,110
Use every boat there is
and escape Angel Island!

113
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,400
What is this crazy talk...?!

114
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,870
God Eneru intends to eliminate this nation!

115
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,500
If you stay here, you'll all die!

116
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,050
Ha! Don't be ridiculous!
What're you trying to pull?!

117
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,790
Is this revenge?!
You're taking this nonsense too far!

118
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,200
Do you want us to be struck, too?!

119
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,630
Don't insult God Eneru!

120
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,890
Oh... I'm sorry...

121
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,040
What? She dropped her weapon?!

122
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,090
Hey! Capture her!

123
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:08,510
Yes, sir!

124
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,960
I... I do not accept Eneru as God!!

125
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,230
Father...

126
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,010
How terrible!

127
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,800
Get out of here, now!!

128
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,140
Evacuate! Evacuate!

129
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,580
Get away from that woman!

130
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,700
God's gonna cast judgment!

131
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,760
Oh?

132
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,000
This is strange. She hasn't
had judgment cast upon her.

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,020
Why...?

134
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,080
When she insulted God...

135
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,230
What's going on...?

136
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,040
It's because there's no longer any
point in eliminating just my life.

137
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,070
"Skypiea will be eliminated."

138
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,410
A member of the Divine Squad
escaped Upper Yard,

139
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,220
and this is the message that he
risked his life to let you all know.

140
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,810
He... He received God's judgment
together with my father.

141
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,200
What did she say about God? What?!

142
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,110
Doesn't God help us?

143
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,660
What's she saying?

144
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,130
There's no time to lose.

145
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,860
Everyone, please go to the edge of
the clouds immediately! To Cloud End!

146
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,620
Can't be...

147
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,050
H-Hold on a second

148
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,570
Hm?

149
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,990
Don't be ridiculous!
We can't just up and go like that!

150
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,610
We were born and raised in
this sky! After all these years...

151
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,960
That's right! We've never
even been to the Blue Sea!

152
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,410
There's no way we can live there! Besides...

153
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,680
Then are you going to wait to be killed?!

154
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,030
You all have known for the past
six years what kind of man Eneru is.

155
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,100
Once he says he will do something,
he will definitely carry it out! If you still...

156
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,450
It may not happen! Maybe there'll
be a miracle or something,

157
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,890
and the sky island may not have to disappear.

158
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,280
Y-Yeah. God may change
his mind or something.

159
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,180
Yeah... if that happens...

160
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,810
What we know better than anything is
that he has power to cause us despair!

161
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,640
And that the time is imminent!

162
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,830
What's the point of waiting
for a miracle to happen?!

163
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,370
At least God doesn't exist
in this nation right now!

164
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,810
Before you pray... before you
turn a blind eye to reality...

165
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,940
...you have to do what you can!

166
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,060
The time where you could survive
if you lie low as a victim is over!

167
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,370
You have to take action!

168
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,440
You can't protect your own life
by blaming someone later!

169
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,050
Come on now! Make the
decision to leave this land!

170
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,710
Escape to the Blue Sea!!

171
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,770
Hurry up and gather your things!!

172
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,530
To Cloud End!

173
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,530
To the edge of the clouds!

174
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,660
Do what that girl says!

175
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,530
Hurry up!

176
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,770
There's no time to waste!

177
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,560
Excuse me!

178
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,440
Do you know what happened
to the Divine Squad?!

179
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,170
My husband is in the Squad.
I'd like to escape with him!

180
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,480
My son is in it, too! Are the
Divine Squad members okay?!

181
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,060
My son, too! My only son left for duty

182
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,620
and hasn't come back yet!

183
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,620
Um... well...

184
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,160
The Divine Squad is probably already...

185
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,640
I don't know...

186
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,350
What on earth has the Divine Squad
been forced to do up until now?!

187
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,210
Where are they?!

188
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,030
Isn't there something you could tell us?

189
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,500
We, the White Berets, will look into
the matter of the Divine Squad!

190
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,260
We'll have them catch up with you all later!

191
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,300
Please go on ahead! It'll be crowded!

192
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,500
Captain McKinley...

193
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,070
Please hurry up now!

194
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,470
Captain!

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,940
I can guess what will
happen to the Divine Squad.

196
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,960
Eneru is that kind of man... I know that.

197
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,200
However, having people on this island
quickly evacuate is our priority right now.

198
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,640
I won't let what happened
in Birka happen here.

199
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,410
Birka...?

200
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,540
A sky island in the far southeast

201
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,890
where Eneru was born and raised.

202
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,590
I heard that it disappeared
without a trace six years ago.

203
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,380
Six... don't tell me...

204
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,350
That's right. Eneru destroyed his
homeland and came to this nation.

205
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,990
I heard that there were strong
warriors in Birka as well,

206
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,290
but they were nothing before Eneru.

207
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,020
He's invincible, hence he's "God."

208
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,870
It may be true.

209
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,280
I think you know this,

210
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,360
but we also used to be members of the
Divine Squad that served Gan Fall-sama.

211
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,900
We believed that even if it appeared
that we betrayed the Divine Squad,

212
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,310
by obeying God Eneru and staying on this
island, there was a way to protect people.

213
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,110
However, that approach was pitiful after all!

214
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,570
We tried as much as possible to make
sure that no one would anger God,

215
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,000
or at least that no one would go against him.

216
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,360
That's all we did!

217
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,060
How shameful! How shameful! How shameful!

218
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,160
How shameful!!

219
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,380
I don't think so.

220
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,930
I'm glad to hear you say that.

221
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,420
I don't think you have to feel so bad.

222
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,010
You did it because you were
thinking of everyone's welfare,

223
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,500
so I'd rather want to say thank you.

224
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,700
Captain...

225
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,010
Um... can I ask you to
take care of the people here?

226
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,830
Of course, but where're you going?

227
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,920
Actually, there're people who
don't know the escape route.

228
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,390
Since they're my friends, I have to go back.

229
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,140
Thank you!

230
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,200
Oh, the Blue Sea people...

231
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,390
Heso!

232
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,000
Heso!

233
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,330
It doesn't look like I can
carry them all at once...

234
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,250
At least, we need to...
somehow escape to the upper area.

235
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,820
Aisa!

236
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,750
You're sure that it's this way, right?!

237
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,650
Yeah! We're very close! I'm sure of it!

238
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,660
Okay!

239
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,490
That's it! Luffy! The hole on the
left-hand side! That's the place!

240
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,270
That's the place?! Alright!!

241
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,840
As I thought, it's apparently not
one of the five that survived...

242
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,820
Honestly... where on earth were they hiding?

243
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,970
Could it be...?

244
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:22,160
How aggravating... So my
prophecy did not come true.

245
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,850
"God"

246
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,050
Are you that Eneru guy?!

247
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,960
Luffy!!

248
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,260
What're you doing... to my friends?!

249
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,130
Which of that trash are you talking about?

250
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,830
Stay right there! I'm gonna
beat the crap outta you!

251
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,550
Watch your mouth! I am God!

252
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,850
What makes you God?!

253
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,880
He's picking a fight with Eneru big time.

254
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,160
Are you gonna be okay, Luffy?

255
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,460
H-Hey, Luffy! Be caref...

256
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,770
I can hear it now, the angels' party...

257
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,370
It seems that the residents
found out about Skypiea's fate.

258
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,380
I wonder how far they can get
before their foothold is lost.

259
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,560
Like I said... what makes you God?!

260
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,160
You'll know soon enough.

261
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,670
I see... Looks like you're not
an ordinary human, either.

262
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,230
However, you're only a Paramythia.

263
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,070
You haven't got a chance!

264
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,830
Before me, all is futile!

265
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,160
Hence I am God.

266
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,890
El... Thor!!

267
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,110
Luffy!!

268
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,170
Luffy...

269
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,550
Oh, no...

270
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,960
It seems that you dodged
it well... 60 Million Volt...

271
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,410
What?! Dodged it?!

272
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,960
...Jamboule!

273
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,680
100 Million Volt... Vaari!

274
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,610
That's right. It makes sense
when you think about it!

275
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,580
Lightning doesn't work on
Luffy because he's rubber!

276
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,200
Enough... already!!

277
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,660
Calm down! Physical attacks
won't work on my body!

278
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,900
Come to think of it, a monkey
from the Blue Sea like him is...

279
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,070
His lightning power is
completely ineffective!

280
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,230
To think that a human that isn't
affected by lightning exists...

281
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,600
It must've been something that
even Eneru couldn't imagine.

282
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:08,290
It could be... that Luffy is Eneru's one
and only natural enemy in the world!

283
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

284
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

285
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

286
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

287
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

288
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

289
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

290
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

291
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,090
Look! This is a ship befitting to God!

292
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,560
I will create a world however I please.

293
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,060
Destroy Skypiea and lead me
to the Endless Vearth!

294
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,010
I won't let you have your way!

295
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,420
Now activate, Deathpiea,
the circuit of despair!

296
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

297
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,130
"Maxim Surfaces! Deathpiea Is Activated!!"

298
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,490
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
