2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,340
She sacrificed herself in order to protect
us from an attack by the Government!

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,670
Then...

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,750
...after all, Robin was...

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,510
...lying?

6
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm not gonna let Robin die!

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,070
One-Sword Style! Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

8
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,880
Paulie-san!

9
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,970
We're not safe yet!

10
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,060
There's nothing to think about.

11
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,820
Let's sail out right away and follow them!

12
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,740
There's no other way.

13
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,700
We're off.

14
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,670
Hey, rope guy.

15
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,080
Please let us use a ship. No, rather than a ship,

16
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,130
isn't there any other sea train leaving?

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,960
Puffing Tom is the only sea train in this world.

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,900
It's a miraculous ship that is the result

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,560
of the combined efforts of a team
led by a legendary shipwright.

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,140
Then, let us borrow a ship.
The strongest and fastest one in this town!

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,030
Enough already, you idiots!

22
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,000
Didn't you see what just happened?!

23
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,370
You were almost pulled out to sea by that wave!

24
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,950
He's right! There's no way you
can set out to sea right now!

25
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,060
Are you stupid?!

26
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,150
Are you fools?!

27
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,590
Even with the usual Aqua Laguna,
no ship has made it through!

28
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,720
You saw the collapsing backstreets, didn't you?

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,840
The town that had never been
damaged by Aqua Laguna up until now...

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,600
...is now wrecked. How terrible...

31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,870
On top of that, the Aqua Laguna
this year is incomparably huge.

32
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,080
If you put out a ship now, even if you
challenge it with the biggest galleon,

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,570
it'll shatter the ship immediately.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,740
I can't let you sail out when I know you'll die.

35
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,410
Wait until morning.

36
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,340
Once the storm passes, there's no
problem letting you borrow a ship.

37
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,210
Hey, you guys go to the
evacuation site or someplace.

38
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,240
We're done searching for missing people.

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,460
It wouldn't be funny if you got taken out to
sea by the wave while just standing around.

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,340
Yes, sir!

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,090
If...

42
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,300
Hm?

43
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,260
If we are to wait until morning,
can our wish come true?

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,070
I know Enies Lobby.

45
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,940
When I heard it was a Government island,
I remembered something.

46
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,900
Isn't that the place...

47
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,400
Isn't that the place where
the Gates of Justice are?

48
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,240
It's all right! Now let's move forward

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,660
with the sun always in our hearts

50
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,040
As power passes through our clasped hands

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

52
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:13,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

53
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,940
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

54
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

55
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:35,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,640
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,380
but what you cherish most will be right there

58
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,390
And if you get into a jam

59
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,390
I'll always be there to protect you

60
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,640
It's all right! Now let's move forward

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,150
with the sun always in our hearts

62
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,420
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

63
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,650
and gaze at the light beyond

64
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

65
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

66
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

68
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,010
One Piece

69
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:38,980
"Another Sea Train? Rocketman Charges Forth!"

70
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,730
Isn't that the place where
the Gates of Justice are?

71
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,400
What's that?

72
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,220
Enies Lobby is the
Government-owned judicial island.

73
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,520
What's there is a court in name only.

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,670
Being taken to Enies Lobby itself
is considered to be proof of guilt.

75
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,950
After passing through this
empty court without stopping,

76
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,120
criminals soon reach huge, cold steel doors.

77
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,550
These doors are called the Gates of Justice.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,140
Once criminals go through them,

79
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,980
they won't see the sunlight ever again--
they're doors of despair.

80
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,940
This is because there are only
two places that you can reach

81
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,400
after sailing out from the
harbor beyond these gates.

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,120
"Navy"

83
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,930
One is the greatest military force for
justice in the world-- Navy headquarters.

84
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,830
The other is Impel Down,
the large, deep-sea prison,

85
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,040
where torture rooms and gallows stand
side by side, that holds vicious prisoners

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,420
who once ran amok all over the world.

87
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,880
In other words,

88
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,080
Enies Lobby is a judicial institution
that criminals are just dumped into

89
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,640
without being shown any mercy.

90
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,930
Isn't that right?!

91
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,060
Robin's got a bounty on her head.

92
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,770
No matter where she's taken,
she'll see hell beyond that point!

93
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,650
Each moment we sit here talking,
she gets closer to the Gates of Justice!

94
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,660
There's no way we can wait until morning!

95
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,000
If you know that much,
I've got only one thing to say.

96
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,640
Even if the sea were calm
and you were able to sail out,

97
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,060
you shouldn't go there.

98
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,930
Don't forget that you guys
yourselves are pirates.

99
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,050
As you said, Enies Lobby is the front door
that leads to the World Government's hub.

100
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,310
Naturally, battle lines are
drawn up taking that into account.

101
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,540
No pirate would think to get back
crew members taken to that island...

102
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,360
...because it's crystal clear what would happen.

103
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,790
Are you trying to pick a fight with
the hub of the World Government?!

104
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,310
H-He's right! You should give up!

105
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,640
You can't sail out until morning
because of Aqua Laguna!

106
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,370
Even if you go after them, you'll get killed!

107
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,260
There's no chance of you guys surviving!

108
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,220
Luffy...

109
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,720
Then, we'll...

110
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,730
...steal a ship and go!

111
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,600
We're gonna sail out now!

112
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,230
Our friends are waiting!

113
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,440
Don't stand in our way!

114
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,150
E-Even the wave got angry, too!

115
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,790
--Wha...
--Does he wanna fight?

116
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,790
Boy, that scared me.

117
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,500
Fine. I'll take you on!

118
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,180
Hold it, you guys!

119
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,380
Kokoro-san!

120
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,170
It's you who's wrong here, Straw Hat.

121
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,080
Paulie is right, you idiot.

122
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
Shut up! It's none of--

123
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,950
None of my business... huh?

124
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,740
Well, listen. If we let you be,
you're gonna risk your lives, aren't you?

125
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,080
Look. If there exists a ship that
can get through that Aqua Laguna,

126
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,750
it could only be a sea train
built by a legendary man.

127
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,780
But it's not here right now!
That's why we're trying to go in a ship!

128
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,430
If you're prepared to die, then come with me.

129
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,230
I'll give you a ride... on a sea train!

130
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,090
--Who's that?
--Beats me.

131
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,680
You fools! What're you doing?!

132
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,970
Besides the criminals,
everyone here is wearing a uniform!

133
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,890
G-Get him!

134
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,850
So it turns out this way anyway, huh?

135
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,100
I thought I had a good plan...

136
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,120
"Operation Play Innocent"...

137
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,250
Hm?

138
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,330
What?! S-Sanji!

139
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,420
Hold it!

140
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,380
We're not gonna let you pass through here.

141
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,670
Twins, huh?

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,470
Collier...

143
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,310
...Frit!

144
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,700
Sanji! Why are you on the sea train?!

145
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,660
I wanna ask you the same question.

146
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,420
How about it, you... Well, I don't know
what your name is, but you over there...

147
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,620
Oh, what a load of crap, you jerk!

148
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,380
Hm?

149
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,050
Hm? Whoa!

150
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,120
There you go, transponder snails!

151
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Phew, all right! Geez,
there are several of them here.

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,770
I wonder if this is also a communications room.

153
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,850
Those government officials from the car earlier
had only stupid stuff, like masks and costumes!

154
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,440
I can finally contact Nami-san using them.

155
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,900
So you two are... pirate friends, huh?

156
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,400
Former friends.

157
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,860
Who the hell are you?

158
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,790
I'm Franky, demolition worker and the
face of the Water Seven underworld.

159
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,940
So you're Franky?! You damn bastard!

160
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,790
How dare you give our long-nose
a terrible time, then?!

161
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,440
How many pieces do you want
me to cut you into, you jerk?!

162
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,340
Ah, wait, wait, wait...

163
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,470
Ah, Sanji, hold on a sec. All sorts
of things happened after that.

164
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,720
You son of a bitch!
Just you wait till I get untied!

165
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,350
Stop saying things like that!

166
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,420
Well, he saved the Merry once.

167
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,190
Oh, that's right... The Merry is...

168
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,590
Hey, hey, wait a sec!
This is no time to start moping!

169
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,410
Anyway, mister, please untie me!

170
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,370
Who'd untie you?! You should stay
captured for the rest of your life!

171
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,450
You bastard! How dare you talk
like that when I asked you nicely?!

172
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,050
Stop it...! You guys!

173
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,090
If we don't hurry up, they'll find us, right?!

174
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,700
You're getting on my nerves!

175
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,830
--What'd you say?!
--Shut up, both of you!

176
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,670
Just untie me already!

177
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,830
Don't order me around!

178
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,640
Arrrrgh! Stop it already!

179
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,730
Ah... Captain T-Bone...

180
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,550
Franky is with them, too, you said?

181
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,720
Yes... but the sea train has already departed.

182
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,480
All the craftsmen are also looking for
Straw Hat and the other one, but...

183
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,650
There's no limit to their strength
when they know it's okay to save her!

184
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,830
Whoa...

185
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,960
Underground!

186
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,960
This warehouse has been abandoned
for more than eight years.

187
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,540
When it comes to the sea train, it's been
untouched for more than twelve years.

188
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,860
--Let's go, Chopper!
--Yeah!

189
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,210
It may no longer run, though!

190
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,050
Hey! That would be a problem!

191
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,680
Hey, hey, wait for me.

192
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,400
Even if you go in a rush, you can't
get inside without the keys.

193
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,020
Hm...? What the heck?

194
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,030
It's open, huh?

195
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,490
Whoooa! There it is!

196
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,610
This looks cool!

197
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,820
Amazing!

198
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,920
I'm warning you, this is a crazy train.

199
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,540
Its name is Rocketman.

200
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,090
We can't even allow passengers to be on board.

201
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,520
Rocketman!

202
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,230
It sounds fast!

203
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,090
Cool!

204
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,490
What's up with that face?

205
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,910
That shark head is attached as a joke.

206
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,380
Hm?

207
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,980
Ice pops!

208
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,150
Straw Hat... So you really were okay.

209
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,310
It's just like what the pirate girl said.

210
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,780
So you brought them here, Kokoro-san?

211
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,040
Looks like you survived, huh, Iceberg?

212
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,580
What're you doing here?

213
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,380
The fact that we both are here means
that we were thinking the same thing.

214
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,960
Hm?

215
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,580
We just can't help giving idiots a hand, can we?

216
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,200
Use it. I've finished servicing it.

217
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,230
Water and coal have been loaded
and it's storing the steam right now.

218
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,850
So you were getting it ready for us, pops?!

219
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,140
Oops.

220
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,630
Wait to rejoice until you survive the ride.

221
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,310
After all, this was a failure built
before Puffing Tom was completed.

222
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,860
No matter how much you tune it up,
its steam engine can't control the speed.

223
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,530
I can't guarantee your lives.

224
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,700
Okay! Thanks, Ice pops!

225
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,830
All right! Let's go!

226
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,260
Guys! Get on board!

227
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,760
Granny! We're leaving as soon as Nami comes!

228
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,380
Ooops!

229
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,690
Luffy! Are you okay?

230
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,300
You've been shaky on your feet for a while.

231
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,220
He probably bled too much.

232
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,400
I kinda feel weak. If only we
had some meat or something...

233
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,390
Hurry! This way!

234
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,860
Wait!

235
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,280
You don't have to go to a place like
that, right? Why don't you eat here?

236
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,710
That's right! You're starving, right?

237
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,270
There's no way I could eat that much!

238
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,120
What?!

239
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,160
Sorry it took so long!

240
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,320
--Nami...
--Hey! What're you doing?!

241
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,960
Hurry up and get on board, you idiot!

242
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,320
Wow, amazing!

243
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,010
So this is a sea train, too?

244
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,700
Whoa... I never knew there was
another one in a place like this.

245
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,260
I'm surprised!

246
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,940
Where have you been, Nami?!

247
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,460
Who was it that said we didn't have time?!

248
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,990
What's that stuff?!

249
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,310
--Meat and beverages.
--I'm sorry that I complained.

250
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,220
Here we go.

251
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,770
If you can get on the railway after going out

252
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,130
to the sea via a canal, that'll be
a success for the time being.

253
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,510
Don't worry. I'm more experienced
in operating it than you are.

254
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,770
You take it easy and rest here.

255
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,830
Sorry.

256
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,260
Chimney and Gonbe should be playing
around there. Please take care of them.

257
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,920
Yeah.

258
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,890
Well, I bet he's fine.

259
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,590
Hm?

260
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,790
We're talking about a guy who
survived being hit by a sea train...

261
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,390
On top of that, we have the
King of the Pirates and his friends.

262
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,690
Straw Hat!

263
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,820
They are...

264
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,240
The Franky Family!

265
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,110
At a busy time like this...!

266
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,160
Please... take us with you!

267
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,170
I heard from the Galley-La people
that you're going to Enies Lobby!

268
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,400
Our Bro, Franky, was taken
in by the Government!

269
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,010
We want to go after them... but we can't
get through Aqua Laguna by ourselves!

270
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,700
It's the World Government you're up against.

271
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,930
It doesn't matter who it is!

272
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,770
We're gonna get Bro back!

273
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,340
We'd give up our lives for him!

274
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,650
Please!

275
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,610
Help us out! Straw Hat!

276
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,070
Please! Bro is in danger!

277
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,620
Give me a break! Do you know
what you've been doing to us?!

278
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,920
We do!

279
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,300
We're swallowing our pride and begging you!

280
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,980
We want to save Bro!

281
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,190
--Get on.
--What?!

282
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,650
Hurry!

283
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,200
Straw Hat...

284
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,890
Hey, Luffy!

285
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,160
Oh, it'll be fine.

286
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,200
Thank you!

287
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,330
We're deeply indebted to you!

288
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,210
Hurry up!

289
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,520
Ah! But we don't have to get on the train.

290
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,300
Hm?

291
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,320
We'll jump out to the sea using our
King bulls at the same time you do.

292
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,510
So all you need to do is to let us
hold on to the end of the train.

293
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,930
King bulls?

294
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,770
Thanks for letting us go with you!
Well then, see you later!

295
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,730
Let's go!

296
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,940
Yeah!

297
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,630
All right! We can go rescue Bro!

298
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,660
--Yeah!
--Hurry up!

299
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,100
How is this?

300
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,300
Okay! Well then, let's go, shall we?!

301
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,590
Now... pirates! Don't go
getting thrown off, okay?!

302
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,360
Now departing Water Seven for Enies Lobby...

303
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,110
Here comes the sea train Rocketman!

304
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,820
All right! Depart!

305
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,860
We're gonna go...! To get everything back!

306
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,330
We had a dream that day

307
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,120
Our belief in ourselves

308
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:47,170
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

309
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:56,720
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

310
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:06,900
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

311
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:15,450
In the end, we can all surely smile

312
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,180
Go! Rocketman! Don't be
beaten by Aqua Laguna!

313
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,160
Hey, Luffy. Somehow,
there are weird guys in here.

314
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,020
Straw Hat! Thank you for helping us,
the fifty members of the Franky Family!

315
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,570
This is good. Everyone here
has the same enemy!

316
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,000
We'll work together and beat them up!

317
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,360
On the next episode of One Piece!

318
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,020
"Rescue Our Friends! A Bond
