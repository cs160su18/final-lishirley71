00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,880

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,320

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,690
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

78
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

79
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:44,320
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago
to go on to the next stage - the New World.

80
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,990
Rise to the top!

81
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,960
You guys!

82
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,960
I've got a lot of things that I want
to share with you but in any case,

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,300
thank you for going along with
my selfish decision for 2 years!

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,640
Set sail!!

85
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:18,360
"A Surprising Fact!
The Man Who Guarded the Sunny!"

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,530
Brother, it's hard to dig!

87
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,450
SABAODY ARCHIPELAGO

88
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,110
That's because this island is
made mostly out of tree roots.

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,240
Please forgive us, don't bury us!

90
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,790
I'll do anything, just don't kill me!

91
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,210
The captain, Black, forced us to do it!

92
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,460
Once we joined them, we thought...

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,590
...we could kill the Straw Hats...

94
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,390
...with high bounties...

95
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,940
...easily from within, as we like!

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,440
Drip!

97
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,030
Hey, stop! He's gonna die!
Are you a Devil Fruit eater?

98
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,530
Don't do it!

99
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,730
Yes! I got him...

100
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,330
Huh? What's going on here? Logia?!

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,880
But, look what happened!

102
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,010
I thought he just looked different
because I hadn't seen him for 2 years.

103
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,930
The pirate - Straw Hat...
No wonder! He was just a fake.

104
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,220
Do you think the gods
will forgive them, Coribou?

105
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,640
I dig! I dig!

106
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,940
That's right! Let's bury them!

107
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,110
Oh gods! Let us bury these fools!

108
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,110
Don't! Please don't kill us!

109
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:56,410
But I saw the real Straw
Hat Luffy for myself!

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,540
I told you that I had no choice!

111
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,500
THE PLACE WHERE "THE FAKE
STRAW HATS" ASSEMBLED

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,130
Dark King Rayleigh stood in our way!

113
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,930
He could even fight Uncle Kizaru equally
- what would you expect us to do?

114
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,970
The Caribou brothers and their crew
and some of the fake Straw Hats...

115
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,430
...got away successfully.

116
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,440
We caught all the others

117
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,360
but 2 Pacifistas were severely
damaged by the real Straw Hats.

118
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,610
One of them was the prototype that
cornered the Straw Hats 2 years ago.

119
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,870
Of course, his strength hasn't changed.
So they must have gotten stronger!

120
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,370
They've improved themselves
in last 2 years, big time!

121
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,090
Make sure to tell the
Navy HQ in the New World.

122
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,470
The Straw Hats are completely revived!

123
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,980
They're gone before you know it.

124
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,990
Monkey-chan and everybody,
they all got stronger.

125
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,160
--Were you watching?
--Yes, I'm a fan of theirs.

126
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,630
You're thinking about
something, aren't you, Ray-san?

127
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,590
Hmm? Well... Yeah...

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,430
Hey, that's a nice ship!

129
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,190
I stole it. My house burned
down so I'm living here.

130
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,440
Yeah? And what's your name?

131
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,820
Rayleigh.

132
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,490
I'm Roger! I think we were
destined to meet, Rayleigh!

133
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,200
Destined?

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,620
Do you wanna turn the
world upside down with me?

135
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,910
Huh? The world?

136
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,040
Who are you and where you from? Go away!

137
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,260
Your ship is small but it looks like it
can endure storms if you handle it right.

138
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,050
It's perfect for us to set sail in!

139
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,640
Us? Set sail? Don't decide for me.

140
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,560
Why should I join you?

141
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,810
Like I said, to turn the world upside
down! Alright, let's set sail, Rayleigh!

142
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,990
Maybe nothing in this
world happens by accident.

143
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,330
As everything happens for a reason,

144
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,410
our destiny slowly takes form.

145
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,960
At any rate, Luffy looks great in that hat,

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,000
better than ever.

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Maybe I want to live a little longer.

148
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,180
UNDER THE SEA NEAR SABAODY ARCHIPELAGO

149
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,180
The surface is far up there already.

150
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,770
What a view!
Submarines can't have windows this wide!

151
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,100
We're sinking and sinking!

152
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,610
I can't stop worrying about flooding!

153
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,360
Feels like we're leaving the
inhabited world. It makes me nervous!

154
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,120
C-C-Can we go back on the
surface again for sure?

155
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,450
I-It's not like I'm scared but...

156
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,210
It's beautiful down here!

157
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,630
Look at that!

158
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,640
Trees... No, roots!

159
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,730
Oh yeah! Come to think of it,
Sabaody Archipelago consists of giant mangroves!

160
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,070
I'm overwhelmed by the beauty of nature!
I'm so surprised - my eyes could pop out!

161
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,160
I don't have eyes though!

162
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,030
I've seen this already.

163
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,450
Yeah, because you got on the wrong ship!
Shut up! Everybody's having a great time!

164
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,920
I can't believe these roots are
running down to the sea bottom!

165
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,380
They're enormous and magnificent!

166
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,090
I can't hold it any longer!

167
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,810
Hey, Chopper...
There's something behind that tree!

168
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,430
What?

169
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,440
Wow, it's huge!

170
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,940
How exciting! An underwater
adventure! It's like a dream come true!

171
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,110
Oh, fish!

172
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,400
I think I can catch them!

173
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,530
The fish here look delicious too.

174
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,910
Stop it, you fools!

175
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,920
What if the bubble pops!
Don't ever do that again or I kill you!

176
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,540
Nami-san, give us some dos and
don'ts on the coated ship

177
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,460
before they do something stupid.

178
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,260
Okay, Sanji-kun! Rayleigh-san gave me a note.

179
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Alright, everyone, listen...

180
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,350
She's moving! A real, beautiful woman!

181
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,260
Sanji!

182
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,850
--It's gonna pop! It's gonna pop!
--How can you fly that far with nosebleed!

183
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,400
What?!

184
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Sanji flew out into the water!

185
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,780
It's amazing.

186
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:25,580
The bubble doesn't break even under
tremendous pressure in this deep water

187
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,370
but things can pass through it like that.

188
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,580
Sanji! Come back!

189
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,800
I feel weak in the water...

190
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Hang in there!

191
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,940
What happened to you, Sanji?!
You've become even more susceptible to women!

192
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,480
This isn't like you!

193
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,240
I feel sorry for him... What happened to this
ladies' man - Sanji-san in the past 2 years?

194
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,330
At this rate, he's gonna
bleed to death once he meets

195
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,790
the Mermaids
that he's longing to see.

196
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,580
I can't help worrying.

197
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,050
We'll have to call for blood
donations at the Fish-Man Island.

198
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,260
I wonder if Fish-Men and Mermaids
have the same blood as humans.

199
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,510
The bubble that coats the
Sunny has the same quality...

200
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,350
...as the bubbles at Sabaody
Archipelago as we just saw.

201
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,520
Stop analyzing the bubble
in such a calm manner!

202
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,230
Yes, Robin's right.
Basically, they're the same.

203
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,240
It stretches to a certain point and beyond
that, it allows things to get through.

204
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,290
Which means if we fire a gun or a
cannon at a creature that attacks us,

205
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,040
the bubble won't break.

206
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,670
Huh? Then, on what occasion
will it break instead?

207
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,690
As you can imagine, when there are too many

208
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,700
holes at once, it'll break. For example,

209
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,510
if we are bitten by a Sea
Kings' fangs, it'll be trouble.

210
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,930
It's coming from behind!

211
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,600
They're fighting... We're safe!

212
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,110
Or if the ship itself breaks up by
crashing into a rock or a trench,

213
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:26,110
the broken mast or planking will break
the bubble and that also spells danger.

214
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,780
So we have to be careful with
creatures and obstacles in the sea.

215
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,540
As long as we don't do anything
foolish from inside, it'll be fine.

216
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,170
I see! It's tougher than I thought!

217
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:42,250
But 70% of ships that head
for the Fish-Man Island...

218
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,090
...end up sinking. So be cautious.

219
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,130
What's gonna happen?!

220
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,180
With my Gatling, I can catch
a whole school of fish!

221
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,980
Then let's see which of
us can catch more fish!

222
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,590
Weren't you guys listening to what Nami said?!

223
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,780
"Too many holes" is no good!

224
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,110
Don't ever try it again or I'll kill you!

225
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,580
Damn! Hachi said he'd show us
the way to the Fish-Man Island

226
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,620
so I thought it was gonna be a safe trip!

227
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,830
Oh yeah!

228
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,960
They gave me a lot of lunches!

229
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Since Sanji is sick,
let's eat these, everybody!

230
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,420
I'm so starved!

231
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,340
My bones are starved!

232
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,680
Nami, the ship is gonna
be stable for a while?

233
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,140
Don't we have to do anything?

234
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,690
Nope. We just have to ride
this big sea current for now.

235
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,480
So, yeah, we can continue
on like this for a while.

236
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
We don't have much to do until later.

237
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,150
Then we have a little time, huh?

238
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,490
There's something that I
have to tell you all about.

239
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,810
There's something that I
have to tell you all about.

240
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,790
Could it be about...

241
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,290
...The robot's secrets?!

242
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,790
You have more secrets?!

243
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,090
What can you transform into?!
Or you have a secret weapon?!

244
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,090
Tell us, robot brother!

245
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,220
Super Armored Me!

246
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,600
No, I'm afraid...

247
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,650
I'm afraid it's not about that-robo.

248
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,190
Wow, cool! He speaks Robotese!

249
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,450
This is what I wanna tell you about.

250
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,320
Go ahead and eat while you're listening.

251
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,040
Hachi told us that he would show
us the way to the Fish-Man Island

252
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,710
but he got severely injured at Sabaody and

253
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,170
he's under medical care at Fish-Man Island.

254
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,840
He got injured for the same reason as Duval.

255
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,180
He had been protecting the Thousand Sunny.

256
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,930
Around a year ago, the Navy
found out about the Sunny

257
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,020
and those two both faced fierce battles
and were taken out of commission.

258
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,730
Huh? Then how did the ship
remain undamaged after that?

259
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,990
There was someone else who fought for it.

260
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,410
There was someone else?

261
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,580
He's the one who separated us 2 years ago.

262
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,330
The big Warlord - Bartholomew Kuma!

263
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:15,760
I couldn't believe my eyes when
I got to the Sunny a few days ago...

264
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,350
I've been expecting you.

265
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,020
What are you doing here?!

266
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,400
Mission accomplished.

267
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,460
There isn't even a scratch on the Sunny.

268
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,750
And Rayleigh told me later...

269
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,260
I work for the Revolutionaries army.

270
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,800
Since I have a connection with them,
I wanna let them get away from here.

271
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,680
I think you guys half expected that.

272
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,890
He saved our lives!

273
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,020
And after we vanished from the island,

274
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,650
Kuma-san visited Rayleigh and told him...

275
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,200
I don't have much time left.

276
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,660
I don't know what made him obey the Navy

277
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,570
but he agreed to be a guinea pig and let

278
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,240
his body be modified into a cyborg

279
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,440
piece by piece and he somehow

280
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,210
lost his personality before the War of the Best.

281
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,130
But I don't think he could guess what

282
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,040
each of us would do after we get separated!

283
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,020
Even so he waited for us at the
ship without his personality?

284
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,940
He made Dr. Vegapunk, who modified him,

285
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,530
agree to program a mission into his mind.

286
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,010
"Defend the pirate ship until the day that one of the

287
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,210
Straw Hats comes back to the ship."

288
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,410
That's why, for the past 2
years, without his own memory,

289
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,710
he had been carrying out his own

290
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,160
orders, as a human weapon, waiting for us.

291
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,240
That's insane.

292
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,920
Why did he do such a thing for us?

293
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,840
Terms like "connection,"
"Revolutionaries army,"

294
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,790
remind me about Luffy's father - the
leader of the Revolutionaries army.

295
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,180
I don't know my father that well.

296
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,730
But that bear-like guy was a good guy, huh?

297
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,020
Kuma...

298
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:43,250
There is no mistake that he's the one
who gave us the past 2 worthwhile years.

299
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,580
We can't even ask him why he
did it but just remember that.

300
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:57,920
Bartholomew Kuma turned out
to be one of our greatest allies.

301
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:04,330
But even if we meet him again,
Kuma is now a heartless human weapon.

302
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,490
That's all I have to say.

303
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,140
I appreciate what he did but
there are still some mysteries.

304
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,520
I hope we can find out his motive one day.

305
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,270
Ally?

306
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,940
--Oh, you woke up, Sanji.
--Eat lunch! It's from the Maiden Island!

307
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,280
Maiden Island? Is that
Kuma guy really an ally?

308
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,080
Don't you realize where
I was for the past 2 years?

309
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,960
What kind of training were you doing
at the dream island full of women, Luffy?

310
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,830
Whoa, whoa, Sanji-san, I don't
know what you've been through

311
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,920
but let's enjoy the voyage now!
Do you wanna sing with me?

312
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,720
Stop trying to cheer me up! I feel pathetic!

313
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,800
Brother, there he is. Straw Hat.

314
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,230
I can see that, you fool!

315
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,650
I'm gonna join them this time for sure!

316
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,060
How deeply are we submerged now?

317
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,360
It's getting darker and darker.

318
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,570
We went through the euphotic zone and

319
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,020
we're at the bottom of the twilight zone.

320
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,470
It must be more than 1000 meters below.

321
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,820
It's really quiet.

322
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,530
It feels different from submersibles.

323
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,670
It feels like flying in the sky.

324
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,080
The sky, huh?

325
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,260
I have to start using what
I studied on Weatheria for 2 years.

326
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,170
Whale! There is a whale!

327
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,260
--Laboon! Laboon!
--No, that's old man Whitebeard!

328
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,320
Hey, hey, there is no time
to relax and watch whales.

329
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,110
70% will sink! 70%! I can't just sit around!

330
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,800
I can't believe we have less than a 50%

331
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,930
chance to get to the Fish-Man Island.

332
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,790
I don't see any creatures or Sea Kings

333
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,460
or obstacles that look dangerous yet.

334
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,750
There's something at 6
o'clock! Is it a creature? No...

335
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,130
Are you guys all ready?!

336
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,970
--Yes, brother!
--Yes, yes!

337
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,800
The target is right there!

338
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,230
It's easier to just destroy their
ship and let it be swallowed by the sea

339
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,110
but that's no good because they
won't know who did it to them.

340
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,440
We gotta cut their heads
off and bring them back

341
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,610
to show the world what Caribou is capable of!

342
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,030
Yes!

343
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,580
They're not ready to fight!
It's a complete surprise attack!

344
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,410
Don't make a mistake, guys!

345
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,830
--Yes!
--Yes! Yes!

346
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,880
Hey, guys! There is a ship kind
of thing coming from behind!

347
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,470
--What?
--A ship?

348
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,050
It's coming towards us!

349
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,050
Charge!

350
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,110
--It's a pirate ship!
--They're pushing against us!

351
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,480
Go away! The bubble is gonna pop!

352
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,780
No! They're gonna come through the bubble!

353
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,950
Who are they?

354
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,880
Along with the attacking Caribou Pirates,
the Sunny sinks to greater depths.

355
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
They reach the giant

356
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,390
submarine waterfall Plume.

357
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,700
But there, the bane of the high seas,

358
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,060
the Kraken, is living.

359
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,840
"Deadly Combat under the Sea!
The Demon of the Ocean Strikes!"

361
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
