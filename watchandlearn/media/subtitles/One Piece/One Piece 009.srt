2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,220
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,180
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,540
Terrible news, everyone!

25
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,920
Pirates are attacking!

26
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,390
Pirates! Pirates!

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,350
Pirates are attacking!

28
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,030
Run for your lives!

29
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,560
Pirates! Run for your lives!

30
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,910
"Liar of Justice? Captain Usopp"

31
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,630
It'd be reckless to go straight
into the Grand Line now!

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,640
Yeah, some meat would
be nice to have first.

33
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,440
Eating nothing but fruit
everyday is no good...

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,940
Need some booze, too!

35
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,370
What're you talking about?!

36
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,860
That's not what I mean!

37
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,620
The Grand Line is the most
dangerous place in the world!

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,930
On top of that, it's crawling with
strong pirates after the One Piece!

39
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,020
And they're all on
powerful ships, of course!

40
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,790
We need more people, too.

41
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,410
The number of crew members,
the lack of equipment on this ship...

42
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,690
There's no way we
could survive like this!

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,460
Yeah, we need a cook. And a musician.

44
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,810
A musician?!

45
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,290
You're so stupid...

46
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,800
A little to the south of here is
an island with people living on it.

47
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,930
It'd be best if we can get
ahold of a real ship there...

48
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,100
Alright! Time to eat some meat!

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,540
Don't forget the booze!

50
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,540
You guys!

51
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,670
Pirates are here!

52
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,100
Pirates!

53
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,310
Everyone run away!

54
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,670
Pirates are here!

55
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,750
Pirates!

56
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,050
Terrible news!

57
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,710
Pi... rates...

58
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,960
The pirates...

59
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,270
...are just a lie!

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,490
Oww...

61
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,820
You exaggeration-spewing kid!
I'm gonna get you today for sure!

62
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,670
Stay right where you are!

63
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,660
I'll show you a thing or two!

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,620
Here they come!
Here they come! Here they come!

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,460
Here they come!

66
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,320
Get back here, you damn kid!

67
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,550
Just try and catch me!

68
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,850
Come and get me!

69
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,560
Dammit! He got away again!

70
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,840
He's one hell of a troublemaker!

71
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,760
He's in trouble if I find him!

72
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,280
Where the hell'd he go?!

73
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,550
Another job well done today!

74
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,360
I sent the wind of excitement
into this boring village!

75
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
There he is!

76
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,080
Oh, it's you guys!

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,920
Good morning, Captain Usopp!

78
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,300
The Usopp Pirates have arrived!

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,850
Pepper! Carrot!

80
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,260
Is it just you two? Where's Onion?

81
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,560
Terrible news! Terrible news!

82
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,360
Oww!

83
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,910
Terrible news!

84
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,600
Onion...

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,740
What's he freaking out about?

86
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Terrible news! Terrible news!

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,070
Terrible news! Pirates are here!

88
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,430
There's a boat with a skull
mark at the north shore!

89
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,620
Yeah, right!

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,380
It's the truth!

91
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,620
T-The truth?

92
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,130
It's true! This is bad!

93
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,180
Oops! It's time for my snack!

94
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,180
Don't run away!

95
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,360
Actually, I have "I'll Die if
I Don't Eat My Snacks-iosis"!

96
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
Liar!

97
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,640
Don't you want to be
a real pirate, Captain?!

98
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,320
What good is a pirate
who's afraid of pirates?!

99
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,040
If I recall correctly,
it was Buggy the Clown's mark!

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,460
B-B-Buggy the Clown?!

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,880
I think I'll just...

102
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,620
But it was two small boats!

103
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,100
And three people or so...

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,630
Alright! Let's go, Usopp Pirates!

105
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,670
To protect this village's peace!

106
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,350
Alright, let's go! Follow me!

107
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,070
R-Right!

108
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,520
Finally on dry land again...

109
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,650
There's a village past here?!

110
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,860
Yeah. It looks like it's
a small one, though...

111
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,290
Oh! In that case, meat, meat!
Meat, meat, meat!

112
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,160
There's a place to eat
in this village, right?!

113
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,080
Forget about meat
for a minute, will you?!

114
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,480
Huh?!

115
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,770
Careful!

116
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,730
I sense people!

117
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,970
Where?! Where?! Where?!

118
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,530
Look out!

119
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,660
So cool!

120
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,900
Is this the time to be impressed?!

121
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,760
I am Usopp, leader of the great
pirates who reign over this village!

122
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,130
People praise me--
and then praise me more--

123
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,720
as "Captain Usopp"!

124
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
Huh?

125
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,430
If you're thinking of attacking
this village, then forget it!

126
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,020
My 80 million subordinates
won't sit by quietly!

127
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,100
Awesome!

128
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,020
You're lying, aren't you?

129
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,080
Yikes! She saw through it!

130
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,830
See, you admitted it.

131
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,440
I admitted it to her!

132
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,070
What?! He was lying?!

133
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,790
Curse you, you crafty tactician!

134
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,580
80 million may have
been an exaggeration,

135
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,710
but I do have great men
under my command!

136
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
Like maybe three people?

137
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,350
She saw through it!

138
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,050
R-Run!

139
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,700
H-Hey, you guys! Don't run away!

140
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,630
I've never heard of pirates
using slingshots before!

141
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,880
You're neat!

142
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,870
Hey, you! Don't insult me!

143
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,250
I'm a very proud man!

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,630
Because of my great
pride, people call me...

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,090
"Proud Usopp"!

146
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,350
You saw it yourself just now!

147
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,890
My slingshot skills are far
greater than your average pistol!

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,350
Now that you've drawn your pistol,
put your life on the line.

149
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,300
Huh?!

150
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,730
I'm saying those aren't
for threatening people.

151
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,270
What you're looking at
now are real pirates!

152
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,940
Now that you've drawn your pistol,
put your life on the line.

153
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,860
Huh?!

154
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,940
I'm saying those aren't
for threatening people.

155
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,870
R-Real pirates definitely have way
more punch behind their words...

156
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,640
Awesome...

157
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,070
We stole those lines!

158
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,100
Eh?

159
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,770
From Shanks, a pirate I respect!

160
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,850
S-Shanks?!

161
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,530
You know Red-Haired Shanks,
the great pirate?!

162
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,130
Yeah.

163
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,590
Your dad's Yasopp, right?

164
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,440
Eh?

165
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,300
Yeah, Yasopp is my old man...

166
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,200
But how do you know that?

167
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,180
"Food"

168
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,710
Good, huh?!

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,710
I met him when I was a kid!

170
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,520
So my old man's on Shanks' ship?

171
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,870
Yep! You guys look the same,

172
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,230
so when I first saw you, I wondered...

173
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,470
Really?!

174
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,520
My old man's on such
an awesome ship?!

175
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,010
I dunno about now,
but I bet he's still with him.

176
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,060
After all, your dad was
a good sharpshooter!

177
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,580
Awesome!

178
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,530
That's nothing. I could even shoot
an ant right between the eyes!

179
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,480
Y'know, Luffy,

180
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,310
I got a kid named Usopp,
just about your age!

181
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,820
You've already told me
lots of times! I'm sick of it!

182
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,900
What?!

183
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,850
Well, I'm gonna keep on
tellin' you more about him!

184
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,370
It was sad to say goodbye,
but there was no other choice!

185
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,800
There was but one reason:
the pirate flag was calling me!

186
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,200
Stuck! Stuck!

187
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,010
Usopp. I heard enough about
you to make my ears sore.

188
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,220
Yasopp was a great pirate!

189
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,550
Yeah, huh?!

190
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:15,020
I'm proud of my old man, who leapt
onto these possibly endless seas...

191
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,480
...to live with his life on the line!

192
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,760
Then that makes this easier!

193
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,730
Do you have any friends in this
village who know how to sail...

194
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,730
...and anyone who
can supply a big ship?!

195
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,380
As you can see, it's just a tiny village...

196
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,500
Sorry, but we can't
live up to your hopes.

197
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,400
On the top of the hill...

198
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,900
There was a huge mansion.

199
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,650
Say! Do you know them, Usopp?!

200
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,320
Think you could ask them
to help pay for one?

201
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,000
You can't go there!

202
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,680
I-I just remembered
something I hafta do!

203
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,510
I have lots of influence here!

204
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,220
Eat and drink as much as you want!

205
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,680
Alright! Later!

206
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,390
Why was he in such a rush?

207
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,390
You wish to see Usopp?

208
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,940
Not this again...

209
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,250
May I? I want to talk to him.

210
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,900
That will not do.

211
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,560
That man is the village's
biggest exaggerator!

212
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,090
For someone in your weakened state,

213
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,950
Usopp's exaggerations
would be too much to handle!

214
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,020
But...

215
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,080
Your late parents firmly
instructed me to protect you...

216
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,670
...to the fullest of
my abilities, Miss Kaya.

217
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,250
Now then, I'll leave
your medicine here.

218
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,940
Please be sure to take it.

219
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,500
Cheapskate.

220
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,580
"Cheapskate" will do just fine.

221
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,770
What's bad is bad.

222
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,570
Pardon the intrusion--

223
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,620
Usopp-san!

224
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,620
Heya! You seem as down as ever!

225
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,470
I'm sorry!

226
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,610
I'd really like to invite
you in as a real guest...

227
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,560
...but Klahadore refuses to allow it...

228
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,770
He's not a bad person, though.

229
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,350
Don't sweat it!

230
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,640
After all, I am a brave
warrior of the sea!

231
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,840
I'd only feel cramped inside a house!

232
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,190
So what adventure are you
going to tell me today?

233
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,900
Hmm, let's see...

234
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,170
Alright!

235
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,040
The story of when I fought the
giant goldfish at the South Pole...

236
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,000
...when I was five!

237
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,140
Goldfish?

238
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,160
Yeah! What first shocked me...

239
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,280
...was the immense size of its poop!

240
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,950
It was so big that I landed on it,

241
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,370
thinking it was solid ground!

242
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,290
Is this really the place?!

243
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,570
Yeah, the pirates dragged him inside!

244
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,900
We gotta save him!

245
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,300
But they're real pirates!

246
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,070
They might've grilled and eaten him!

247
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,730
You idiot!
It's old hags who eat people!

248
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,770
Alright! Get ready, you guys!

249
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,850
This will be the most epic battle
since the Usopp Pirates' formation!

250
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,780
Yeah!

251
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,790
The Usopp Pirates have arrived!

252
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,960
What're they?

253
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,870
The captain is gone!

254
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,060
You don't think he...

255
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,370
H-Hey, pirates!

256
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,870
What'd you do with
our Captain Usopp?!

257
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,010
--What'd you do with him?!
--What'd you do with him?!

258
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,970
That meat was yummy!

259
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,980
Meat?!

260
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,440
Don't tell me the captain...

261
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,780
W-What?! What did you do?!

262
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,670
If you're lookin' for your captain...

263
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,850
...we ate him.

264
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,340
Old hag!

265
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,500
What're you looking at me for?!

266
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,650
You just had to say something stupid!

267
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,140
Whew, it was just a joke?

268
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,220
Huge!

269
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,350
If our captain ran off at
this hour, he'd be here.

270
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,310
Oh? What's he come here for?

271
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,900
To lie!

272
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,570
That's a bad thing!

273
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,290
He's not bad! He's great! Right?!

274
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,690
Yeah! He's great!

275
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,700
How does that work?

276
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,580
Kaya, the girl who lives here,
is weak, and she's had depression...

277
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,570
There was a ship
stopped near the goldfish,

278
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,370
and on it was a pirate
bigger than even a mountain!

279
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,120
ever since her parents died
from an illness a year ago.

280
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,620
His face was hilarious!

281
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,050
Even though she has lots
of money, she's so sad.

282
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,090
So our captain tells his special
made-up stories to make her laugh!

283
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,550
'Cause our captain's
the best at telling lies!

284
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,420
Never heard of a pirate with
a face like that, have you?

285
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,980
Oh, so he's great!

286
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,190
Yeah!

287
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,930
I like the captain's meddling side!

288
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,080
I like his bossy side!

289
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,530
I like his exaggerating side!

290
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,840
So that's helped her
feel a little better?

291
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,490
Yeah, a lot better!

292
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,500
Great! Let's ask her for a ship after all!

293
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,460
It's thanks to Usopp
that she's gotten better.

294
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,150
Just getting in is impossible!

295
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,460
There are way strong
guards at the gate!

296
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,600
--Huh?
--Where'd Luffy go?

297
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,790
I'll go ask!

298
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,960
Wait, you're not gonna--?!

299
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,690
Gum-Gum...

300
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,010
H-His arms stretched!

301
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,140
He's a monster!

302
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,140
...Pardon...

303
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
--Hey!
--Wait, Luffy!

304
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,920
...the Intrusion!

305
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:45,160
...And so we escaped into the sky
atop a gigantic slingshot ball!

306
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,360
Huh?

307
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,370
Yahoo!

308
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,100
That worked great!

309
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,260
Did not!

310
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,470
A-Are you all right?!

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,300
Yeah! It's okay, it's okay!

312
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,470
They're new recruits who heard
all about me and came from afar...

313
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,940
...to join the Usopp Pirates!

314
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,890
No, not me!

315
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,100
I'm here to ask a favor!

316
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,790
A favor? Of me?

317
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,560
Yeah!

318
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
--We want a big ship...
--You, there!

319
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,200
What are you doing?!

320
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,560
Klahadore...

321
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,490
I don't appreciate you breaking
in here without permission!

322
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,750
Who's he?

323
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

324
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

325
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,840
before someone else could
beat me to it

326
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:52,510
If the world is going to change

327
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:59,510
before I can even attain my dream

328
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:06,590
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

329
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:19,340
so that my memories won't fade

330
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,870
Who does that butler think he is,
treating people like thieves?!

331
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,330
Yeah! We only came
inside to get a ship!

332
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,250
That has "thief" written all over it.

333
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,910
That weird guy's way more suspicious!

334
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,500
What's that ring?

335
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,260
Hey, look! That butler is
with him! What's going on?!

336
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,720
On the next episode of One Piece!

337
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,460
"The Weirdest Guy Ever!
Jango the Hypnotist"

338
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,530
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
