2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,820
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,150
Luffy was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,640
There is, however, an untold
story of the brothers...

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,920
...10 years ago in the East
Blue - Luffy and Ace as boys.

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,800
"Take Good Care of Him! A
Letter from the Brother!"

64
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,030
Ace is not dead!

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,900
Easy, easy, I know. I know how you feel.

66
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,550
But it's too risky to go to Gray Terminal now

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,770
since you're wounded and
there are troops everywhere!

68
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,400
--But...!
--It was a big fire! And chances are...

69
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,630
...slim but we all want to believe
that the boss and Ace are alive.

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,990
Dogra went there to look for
them now so trust him and wait.

71
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,710
Everybody's having a hard
time - not just you, Luffy.

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,880
--The fishing boat has been hit!
--How's the child?

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,510
He made the Celestial Dragon mad!

74
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,090
Sabo!

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,140
Damn! The ship is catching fire!

76
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,810
Why did they shoot me like that?

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,430
Saint Jalmack! There is a child on the ship!

78
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,900
When someone flies a black flag, he's
a pirate regardless of who he is.

79
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,440
But most importantly...

80
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,910
Dammit!

81
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,410
A commoner shouldn't cross
the path of my ship!!

82
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,260
Hey! What was that ship doing?

83
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,200
This is an important ceremony!

84
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,650
We don't
wanna put the Celestial Dragon in a bad mood!

85
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,400
Move the shipwreck already!

86
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,050
Guys!

87
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,550
Hey guys, those two...

88
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,720
What is it?

89
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,060
They're back!

90
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,950
I'm so relieved!

91
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,250
Ace... Boss...

92
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,230
She's severely wounded!
Hurry up and treat her!

93
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,400
Are you alright?

94
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,010
Ace!

95
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,660
Luffy!

96
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,140
Did you think that I was dead?

97
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,350
--But...!
--Why are you crying?!

98
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,470
I'm not dead, fool!

99
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,320
Easy, easy, that's enough.

100
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,930
Luffy is just happy.

101
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,210
Can I ask you about the night of the fire?

102
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,530
After we left with Luffy,

103
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,510
what happened to you and boss?

104
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,630
We fought against Bluejam...

105
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,700
And we barely defeated him.

106
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,210
And we tried to follow you guys right away

107
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,000
but the fire was blocking our way.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,170
Damn! There's no way out!

109
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,010
We have no choice!

110
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,090
--Wait!
--What are you doing?!

111
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,630
I have no choice since I told them

112
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,280
that I'd take responsibility
for bringing you home...

113
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,190
Follow my lead. Don't get
separated at any cost!

114
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,610
Dadan!

115
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,450
Hey, Dadan! Are you alright, Dadan?!

116
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,260
We finally made it through the fire

117
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,540
but Dadan got severely burned.

118
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,990
We managed to get to the riverside
in the In-Between Forest.

119
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,010
Stay with me! You can't die!

120
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,470
Thief!

121
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,770
Wait! Stop!

122
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,650
I went to the town to steal some
medicine and get something to eat

123
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,070
and tried to save Dadan's life.

124
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,080
You don't have to worry
about me so just go, Ace.

125
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,360
Cut the crap! I thought you were
responsible for bringing me home!

126
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,380
I won't allow you to die!

127
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,300
Hey!

128
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,840
Some survivors could be around here!

129
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,090
Don't let anyone get away! Get them!

130
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,220
Yes, sir!

131
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,690
Okay, okay, we see.

132
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,940
In any case,
I'm glad that you both survived!

133
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,810
Sorry that I made you worry.

134
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,580
I can't believe what
happened to Gray Terminal.

135
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,570
I wonder if Sabo is worrying about us.

136
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,910
--Banzai!
--Banzai!

137
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,290
Another rude commoner could
appear at any minute.

138
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,500
--Watch carefully.
--Yes, sir!

139
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,350
I wonder how's Sabo doing?

140
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,300
But I'm glad that Ace is back
and Dadan is recovering.

141
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,770
Ace, at that moment...

142
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,600
I won't run!

143
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,440
Why didn't you run?

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,230
I can't help getting fired up sometimes.

145
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,120
I'm always afraid that if I run,

146
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,560
I'll leave something important behind.

147
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,070
At that moment...

148
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,660
Luffy was behind me.

149
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,450
I don't know but I think that's why.

150
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,420
Even when he faced a cloud
of enemies beyond his power,

151
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,590
Roger would never run away.

152
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,850
Was he suicidal? Running
away is a strategy, too.

153
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,000
That's right but he'd never do that.

154
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,520
Because he'd leave the
people he loved behind.

155
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,190
If he ran, he would put his crew in danger.

156
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,320
Actually, "he wouldn't run
away" isn't quite right.

157
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,950
He wouldn't let the enemy have
a chance to go after his crew.

158
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,330
He'd change into a sort of
demon in those situations.

159
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,620
He once destroyed a country's entire military

160
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,960
because they talked badly about his crew.

161
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,080
He'd become violent when angry.

162
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,740
He was short-tempered and selfish.

163
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,340
But he was naive and straightforward
like a child at the same time.

164
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,680
That's because his early life was like Ace's.

165
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,810
He hated to lose those he loved.

166
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,920
He was that reckless but he survived,

167
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,070
and became the King of the Pirates.

168
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,530
Although he got a bad reputation,
his crew trusted him implicitly.

169
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,740
Even I as a Navy soldier
couldn't help respecting him.

170
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,210
That's why I decided to take care of Ace.

171
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,210
We're the ones taking care of him!

172
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,090
Huh? Have something you want to say?

173
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,420
No, I don't.

174
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,510
The people of the world still hate Roger.

175
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,090
And while Ace hates his father,

176
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,760
it really is "like father, like son."

177
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,600
Alright! Let's see which
one of you will win...

178
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,810
Dogra!

179
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,450
You were looking for Ace and Dadan, right?

180
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,300
They're back!

181
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,860
Oh yeah? That's great.

182
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,450
W-What?! Sabo is...

183
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,660
Stop lying, you fool!
Don't even joke about it!

184
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,710
Stop, Ace!

185
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm not lying or joking
about it! It was so sudden!

186
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,460
I could barely believe what I saw!

187
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,590
I thought I was dreaming!

188
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,050
Shut up! Sabo went back to his family's home!

189
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,640
How could he be at sea?!

190
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
That's right! He went home!

191
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,840
A hoodlum like me can
understand how he feels!

192
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,560
People don't always wanna
go back to their home!

193
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,900
If he was really happy,
he wouldn't go out to sea!

194
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,780
He wouldn't go out to sea by himself
with a black flag on his ship!

195
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,840
Sabo...

196
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,680
He wasn't happy!

197
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,010
I was all by myself even if I had parents!

198
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,930
Why?! Why didn't we go
there to take him back?!

199
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,270
Where is the guy who killed
Sabo now?! I'm gonna kill him!

200
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,900
K-Kill the Celestial Dragon?!
That's impossible...

201
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,780
I'll make him pay!

202
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,900
Wait, Ace!

203
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,780
Stop it, you little shit!

204
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,950
Move...

205
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,830
Outta my way!

206
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,210
How can you be so confident even
though you're not that strong?!

207
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,460
What can you do?! They'll just kill you!

208
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,860
You'll die and people will
forget you by tomorrow!

209
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,860
You're just a nameless kid!

210
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,010
Sabo was killed by this country! This world!

211
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,930
What can you do about it?!

212
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,600
Your father changed the world by his death!

213
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,130
When you become a man that important,

214
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,810
then you can do whatever you want!

215
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,650
Tie this fool up!

216
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,820
Y-Yes, ma'am!

217
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,450
Sabo!!

218
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,410
Damn!

219
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,360
Shut up! Stop crying like a girl, Luffy!

220
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,660
Have you come to your senses, Ace?

221
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,710
--Untie him.
--Yes, ma'am.

222
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,320
Hold on.

223
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,960
--Where's Luffy?
--He's been crying all night and he's sleeping now.

224
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,260
Boss! You're not gonna believe this!

225
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,970
We got a letter from Sabo!

226
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,930
TO MY BROTHERS AT MT. CORVO FROM SABO

227
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,930
He must've sent it before he went out to sea!

228
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,720
Give it to me!

229
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,520
I'm not gonna go to the town!
It's for us, isn't it?

230
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,320
"Ace, Luffy, I hope you guys
weren't hurt in the fire."

231
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,200
"I'm worrying about you both but
I believe that you're okay."

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,460
"I'm sorry to say it, guys, but when you
get this letter, I'll already be..."

233
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,480
"...out on the sea."

234
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,010
"Things led to things and I decided
to set out to sea before you."

235
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,310
"My destination will be anywhere but here."

236
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,940
"I'm gonna become stronger
and become a pirate!"

237
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,440
"The three of us have to become
the freest pirates ever."

238
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,320
"One day, let's meet up again somewhere."

239
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,180
"Somewhere on the wide open sea!
Definitely, someday!"

240
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,920
"By the way, Ace, which of us
do you think is the bigger brother?"

241
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,150
"Two big brothers and one little brother."

242
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,390
"It's odd but our brotherhood
is my treasure."

243
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,310
"Luffy is still a weak crybaby but..."

244
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,730
"...he is our little brother
so take good care of him!"

245
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,770
How could they call themselves
observers?! They're partying everyday!

246
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,350
They haven't covered Sabo's story...

247
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,570
I heard that his parents didn't take action.

248
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,910
His parents are nobles

249
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,670
but they're powerless against the World
Government and Celestial Dragons.

250
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,290
How's Luffy doing?

251
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,000
He still isn't eating much.

252
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,290
But he still eats twice as much as we do!

253
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,420
I bet Sabo's death really got to him...

254
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,740
Ace! Luffy!

255
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,580
We gotta set out to sea someday!

256
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,710
Let's get out of this
country and live freely!

257
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
So from now on,

258
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,880
we're brothers!

259
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,740
How much longer are you gonna lie there?

260
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,120
The treasure that we were hiding
in the forest is all gone.

261
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,260
The survivors from Bluejam's crew took
it or maybe the military found it.

262
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,790
I don't know where it went.

263
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,120
But I don't care about the treasure anymore.

264
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,430
That was the pirate savings that
I was gonna share with Sabo

265
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,890
but Sabo didn't need it after all.

266
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,140
So I'll just let it go, too.

267
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,570
It's no use having treasure
if you can't even protect it.

268
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,980
A-Ace... I...

269
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,110
I wanna become stronger!

270
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,620
More, and more...

271
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,580
More and more, more and more...

272
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,510
More, more and more, more and more...

273
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,380
More and more, more and more...

274
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,090
I wanna become even stronger!

275
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,310
Then I can protect anything or anyone!
I don't have to lose anybody!

276
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,430
I beg you!

277
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,770
Ace, please don't die!

278
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,530
Cut it out! Worry about yourself first!

279
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,650
You're far weaker than me!

280
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,620
Listen carefully, Luffy!

281
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,290
I'll never die!

282
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,750
Uh-huh.

283
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,240
Sabo told me to take care of you, too.

284
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,050
I promise that I'll never die!

285
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,000
How can I leave a wimpy
brother like you behind?

286
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,260
Uh-huh... Uh-huh!

287
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,730
I'm not smart so I don't quite
know what really killed Sabo yet.

288
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,610
But it must be something opposed to freedom.

289
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,900
Sabo died before he knew freedom.

290
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,620
We exchanged that same cup
of sake and we're alive!

291
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,700
So listen, Luffy.

292
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,940
We have to live without leaving any regrets.

293
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,920
Uh-huh.

294
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,230
Boys from noble family...

295
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,850
...will become full nobles when they turn 18.

296
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,610
That's why I need to leave here by 17!

297
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:32,260
We gotta go out to sea someday...

298
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,190
...and live as we like.
Freer than anyone else.

299
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,440
Uh-huh!

300
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:44,960
That means we'll make enemies of many people.

301
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,230
Even the old man will become our enemy.

302
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,820
You gotta risk everything.

303
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,230
Let's go out to sea at 17!

304
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,800
And we will become... pirates!

305
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,090
Luffy and Ace are stricken with grief,

306
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,150
but they hold on to their
dream of becoming pirates

307
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,010
and set off toward the future again.

308
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,470
Their day of departure will come...

309
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,480
To achieve the dream that
Sabo was unable to realize!

310
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

311
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,110
"To Live Up to the Promise!
Departures of Their Own!"

312
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,510
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
