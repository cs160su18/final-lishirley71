00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,360
2 years have passed since the war between...

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,870
...the Navy Headquarters, The Seven Warlords, and the Whitebeard Pirates.

4
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,380
On the desert island north west of the Maiden Island - Ruskaina...

5
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,090
Luffy!

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,610
Yeah! I'm coming!

7
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,680
I can't believe it. It's been 2 years already.

8
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,510
Hey!

9
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,790
Look carefully. She's my friend.

10
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,880
Luffy, the ship is ready to sail out at any moment!

11
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,890
Okay, thanks!

12
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,800
That's amazing.

13
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,310
He's the boss of the island now.

14
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:11,230
But because I became friends with them, I couldn't eat them.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,610
They look yummy.

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,890
It's okay, Luffy.

17
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,930
We put everything that you like on the ship.

18
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,280
And I think I'll be a good wife since I'm thoughtful like that.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm not gonna get married. Thank you for the food!

20
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,830
I can't help loving you even if you're so bitter!

21
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,480
Rayleigh left 6 months ago.

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,160
He must be waiting to see you at Sabaody.

23
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,840
He was done teaching me the basics in first 18 months.

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,160
I have to say goodbye to you guys and the island.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,930
Alright...

26
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,220
Let's go!

27
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,990
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates, once attained everything this world has to offer.

28
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,830
The words he uttered just before his death drove people around the world to the seas.

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,300
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,880
Find it! I left everything this world has to offer there!

31
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,800
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,560
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

33

35
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,930

SHAKKY'S RIP-OFF BAR

91
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,200
It's been 2 years.

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,050
It went by fast when I look back now.

93
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,660
Yeah.

94
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,110
I can't wait to see how much they've grown.

95
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,540
Don't be hasty.

96
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,700
We don't even know if they can all get together safely.

97
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,530
Because they're infamous throughout the world now.

98
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh!

99
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,430
Ah, you're the first to arrive.

100
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,040
What? Nobody has arrived yet?

101
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,270
They never change.

102
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,280
"The Beginning of The New Chapter! The Straw Hats Reunited!"

103
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,130
OVER 10 DAYS LATER AT A BAR

104
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,760
Did you know that the Navy HQ has been relocated?

105
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,180
What? Was it?

106
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,470
Yeah, they switched its place with the G1 branch

107
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,890
symmetrically over the Red Line.

108
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,840
That's how determined the new Fleet Admiral after Sengoku is.

109
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,900
After all, he set up the HQ in the sea where The Four Emperors operate.

110
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,130
But thanks to the switch, the HQ has less sway here

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,040
so there are more lawless areas on this island.

112
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,270
Hmm, no wonder this town seems rougher than 2 years ago.

113
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,530
Hey, did you see this?!

114
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,380
Yeah, I was shocked, too.

115
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,430
I can't believe the Straw Hats have surfaced again!

116
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,760
Yeah, no one has heard from them for

117
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,140
2 years so we thought they were dead.

118
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,520
URGENT CREW NEEDED

119
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,520
I can't believe they're recruiting!

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,550
Pirates who survived through the first half of the

121
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,200
Grand Line keep coming to this island.

122
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,190
So he wants to expand his group here to run wild in the New World!

123
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,580
It's so exciting! Maybe I wanna join!

124
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,140
No way!

125
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,580
There are people with bounties over 100 million on the island now.

126
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,230
They're not gonna take you for sure!

127
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,300
What?!

128
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,610
Hey, old man! Give me a drink!

129
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,160
And something to eat, too! As much as you have!

130
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,070
Y-Yes, right away!

131
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,650
Hey, could they be...

132
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,280
I have no doubt! They're...

133
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,570
The Straw Hats...

134
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,160
GROVE #33 SABAODY PARK

135

A CONCERT HALL SABAO DOME

136
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey, don't say that!

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,430
Can't you do anything...?

138
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,770
Tickets are sold out! Of course they are!

139
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,150
It's the world tour of the superstar Soul King Brook!

140
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,770
And today is the last show!

141
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,760
The place is already packed!

142
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,850
Manager!

143
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,420
I'll put on a great show today!

144
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,040
Yes, that'd be nice!

145
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,210
Your TD is doing very well and they were sold over million copies now!

146
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,900
You certainly are the king of soul music!

147
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,530
Listen to the crowd!

148
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,810
Soul King! Soul King! Soul King! Soul King!

149
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,100
Manager...

150
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,480
Before the concert,

151
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,150
I have something important to tell you.

152
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,610
What is it?

153
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,280
Come on, baby!

154
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,710
Yeah!

155
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,330
Because I'm a skeleton, it's...

156
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,390
Bone!

157
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,470

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,980
Bone!

167
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,330
It's nonsense to become macho just to attract women

168
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,480
Soul King is mysterious

169
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,380
He's nothing but bones!

170
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,320
I can't believe it... How selfish can he be!

171
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,690
Hey, give me a Transponder Snail!

172
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm not gonna let you do whatever you want, Brook!

173
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,250
Let's make today a great anniversary!

174
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,690
I've missed Sabaody.

175
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,410
I'm finally back.

176
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,100
Women! Real ones!

177
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,150
Ah, there's no doubt!

178
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,690
There are actual ladies in front of me!

179
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,430
These are the real ladies that I've longed for

180
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,110
every single day, on this island!

181
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,410
Viva Sabaody!

182
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,910
I need lady!

183
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,910
Sanji-kun!

184
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,120
We'll leave you here.

185
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,990
I don't want to part but see you again somewhere!

186
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,790
I don't wanna see you again!

187
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,760
Thank you for the ride! Say "hi" to Ivan! Bye!

188
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,270
I'm a real man - Sanji!

189
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,420
Just come back from hell!

190
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,730
You know what they say?

191
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,720
Boys can't help swearing at a girl they love.

192
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,680
I know. It happened to me.

193
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,980
I don't wanna let him go!

194
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,570
Wait for me, Nami-san, Robin-chan!

195
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,910
Ah? Did I hear it wrong?

196
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,710
A 55 million berries bounty?

197
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:06,430
A PIRATE "STRAW HATS" CAPTAIN - MONKEY D. LUFFY

198
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,060
Check the poster once again!

199
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,660
It says "At least 70 million berries bounty."

200
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,430
We're not gonna deal with captains with less bounty.

201
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,710
How did you guys even get here safely?

202
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,230
Dammit!

203
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,520
Go away, pest.

204
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,730
Don't you know that I'm Dragon - the Revolutionary's - son?!

205
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,690
NAVIGATOR - NAMI

206
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,860
SHIPWRIGHT - FRANKY

207
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,550
We don't need some half-ass!

208
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,860
Because we're the chosen pirates!

209
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,490
SNIPER - SOGEKING

210
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,050
We're in another league.

211
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,490
Don't think that just anyone can join us.

212
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,120
Go home.

213
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,920
He's so merciless. Straw Hat Luffy!

214
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,590
Can't be helped - he has achieved a lot.

215
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,010
Hey, Franky. How many people we got so far?

216
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,760
About 100 people.

217
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
3 whole pirate groups joined us.

218
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,700
10 of them are with a bounty.

219
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,410
That's good. 2 of the 10 are high-profile rookies.

220
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,650
"Wet-Haired" Caribou and "Blood Splatter" Coribou

221
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,360
who are known for killing Navy soldiers.

222
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,910
They're captain brothers with 210 million and 190 million bounties.

223
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,500
It's great to have them!

224
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,500
Let's get more followers! Old man, we need more drinks!

225
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,550
Y-Yes!

226
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,460
Hurry up!

227
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,720
Oh? And you woman, who's been there for quite a while.

228
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,560
Stop drinking alone quietly and come join us!

229
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,850
She's cute.

230
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,570
Hey sister, can't you hear me?!

231
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,660
Hey, he's talking to you.

232
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,750
That's okay. I'm waiting for someone.

233
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,010
What?

234
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,460
She turned him down.

235
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,580
Hey, hey, you better say yes!

236
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,690
He's Straw Hat Luffy!

237
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,540
Remember?

238
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,470
He's the crazy pirate who burst into the War of the Best 2 years ago!

239
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,720
You know him, right?!

240
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,770
Waiting for someone?

241
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,370
He must be a wimp who'll apologize in tears

242
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,570
once he hears Captain Luffy's name anyway!

243
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,270
So come here now!

244
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,310
I'll only say it once!

245
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,700
You're no match for me so I'm not gonna drink with you!

246
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,410
What?

247
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,250
Do you understand, Straw Hat... who?

248
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,530
Did you say "who"?!

249
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
I'm Straw Hat Luffy!

250
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,350
Hey, you better apologize! You're in danger!

251
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,200
Huh?

252
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,530
You've got a lot of nerve!

253
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,250
Let me handle it.

254
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,110
Hey you! You're a funny woman.

255
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,870
Then I'll make it easier for you.

256
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,590
Are you gonna drink with Captain Luffy?

257
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,260
Or do you wanna die?

258
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,270
For your information, I have a bounty, too.

259
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm a cat burglar - Nami!

260
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,410
Don't mess with me!

261
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,080
Sure Kill: Green Star...

262
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:00,910
..."Devil"!

263
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,050
Huh?

264
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,710
Wh-What is this?!

265
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,720
What is this?!

266
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,960
Help me, Captain!

267
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,800
You fool! Stay away from me!

268
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,970
What is that plant?

269
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,100
So, young lady, do you wanna drink with me?

270
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,650
Usopp, long time no see!

271
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,600
I can't believe it! You became stronger!

272
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,450
You have blossomed yourself!

273
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,960
What?! She had been waiting for that geek?!

274
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,980
Did you do that?

275
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,710
Yes, I did! That's my new weapon - Pop green!

276
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,050
It's not like I was watching the sea and doing nothing for 2 years.

277
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,010
I'm sorry

278
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,230
but I no longer belong to the weak trio with you and Chopper.

279
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,980
I became a warrior who isn't fazed by anything!

280
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,910
Hey, dude! Is this what you've done?

281
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,090
What?! Sogeking?! Why?!

282
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,860
Usopp, forget about them!

283
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,240
Let's go somewhere else.

284
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,700
I need a favor to ask of you, too.

285
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,050
Wait, you guys!

286
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,140
Huh, Luffy?!

287
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,160
Let's go!

288
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,190
Hey, ma'am, you haven't paid yet!

289
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,580
Keep the change!

290
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,470
Damn, this is setting a bad example for others!

291
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,290
Bring them back!

292
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,040
Dammit!

293
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,130
Huh?! What are these black bubbles?!

294
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,270
What the hell is this? A cloud?!

295
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,150
Wh-What happened?!

296
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,690
...So I studied about the new technology...

297
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,250
Really? You were in the sky?

298
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,010
Find those two and kill them!

299
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,660
I have a report! At the Sabaody Archipelago...

300
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,910
What? The Straw Hats?!

301
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,210
Yes, sir! Word is that they're recruiting new crewmembers there.

302
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,810
Let the headquarters know about it.

303
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,840
If he's really alive, that's not good.

304
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,320
Call soldiers up right away!

305
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,760
And intensify the search on the Sabaody Archipelago!

306
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,020
Did I shake them off?

307
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,460
Brook's concert?

308
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,960
The Straw Hats' recruitment?

309
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,870
What is going on?

310
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,660
What is Soul King?

311
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,430
There's no mistake...

312
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,560
There isn't even a scratch on it.

313
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,300
Sorry to keep you waiting, Sunny!

314
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,850
We'll be sailing out soon!

315
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,820
Grand-Bun is good, indeed!

316
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,360
I wonder how everybody's doing.

317
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,740
I hope I can see them soon!

318
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,000
--Mister, make it bigger!
--Thank you!

319
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,720
Hey, you alright?! Hey!

320
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,050
He's horrible!

321
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,860
He shot her out of the blue!

322
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,010
Terrible!

323
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,450
Hey, stay with me!

324
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,730
Why did you do that?!

325
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,690
Did we do something to you?!

326
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,370
I said "sorry"!

327
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,330
I mistook her for someone else!

328
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,610
I'm sorry. I was looking for a couple like you guys.

329
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,320
A long-haired woman and a long-nosed man.

330
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,330
You mistook her and shot her on the spot?!

331
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,580
How horrible he is! Straw Hat Luffy!

332
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,880
Huh? Don't tell me that you have something against me!

333
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,210
Looks like you do.

334
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,440
Don't hate me, hate those two!

335
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,770
Hey, stay with me! You alright?!

336
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,190
Find them, guys! Those two!

337
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,810
We can't just let them get away!

338
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,570
Kill them as a warning to others!

339
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,530
Oh, did it hit you? Sorry!

340
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,280
Bye!

341
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,960
What's wrong with him?

342
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,350
He doesn't know Straw Hat Luffy?

343
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,350
H-He's gonna get killed!

344
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,710
Wait a minute!

345
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,960
Huh?

346
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,760
The fake Luffy who appeared in front of Luffy

347
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,990
attempted to boost his crew's power

348
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,220
by calling them Straw Hats.

349
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,900
Facing the pistol-wielding fake,

350
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,430
Luffy's newly acquired powers activate.

351
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

352
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,490
"An Explosive Situation!
Luffy vs. Fake Luffy!"

353
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
