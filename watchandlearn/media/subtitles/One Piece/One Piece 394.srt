2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,820
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,750
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,000
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,640
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,210
The words he uttered
just before his death

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,210
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,800
Find it!

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,400
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,510
After landing on the
Sabaody Archipelago,

50
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,560
Luffy and friends gained
information from bar owner Shakky

51
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,560
about a coating craftsman
and eleven rookie pirates.

52
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,010
We're here! Sabaody Park!

53
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,190
Yay!

54
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,130
Camie's been kidnapped!

55
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,540
What?!

56
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,180
"Rescue Camie The Archipelago's
Lingering Dark History"

57
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,120
Damn, what's taking 'em so long?

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,590
Young Master!

59
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,520
They're here?

60
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,010
Yahoo! It's me, Handsome!

61
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,730
Oh, I mean, it's me, Duval!

62
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,580
And we're his men!

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
Hello, Young Master Black Leg!

64
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,160
Took you long enough,
Flying Fish Riders!

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,850
Hold on, Young Master!

66
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,520
We're the Rosy Life Riders now!

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,330
Fine, whatever! You're annoying!

68
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,430
Anyway, a mermaid has been kidnapped!

69
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,710
That's why I called for you!

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Eh?! You encountered kidnappers?!

71
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,170
What horrible villains!

72
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,970
Hey, now! You guys are
kidnappers too, you know!

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,310
It's like they say,
set a thief to catch a thief.

74
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,930
So you guys help out, too!

75
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,120
But of course!

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,850
Thank you for calling upon us!

77
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,700
Thank you!

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,190
Can we really count on these guys?!

79
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,280
By the by, I tried visiting
a town with girls in it!

80
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,860
Head! Head! Look, girls!

81
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,990
Nice. Let's go!

82
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,180
How was it?

83
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,300
It was great!

84
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,770
Hey there, girls!

85
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,910
Hello! I'm Handsome!

86
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,920
What do you say we take a drive
on the sea on my Motobalo?

87
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,550
And...?

88
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,070
I wasn't as popular
as I thought I'd be...

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,760
You can fix how you look on the outside,

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,900
but there's no fixing how
you look on the inside...

91
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,110
But that's all right!
I understand, Young Master!

92
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,440
We just need to find the mermaid
before she gets sold, right?!

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
That's right.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,160
I figure you must have some knowledge
of the Sabaody Archipelago.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,740
But of course!

96
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,240
These waters are
pretty much like our backyard!

97
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,980
You can count on us!

98
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay! Hop on!

99
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,600
We're gonna take these Flying Fish?

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,250
We sure are!

101
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,140
Okay! Ready when you are!

102
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,590
Right!

103
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,350
So, how're we gonna find her?

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Young Master!

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,760
Those of a trade know each other's ways!

106
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,970
I know of several kidnapping teams
that could be behind this!

107
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,360
We'll start by picking up
your Straw Hat friends

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,570
scattered around the
Sabaody Archipelago!

109
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,530
At the same time,

110
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,940
we'll figure out which kidnapping
team abducted the mermaid!

111
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,160
Let's go, men!

112
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,450
Alright! We're coming to
save you now, Camie-chan!

113
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,840
Hey, Duval! Go faster!

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,350
Young Master!

115
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,400
Motobalo is already at full speed!

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
Great! We're at full speed!

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
Eh?!

118
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,790
This is full speed?!

119
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,810
Let's go!

120
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,190
I hope it'll be all right...

121
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,730
Sanji! What are we going to do?!

122
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,460
Listen, Chopper!

123
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,530
Don't go anywhere,
no matter what!

124
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,140
I will send someone to get you!

125
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,180
Okay!

126
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,410
Hey, Luffy! Sanji says not to go--

127
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,410
Camie!

128
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,090
I think it's dangerous to split up
at a time like this, Brook...

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,390
Eh?

130
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,780
You're too calmed down!

131
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,720
This is a major shock, you know!

132
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,940
Camie was kidnapped!

133
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,150
She's gonna get sold and be a slave
for the rest of her life!

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,020
Chopper-san.

135
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,080
Sanji-san gave us precise instructions
about what we should do.

136
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,660
However we act, we'll spend the
same amount of time waiting.

137
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,330
I see!

138
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,750
Acting flustered won't solve anything.

139
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,630
In which case, why don't we spend our
time waiting calmly and tranquilly?

140
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,590
Oh! Now I see!

141
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,310
Head!

142
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,300
We've reached Sabaody Park!

143
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,570
Pick up one Straw Hat member each!

144
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,060
Right!

145
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,900
They were told to wait by
Public Transponder Snail #5,

146
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,070
which should be right around here!

147
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,130
There they are!

148
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,530
Two of them, down by those benches!

149
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,690
Hey, you two! We're here to--!

150
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,460
What are you guys relaxing for?!

151
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,590
Oh, Usopp-san is here to pick us up...

152
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,900
Luffy and the others went off somewhere,

153
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,600
but we tranquilly stayed put
like we were told to.

154
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,210
Let's go!

155
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,020
Operation: Save Camie
With Everything We Got!

156
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,720
All right! It's time to go all out!

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,690
Let's go!

158
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,300
He got mad at us, Brook!

159
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,450
I regret it!

160
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,900
I regret it a little now!

161
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,060
Keep checking up on all the kidnapping
teams on the archipelago!

162
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,630
Figure out who's behind this!

163
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,100
And don't forget to retrieve
the other Straw Hat members!

164
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,030
Roger! Let's split up!

165
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,230
Right!

166
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,760
Alright!

167
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,860
Hurry, Rosy Life Riders!

168
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,370
We have no time to lose!

169
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,010
That should be good enough.

170
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,710
Good enough, my ass!

171
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,390
Can't you do something about this cow?!

172
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,920
I should've ridden a Flying Fish, too!

173
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,910
Eh? Did you say "handsome" just now?

174
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,130
Hell, no!

175
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,720
You're the head of your gang, Duval!

176
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,850
Why aren't you the fastest
one in your team?!

177
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,330
Eh? What are you talking about?

178
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,780
Of course I'm the most
handsome person in my team!

179
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,860
Just step on it, you idiot!

180
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,450
Alright, here we go!

181
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,830
Hey! Any doctors here?!

182
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,340
You, there!

183
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,500
This is a general outpatient clinic!

184
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,000
What's wrong with him?!

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,220
He needs urgent care.

186
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,170
This is bad!

187
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,340
Let's see... Nope, no collar.

188
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,720
Does having a collar matter?

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,760
Yes.

190
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Medical treatment for
slaves costs 50% more,

191
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,730
so sometimes it's quicker
to buy a new one...

192
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,820
This guy is hurt, that's all.

193
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,190
You gonna help him or not?!

194
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,020
Yes, yes! Right away!

195
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,990
Carry him right inside!

196
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,010
What an annoying island...

197
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,040
Guess I'll head back to the ship.

198
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,760
Grove #1, as I recall.

199
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,330
"Human Shoppe"

200
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,260
A mermaid?

201
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,300
Get out if you're just
window-shoppin', kid!

202
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,660
Someone caught our friend!

203
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,600
Has anyone come here trying
to sell a mermaid, old guy?!

204
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,800
Any information at all!

205
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,390
If you know anything, please tell us!

206
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,780
Don't know nothin'.

207
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,900
Besides,

208
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,740
it's in your best interest not to stick
your nose into that kinda stuff...

209
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,380
You're sure nobody's come here
trying to sell a mermaid?!

210
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,160
I-I'm sure! No one's tried to!

211
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,570
Stop it, Straw Hat!

212
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,100
It'll be harder to look for her
if you cause trouble!

213
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,880
Y-You're free to look around
the place if you want!

214
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,220
Octoguy! Let's look around the shop!

215
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,880
Okay!

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,390
All these guys are
being caught and sold?

217
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,620
Camie...

218
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,640
Hey!

219
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,900
Well, Octoguy?! Pappagu?!

220
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,830
She's not here...

221
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,570
Camie!

222
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,260
Do you have any others, old guy?!

223
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,530
I don't got a warehouse,
so all you see here is all I got.

224
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,120
We have no choice!

225
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,370
Let's check elsewhere, Straw Hat!

226
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,060
Just a minute, now!

227
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,670
It sounds like you folks
are in real need of a mermaid!

228
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
You have a mermaid?!

229
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,830
The only mermaid I have
is this girl here: Marin!

230
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,010
"Marin"

231
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,100
I'll give you a discount! Whadya say?!

232
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,010
Please buy me, kiddo.

233
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,360
You ain't no mermaid!

234
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,660
You're just that old guy from earlier!

235
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
It's so hard to breathe underwater.

236
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,730
Hey!

237
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,930
C-Camie...

238
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,970
Camie!

239
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,860
Where are you?!

240
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,070
Whoa, check it out!

241
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,760
It's Straw Hat Luffy from East Blue!

242
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,830
That's him?!

243
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,200
It's possible she hasn't been sold yet.

244
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,330
If we can just figure out
which kidnapping team it was...!

245
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,760
Hey! There's no reason to cry that much!

246
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,880
We will find Camie!

247
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,670
Darn it...!

248
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,840
It's all my fault!

249
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,110
The amusement park is the perfect spot

250
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,350
for kidnappers to do their work!

251
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,310
I knew full well how badly
they want mermaids, and yet...!

252
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,400
Hey! Look at all these
kinds of ice cream!

253
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,700
What do you guys want?!

254
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,300
Wait, let me choose some, too!

255
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,800
Wait here a minute, Camie!

256
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,250
Okay!

257
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,820
Choose something yummy for me too!

258
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,910
I don't want that to be my
last conversation with Camie!

259
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,740
It's my fault!

260
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,750
I let her go to the amusement park!

261
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,390
Yeah,

262
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,550
I've always dreamed of this,
ever since I was a little girl!

263
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,810
I've never been so high up before!

264
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,590
I'll cherish this memory forever!

265
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,510
Thank you!

266
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,780
I dunno why exactly,
but she was really happy!

267
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,440
Going to the amusement park
was a good idea!

268
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,770
No, it wasn't!

269
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,180
In fact,

270
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,500
it's not even a good idea for fish-men
or merfolk to come to these islands!

271
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,650
But Hachi was so intent
on being helpful to you guys that--!

272
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,490
Pappagu! Don't say any more!

273
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,460
What are you talking about?!

274
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,280
Why isn't it good for you guys
to come to these islands?!

275
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,910
Uhh, well...

276
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,330
Kidnappers aren't the only enemies
Camie and Hachi have here.

277
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,750
All of the people living on this
archipelago are their enemies!

278
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,300
200 years ago?!

279
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,280
Yes.

280
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,050
A terrible history that actually
took place up until 200 years ago...

281
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,720
The fish-man and merfolk races
were classified as fish

282
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,850
and were persecuted
by people all over the world.

283
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,570
Everyone looked down on them.

284
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,190
They looked down
on those strong fish-men...?!

285
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,280
No one can stand up to the
power of sheer numbers.

286
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,980
The persecution continued unabated

287
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,360
until the World Government
declared its friendship

288
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,020
with Fish-Man Island.

289
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,050
One other relic of humankind's
terrible history

290
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,060
is the culture of human
trafficking and slavery...

291
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,760
And on this archipelago,
it's still quietly condoned.

292
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,270
Which is why I wondered
if they might still discriminate

293
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,990
against fish-men and merfolk here.

294
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,730
Discrimination?

295
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,880
Unless you take these islands
for what they are,

296
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,190
you'll only make a fool out of yourself!

297
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,120
Which is why I should've stopped Camie,

298
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,940
even if it meant being mean and strict!

299
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,110
Is that why Hachi and Camie are both
concealing their identities here?

300
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,700
I only hope it's an ungrounded fear...

301
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,580
Girl! Robin!

302
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,490
Franky!

303
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,160
Will you quit calling me
"girl" already?!

304
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,060
Get on the Flying Fish!

305
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,750
The mermaid's been kidnapped!

306
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,670
Camie-chan's...

307
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,960
...been kidnapped?!

308
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,900
Camie...!

309
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,170
I'm sorry, Straw Hat.

310
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,680
I wanted to help you out,
but I caused you trouble instead...

311
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,060
What're you guys talking about?

312
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,570
There isn't one thing
you guys should be sorry for!

313
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,970
All three of you are my friends now!

314
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,720
We will rescue Camie, no matter what!

315
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,930
So stop crying!

316
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,450
Straw...!

317
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,100
You're...!

318
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,720
Straw Hat!

319
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,270
It's the Flying Fish Riders!

320
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,680
We've been lookin' everywhere
for ya! Jump on!

321
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,430
Octoguy! Can you jump up?

322
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,020
Y-Yeah!

323
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,210
Pappagu!

324
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,700
Octoguy!

325
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,450
I'm okay!

326
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,370
Pappagu!

327
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,540
Let's go save Camie!

328
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,410
Straw Hat...!

329
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,460
"Sabaody Archipelago - Grove #1"

330
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,630
"Human Auctioning House"

331
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,230
Oh, Peterman!

332
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,390
Have an item to auction, do you?

333
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,160
Is there still time to submit an entry?

334
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,560
Today's big item is a giant.

335
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,850
Your entry won't fetch a very high price
unless it's really something!

336
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,770
Here, have a look for yourself.

337
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,360
Wh-Whoa! That's a mermaid!

338
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,370
Hey! Where did you catch it?!

339
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,780
That's a secret.

340
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,960
This is gonna be today's
main attraction!

341
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,130
Alright, make sure you
sell it good, now!

342
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,560
Oh, that top-quality item will sell!
For a lot!

343
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,860
Come by later to get your money!

344
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,930
I look forward to it!

345
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,890
What a pleasant surprise,
Saint Roswald! Saint Shalria!

346
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,300
Welcome!

347
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,510
I humbly ask that kneeling and such
be unnecessary inside the building...

348
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,680
That will be fine.

349
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,560
They would make for poor
auctions otherwise.

350
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,420
Thank you very much!

351
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,320
Please, use the VIP seats!

352
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,240
Brother Charloss is certainly
taking a long time!

353
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,540
That's what he gets
for riding a sluggish human.

354
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,990
If you're going to ride something,
make it a fish-man.

355
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,540
They have ten times
the strength of humans.

356
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,480
Celestial Dragons...

357
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,800
Slaves...

358
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,020
Human Shoppes...

359
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,570
That's...!

360
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,890
Captain Kid from South Blue!

361
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,560
Compared to the callowness
of greedy authority figures,

362
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,040
the criminals of the world
have much more humanity.

363
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,990
It's because scum rules
the world that new scum is born.

364
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,260
Don't they understand?

365
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,860
We're as endearing as we are mean.

366
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,920
Right, Killer?

367
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,080
Without a doubt.

368
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,090
If there's someone interesting,
should we buy 'em?

369
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,380
Boss. Look...

370
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,490
I recognize him...

371
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,390
Trafalgar Law, from North Blue.
Worth 200 million...

372
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,000
I've heard pretty bad rumors about him.

373
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,730
He's got a bad attitude, too!

374
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,940
Disco-san!

375
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,410
We have an incredible item today!

376
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,230
Today's big entry is a giant, right?

377
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,070
I already know.

378
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,400
You can count on me.

379
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,330
I'll make sure it sells
for a high price.

380
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,410
Are the by-bidders ready to go?

381
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,160
No, not that! It's a mermaid!

382
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
A young mermaid!

383
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,560
It's going to be one heated auction!

384
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,130
Seriously?!

385
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,580
Let me go! You're hurting me!

386
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,700
Let go, I said!

387
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,110
Stop!

388
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,400
Hey, quit thrashing around!

389
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,940
We need to figure out your collar size!

390
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,450
Damn this collar!

391
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,730
If only...

392
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,370
If only it wasn't for this!

393
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,980
Damn it!

394
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,690
No! Hatchin!

395
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,860
Why, you!

396
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,130
You'd best behave
unless you wanna get hurt!

397
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,390
Hold it!

398
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,600
Don't be roughhousing
our important merchandise!

399
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,300
Disco-san!

400
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,780
Oh, is this the mermaid
that just came in?

401
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,470
Yes, sir!

402
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,840
How truly rare!

403
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,750
Lively and strong!

404
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,560
This should fetch a high price!

405
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,860
Who submitted it?

406
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,300
The Hound Pets.

407
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,920
Peterman, huh?

408
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,600
He does damn good work.

409
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,040
And yet, the Flying Fish Riders
haven't submitted anything this time...

410
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,840
Well, in any case,
there's no question this'll sell for a lot!

411
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,050
Blehhh!

412
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,300
What was that look for?!

413
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,680
Damn you!

414
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,560
You're just a lousy fish!
Don't get any wrong ideas!

415
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,400
Stop, Disco-san!
That's important merchandise!

416
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,790
It'll lose its value if you hurt it!

417
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,050
At least kick it in the stomach
or somewhere that's covered up by clothes!

418
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,530
Hatchan is going to beat you up so bad!

419
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,990
Why, you...! Still talking back, huh?!

420
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,300
Hey! Gimme that collar!

421
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,080
Y-Yes, sir!

422
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,870
I'll put the collar on it myself...

423
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,540
Hold it still, now!

424
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,090
No!

425
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,350
Disco-san?!

426
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,430
Hey! What happened, Disco-san?!

427
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,360
The auction's just
about to start, too...!

428
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,260
Doctor! Get a doctor!

429
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,510
Hey. Old man.

430
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,380
Don't play innocent.

431
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,450
That Haki energy just now
was you, wasn't it?

432
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,820
Just who are you?

433
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,180
A simple old man who coats ships.

434
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:10,150
"Former Vice Captain
of the Roger Pirates"

435
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,260
I just have a real penchant

436
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,990
"Silvers Rayleigh,
the Pirate King's Right Hand Man"

437
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,170
for young girls, you see...

438
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,380
We're not gonna let Camie-chan be sold!

439
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,010
Bastard...

440
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,640
You think I'll let this auction happen?!

441
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,070
That's enough. Let's go, Sanji-kun!

442
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,970
Nami-san!

443
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,850
If we can't use force,

444
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,530
then we'll get Camie back
using their rules!

445
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,210
On the next episode of One Piece!

446
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,090
Time Limit -- The Human Auction Begins

447
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
