2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,810
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,760
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,660
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,620
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,630
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,820
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,540
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,840
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,400
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,200
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,280
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,500
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,710
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,210
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,370
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,660
Fire!

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,060
What are you--?!

26
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,880
Luffy-san!

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,340
Straw Hat?!

28
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,240
That doesn't work!

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,830
I told you I was strong!

30
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,230
W-Who the hell are you?!

31
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,620
I'm Luffy!

32
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,250
The man who's gonna
be King of the Pirates!

33
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,660
"Morgan vs. Luffy!
Who's the Mysterious Pretty Girl?"

34
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,340
W-What?!
The King of the Pirates?!

35
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,460
Do you even know
what that means?!

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,560
King of the Pirates
is King of the Pirates!

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,200
Are there any other meanings?

38
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,770
I was shocked, too!

39
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,160
But Luffy-san is serious!
That's how he is!

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,240
He intends to become the King of the Pirates

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,860
and obtain this world's
ultimate treasure... the One Piece!

42
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,280
Here's your treasure!

43
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,120
Which is yours?
I couldn't tell, so I brought three of 'em.

44
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,560
All three are mine.

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,960
I use the Three-Sword Style.

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,150
You'll take 'em, right?

47
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,500
If we fight together now, you'll
be a government-defying villain!

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,840
Would you prefer that, or
being killed by the navy like this?

49
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,720
What are you, the devil's son?!

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,630
Well, whatever.

51
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,640
I'll be your pirate,
if I'm just gonna die here instead!

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,020
Hurray! So you'll join my crew?!

53
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,030
Alright! Woo-hoo!
This is great! Alright!

54
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,860
Okay! Now untie these
stupid ropes already!

55
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,970
What... is he?

56
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,660
He flung the bullets back!

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,920
He's no ordinary human,
that Straw Hat...

58
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,480
Must've eaten one of
those rumored Devil Fruits!

59
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,230
--A Devil Fruit?!
--The hidden treasures of the sea?!

60
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,120
The Devil Fruits...

61
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,210
Whoever eats one is said to
gain seemingly unworldly abilities.

62
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,200
The power to breathe fire...

63
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,500
The power to cause tsunamis...

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,630
There are all sorts of rumors,

65
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,970
but there are many types, and
almost nothing is known about them.

66
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,840
It's said the secrets to
them lie in the Grand Line...

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,110
but there's no question
Straw Hat just displayed a devil power!

68
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,830
Hurry! Hurry!

69
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,210
Damn! These knots are tight!

70
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,580
Hey! Quit wastin' time!

71
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,750
No matter who they are,

72
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,370
everyone who opposes me gets executed!

73
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,540
If guns won't work,
then chop them to death!

74
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,640
Huh, that's weird! It got tighter instead!

75
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,130
Give me a damn sword!

76
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,390
Luffy-san!

77
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,400
Roronoa Zoro!

78
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,980
So cool!

79
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,400
Move and you're dead.

80
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,760
Too scary!

81
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,600
I'll be a pirate. I promise you that.

82
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,040
I'm officially a criminal,
now that I've fought the navy.

83
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,270
But I'll tell you this right now.

84
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm only going to fulfill my ambition!

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,090
Ambition?

86
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,060
To be the world's greatest swordsman!

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,970
If I wind up having to give that up,

88
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,100
you'd better accept
responsibility and apologize to me!

89
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,960
The world's greatest swordsman?
That sounds great!

90
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,570
The King of the Pirates would
need no less than that on his crew!

91
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,840
You sure talk big.

92
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,670
At this point, whether it's as
a criminal or whatever else,

93
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,200
I will spread my name throughout the world!

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,790
What're you standing around for?!
Slaughter them this instant!

95
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,590
Duck, Zoro!

96
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,750
Gum-Gum Whip!

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,180
Y-You did it! Incredible!

98
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,760
What the hell are you?

99
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,720
I ate the Gum-Gum Fruit.

100
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,470
Gum-Gum Fruit?

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,080
A rubber person!

102
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,870
So he does have Devil Fruit powers!

103
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,240
Captain! We don't stand
a chance against them!

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,790
These guys are crazy!

105
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,860
We can't even handle Zoro by himself!

106
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,360
This is a direct order!

107
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Everyone who spouted weakness just now...

108
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,200
must now shoot themselves in the head!

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,220
I have no need for weakling soldiers!

110
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,670
These troops are mental!

111
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,110
Luffy-san!

112
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,090
Crush this navy!

113
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,840
Rankless, low-status bums have
no right whatsoever to defy me!

114
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,760
I am Navy Captain
"Axe-Hand" Morgan!

115
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,150
I'm Luffy!
Nice to meetcha!

116
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,660
Die!

117
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,420
T-The captain!

118
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,040
R-Runt...

119
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,170
Die!

120
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,220
No thanks!

121
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,950
C-Captain Morgan is...

122
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,640
being trounced completely...

123
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,170
And you call yourself a navy?!

124
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,870
You've destroyed Coby's dream!

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,110
Hold it, Straw Hat!
Check this out!

126
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,610
I said hold it!
Are you stupid?!

127
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,490
Pay attention!
I have a hostage here!

128
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,370
Helmeppo-sama!

129
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,470
Hey.

130
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,480
If you value this guy's life, don't move!

131
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,280
One move and I'll shoot!

132
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,070
Luffy-san! I don't
want to get in your way!

133
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,430
Even if it means dying!

134
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,880
Yeah, I know!

135
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
Give it up, stupid son!

136
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,920
Coby really is ready to die!

137
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,560
Don't move!

138
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,860
I told you not to move!
I-I'll shoot!

139
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,600
Behind you!

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,920
Gum-Gum...

141
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,160
I am Navy Captain
"Axe-Hand" Morgan!

142
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,670
--Dad! Kill him, quick!
--...Pistol!

143
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,630
Nice!

144
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,600
Zoro.

145
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,750
My pleasure, Captain.

146
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,270
Captain Morgan's been beaten!

147
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,400
--Unbelievable!
--These guys are insane!

148
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,740
If anyone else still wants
to catch us, come forward!

149
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,250
--Hurray!
--We're free!

150
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,030
--Yahoo!
--Morgan's reign is over!

151
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,210
Hurray for the navy!

152
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,430
Huh? Everyone's happy
their captain's been beaten...

153
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,680
Everyone was just afraid of Morgan!

154
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,780
What's wrong, Zoro-san?!
Are you hurt?!

155
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,940
I'm... hungry...

156
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,440
Sorry!

157
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,410
Just endure it for a while!

158
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,400
Doesn't seem to be in here, either...

159
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,540
Yes! A chart of the Grand Line!

160
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,570
I knew they had one!

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,030
"I've flashily taken the map! Buggy"

162
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,030
T-This isn't a chart!
What is this mark?!

163
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
Captain Buggy...

164
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,760
The man known as Buggy the Immortal...

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,530
I'm stuffed!

166
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,280
I was definitely at my rope's end,

167
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,090
having not eaten for three weeks!

168
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,710
Huh? You're finished already?

169
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,460
How the heck can you have
a bigger appetite than me?!

170
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,100
It tastes good! Right, Coby?

171
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,930
Thank you for treating me to food, too...

172
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,390
It's no problem!
The town has been saved, after all!

173
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,200
You really are amazing!

174
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,400
Yep, I am!
And I'm gonna be even more amazing!

175
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,150
'Cause I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

176
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,270
And I even have a crew!

177
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,820
So, how many others have
you gathered besides me?

178
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,220
You said you were in the
middle of gathering a crew.

179
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,480
To be King of the Pirates,

180
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,740
you must have
a good number gathered.

181
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,790
Just you.

182
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,620
Huh?! Then...

183
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,170
Yep! Just us two!

184
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,250
We're gonna call just
us two a pirate crew?!

185
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,650
What's wrong with that?
We are strong!

186
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,140
What about a ship?
Where's your pirate ship?

187
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,350
There.

188
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,720
That?

189
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,150
We'll have a ship this big before long!

190
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,530
And how's that?!

191
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,430
And I'd like a pirate flag, too!

192
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,580
Yeah! Yeah, yeah! So cool!

193
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,440
I think Luffy-san was born
without any sense of planning.

194
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,830
Did I really make this guy my captain?!

195
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,320
Well, we'll get more
crew members before long!

196
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,270
Hey, hey! Where are you guys gonna go to now?

197
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,900
Isn't it obvious?! The Grand Line!

198
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,290
You still only have two members!

199
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,400
There's no way you can go there!

200
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,540
No way! No way! No way!

201
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,780
Is the Grand Line that terrible of a place?

202
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,840
Naturally!

203
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,160
You know this world
has two oceans, right?

204
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,800
And the giant continent that cuts
them right in two is the Red Line.

205
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,060
Supposedly, there's a town right
in the middle of the Red Line,

206
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,600
and the Grand Line goes
through it at a right angle...

207
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,510
and stretches around the world.

208
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,210
It was said that Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates,

209
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,110
once obtained everything
this world has to offer,

210
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:41,000
and before he died, he said he left
the great One Piece treasure there,

211
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,850
so pirates everywhere have
since set sail for the Grand Line!

212
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,440
It's now an intense battlefield,
and even called a pirate graveyard!

213
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,390
I've heard from patrons before...

214
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,370
that whoever enters the
Grand Line never comes out alive...

215
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,560
But the One Piece is somewhere there,

216
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,590
so we're going there!

217
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,550
Guess it can't be helped!

218
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,590
Not you too, Zoro-san?!

219
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,690
What's it matter?
You're not going, are you?

220
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,960
N-No, but I'm worried about you!

221
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,180
Is that so wrong?!

222
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,910
Luffy-san and I haven't
known each other long,

223
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,570
but we are friends!

224
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,520
Right?

225
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,480
Yeah! We're gonna part ways,
but we'll always be friends!

226
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,260
Since I was a little kid,
I've never had friends...

227
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,910
Much less anyone who
would fight for my sake...

228
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,000
But more than anything,
I never tried to fight for anything...

229
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,280
But you two taught me
how to live for my beliefs!

230
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,680
I've decided to make
my childhood dream come true!

231
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,500
I want to join the navy!

232
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,680
Shouldn't you be more
worried about yourself, then?

233
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,400
Even if you were just a chore boy,

234
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,610
you did spend two years
on Alvida's pirate ship.

235
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,780
Don't underestimate the
navy's info-gathering skills.

236
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,360
If they find out about that,
you'll never get to join.

237
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,940
N-Now that you mention it...

238
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,030
Pardon me!

239
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,500
Is it true that you are pirates?!

240
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,760
Yeah. We gained a member
and became a pirate group just now!

241
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,560
We appreciate that you saved our
base and this town from that tyrant!

242
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,510
However, now that we know you are pirates,

243
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,640
in the name of the navy,
we cannot stand by quietly!

244
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,700
You will leave this town at once!

245
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,240
Out of obligation, we will refrain
from contacting headquarters.

246
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,320
Hey, navy guy!
How can you talk like that?!

247
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,090
Even you guys were
subdued and terrified of Morgan!

248
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,200
We owe these people our lives!

249
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah! Yeah!

250
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,780
Well, guess we should go!

251
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,320
Thanks for the food, lady!

252
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,760
You guys are leaving already?

253
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,030
Yeah.

254
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,440
Aren't you part of their crew?

255
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,870
Eh? I...

256
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,590
I'm...

257
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,900
Hold it!

258
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,840
Well? Is he?!

259
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,870
I know what he's done until now.

260
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,620
Luffy-san! You wouldn't!

261
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,260
There was this really fat pirate lady,

262
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,360
I think her name was Ahiruda.

263
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,660
Luffy-san!

264
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,530
If they find out I was on a pirate ship,

265
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,090
I'll never get to join the navy!

266
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,760
And she had this iron club.
Man, she was an ugly hag!

267
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,740
And for two whole years, this guy was her--

268
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,420
Please don't!
Please don't, Luffy-san!

269
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,100
Now you've done it, you bastard!

270
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,850
Damn you!
Damn you! Damn you!

271
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,750
Stop that!

272
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,170
We won't allow you to cause
any more trouble in this town!

273
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,390
Hey! You've gone too far.
That's enough.

274
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,480
It's very clear that you
guys aren't crewmates!

275
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,810
Now leave this town at once!

276
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,620
On purpose...

277
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,650
He did that on purpose...

278
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,990
For me...

279
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,300
He purposely got me
riled up to make me hit him...

280
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,000
Even in the very end,
I wound up relying on him!

281
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,220
Nothing's changed at all!

282
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,930
Am I an idiot?!

283
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,640
Please!

284
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,340
Please...
let me join the navy!

285
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,400
I'll gladly do chores or anything else!

286
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,900
If it means I can be a marine!

287
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,820
Lieutenant Colonel! I'm against the idea!

288
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,510
I still don't fully trust this kid!

289
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,450
There have been cases of
marines being pirate spies!

290
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,150
We'll first need to
conduct a background check...

291
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm a man who will become a navy officer!

292
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,320
Countless comrades of ours
have been killed by pirates.

293
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,310
Don't take the navy lightly.

294
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,270
Then...

295
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,400
Permission to join granted!

296
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,520
Yes, sir!

297
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,570
"I've flashily taken the map! Buggy"

298
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,470
That was a pretty lame act.

299
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,320
Wouldn't be shocked if they saw through it.

300
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,250
Coby'll handle the rest on
his own now. I just know it.

301
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,150
It's a nice way to leave, though.

302
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,210
Being unable to turn back
'cause everyone hates you--

303
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,970
it's pirate-like!

304
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,520
That's true!

305
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,890
Luffy-san!

306
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,270
Thank you! I'll never
forget all you've done for me!

307
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,850
I've never heard of a pirate
being thanked by a marine...

308
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,850
Let's meet again sometime, Coby!

309
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,660
--Luffy-san...
--Bye!

310
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,370
All hands, salute!

311
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,290
See ya!

312
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,900
That's a great friend you have there.

313
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,880
Yes, sir!

314
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,670
Our salute just now is
in violation of naval law!

315
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,680
Therefore, we will all go without
food for three days! Understood?!

316
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,560
Yes, sir!

317
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,820
I'm sure...

318
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,350
I'm sure we'll meet again
sometime, somewhere, Luffy-san!

319
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,440
Even if we're divided
as pirates and marines...

320
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,760
let's meet again someday!

321
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,440
Alright!
Our pirate crew finally sets sail!

322
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,090
Looks like some pretty good
adventures'll be waiting for us.

323
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,150
I will be King of the Pirates!

324
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,360
You really seem obsessed
about this King of the Pirates thing.

325
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,920
Is there some sorta reason for it?

326
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,520
No reason. It's just...

327
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,150
It's just?

328
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,210
I swore to a certain man that...

329
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,620
...someday I would gather a great crew,

330
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,750
find the world's greatest treasure,

331
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,390
and become King of the Pirates!

332
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,370
This straw hat knows!

333
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,090
I see...

334
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,610
Alright! Let's go!

335
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,060
Set sail for the Grand Line!

336
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

337
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

338
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,310
before someone else
could beat me to it

339
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

340
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,530
before I can even attain my dream

341
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:06,650
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

342
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:19,640
so that my memories won't fade

343
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,950
Geez, you don't even
know how to navigate right?!

344
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,660
--Do you know how?
--No!

345
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,110
Ahh! Hey, stop rocking the boat!
My hat'll fall off!

346
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,260
Is your straw hat that important?

347
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,290
Yeah! It's my treasure!

348
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,250
I have to return it to him
after I'm King of the Pirates!

349
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,950
Who's "him"?

350
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,040
On the next episode of One Piece!

351
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,540
"Luffy's Past!
Enter Red-Haired Shanks"

352
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,740
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
