2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,570
Zoro's coming down!

48
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,030
Cien Fleurs! Spider Net!

49
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,670
Eat this! You're still a zombie!

50
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,250
Special Attack! Salt Star!

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,170
How do you like that?

52
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,140
I-It wasn't enough!

53
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,110
Not for his massive body!

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,150
Heavy Gong!

55
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,300
D-Damn it, Luffy!

56
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,860
I don't know any of you losers!

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,020
I am Moria-sama's servant, Oars!

58
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,130
"You're Going Down, Absalom!!
Nami's Lightning Attack of Friendship!!"

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:20,540
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

60
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,920
Huh?

61
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,430
But some outsiders got thrown into the mix.

62
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,890
So that leaves the guy
I saw in the straw hat,

63
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,570
the orange-haired woman, and the cool hero.

64
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,710
I'm still missing three people.

65
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,320
Where could they be? Hmm?

66
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,520
No! I hate roaches! Gross!

67
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,790
Usopp 10 Ton...

68
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,500
No, no, no, no...

69
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,590
...Hammer!

70
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,550
She's awake!

71
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,100
--Not the hammer!
--Perona-sama!

72
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,510
--I hate cockroaches! Hurry and
get them off of me! Hurry!

73
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,510
--Perona-sama, please come to your senses!

74
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,310
--I hate roaches! Ew, yuck!
--There aren't any cockroaches.

75
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,480
We removed the sticky stuff
that was on your hand.

76
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,150
Where am I?

77
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,940
Your foe is long gone.

78
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,610
Perona-sama, you were
out cold when we found you.

79
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,210
What did he do to you?

80
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,210
I can't believe someone knocked you out!

81
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,750
Who trashed the mansion?
Was this the pirates' doing?

82
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,960
The pirates are certainly causing mayhem,
but this looks like Oars' handiwork.

83
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,090
Oars?!

84
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,670
What was he...?

85
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,560
As a matter of fact, word has it
Oars wiped out the General Zombies.

86
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,940
The ultimate corps?!

87
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,320
So we can't control Oars?!

88
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,070
Well, I couldn't say one way or--

89
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,580
--Guys!
--Brothers!

90
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,920
Woman!

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,980
O-Oars?

92
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,720
C-Come to think of it,
I heard he stepped on Hogback-sama.

93
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,890
What?!

94
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,760
Woman!

95
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,230
Is the woman around?

96
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,900
Woman!

97
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,900
He's looking for a woman? Yikes!
I've gotta get away from here.

98
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,610
Between the pirates and Oars,
Thriller Bark is toast!

99
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,280
Hurry and gather up the treasure and food!

100
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,950
We're going to stuff it into their
pirate ship and make a break for it.

101
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,710
Whose ship?

102
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,670
The Straw Hats'! We're escaping
on their ship, so hurry it up!

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,750
Okay, we're on it!

104
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,550
Sheesh...

105
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,010
Woman!

106
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,470
Perona-sama!

107
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,140
Kiss the bride.

108
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,890
Yeah, let's speed through this.
I'm growing impatient!

109
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,690
Smooch...!

110
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,150
What?! W-Wait! What're you doing?!

111
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,610
No, stop it!

112
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,660
You've come to? Grah, give it up!

113
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,710
Once I give you this binding kiss,
you will become my lifelong companion!

114
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,620
I've already turned you down,
you perverted invisible beast!

115
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,460
I'm still at that age where
I want to go on adventures!

116
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,880
Shut up and rejoice! You will be
the King of the Grave's wife,

117
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,550
making you the Queen of the Grave!

118
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,090
Ew! What the hell?!

119
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,090
Heh, heh!

120
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,810
Curse you, Namizo!

121
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,450
--Lo...
--Lola!

122
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,040
Namizo...! Why, you...!

123
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
How dare you try to steal him from me?!

124
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,580
You said that you were shipping us!
That was a lie, wasn't it?

125
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,550
You were doing the opposite of shipping us,
and trying to steal Ab-sama.

126
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,550
You're a two-faced jerk!

127
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,590
W-Wait, Lola! Just a second.

128
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,640
I've been out cold this whole time.

129
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,270
I don't even know what's going on.

130
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,640
Oh, I'm in a wedding dress.
Why am I wearing this? Cool!

131
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,810
There's nothing "cool" about this, traitor!

132
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,270
Wait! You've got it all wrong!

133
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,230
Damn it, Lola! Not only
did you crash my wedding,

134
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,030
but now you have the gall
to attack my bride?!

135
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,490
Shut up and marry me!

136
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,320
Hell, no!

137
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,160
Ab-sama, I bet you don't know, do you?

138
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,320
A-About what?

139
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,500
This woman's real name is Namizo!

140
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,630
"She" is actually a "he"!

141
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,180
What?!

142
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,430
No, that can't be true... Seriously?!

143
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,980
Oh, yeah. That's what I told Lola.

144
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,390
So you're wasting your time!
Pursuing him will get you nowhere!

145
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,840
Do you get it now?

146
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,860
I've been chasing a man this whole time?

147
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,910
And I came within an inch of kissing him?

148
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,620
But I checked out his body in the bathroom...

149
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,000
I made it just in the nick of time.

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,540
I'm sure this is the place.

151
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,920
Usopp, Chopper! Wait out in the hallway.

152
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,760
Okay...

153
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,230
I must have imagined that...

154
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,190
Nami, you okay?

155
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,780
Everything's fine, so don't look in here!

156
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,940
Okay.

157
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,240
Th-That was close.

158
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,720
Boing! Boing!

159
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,010
Ba-boing!

160
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,890
All of the bouncy parts were there...

161
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,650
Make yourself scarce, Namizo!

162
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,730
Stop it, Lola!

163
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,270
Hey, hog! Stop it, Lola!

164
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,740
Beat it!

165
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,660
She isn't hitting me?

166
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,220
Namizo...

167
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
Lola?

168
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,620
Run for it, Namizo! I will hold him back!

169
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,790
I came to rescue you, my friend!

170
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,710
Lola!

171
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,380
Ab-sama!

172
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,760
Now, if that's sunk in, swear your
vows to me instead, Absalom!

173
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,270
Lola...

174
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,890
There goes the bride!

175
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,400
Your bride is right here!

176
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,190
I'm certain that she is a woman!

177
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,860
Lola, stay out of my way!

178
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,800
Lola!

179
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,890
Lowly zombie!

180
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,490
You've made me... waste my energy on you!

181
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,090
Oh, smart move!

182
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,400
Have you decided to stop running?

183
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,840
That's right. It's not like...
you could escape, anyway.

184
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm an invisible man!

185
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,190
Thunder Charge!

186
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,730
How dare you?!

187
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,070
I think you and Beast Man
would make an awesome couple!

188
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,070
I was totally shipping you!

189
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,260
Really?

190
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,890
No one has ever encouraged me to
pursue my feelings for him before...

191
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,000
You're the first person to offer
such kind words of support.

192
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
I... I...!

193
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,300
Raise your head, my friend.

194
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,590
This is what you call "friendship."

195
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,470
I am Namizo. Please call me "Nami."

196
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,110
Friendship...? Nami!

197
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,520
Namizo...

198
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,360
Lola?

199
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,820
Run for it, Namizo! I will hold him back!

200
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,160
I came to rescue you, my friend!

201
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,160
How dare you hurt Lola?!

202
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,400
That's right! Dive into my arms!

203
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,700
Swing Arm!

204
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,570
It's not like that'll do anything!
That's why I'm going to...

205
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,420
Huh?

206
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,940
Ab-sama!

207
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,070
That's right! Dive into my arms!

208
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,430
Ab-sama!

209
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,770
Why? It didn't even faze him
on top of the bridge...

210
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,270
Sure enough, he had already reached
his limit after fighting that man.

211
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,860
It's no wonder.

212
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,740
Well, it's all cool.

213
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,860
I won! Yay!

214
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,590
I must have hit some vital organs!

215
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,500
Lola!

216
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,550
Are you okay? Hang in there.

217
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,550
Thank you for coming to save me.

218
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,400
Why are you thanking me?

219
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,180
We're friends, aren't we?

220
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,240
But I used to be so scared
of you that I told you a lie.

221
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,850
I'm sorry. I'm actually a woman.

222
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,070
Silly! I know that.

223
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,820
Lola...!

224
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,680
More importantly, isn't Ab-sama wide open?!

225
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,870
Be my groom, Absalom!

226
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,540
Huh?

227
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,040
Are they here? Nope.

228
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,350
Wait!

229
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,100
Wait, darn it! Giant Shallot!

230
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,270
Stop already!

231
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,830
Hold up!

232
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,400
Man!

233
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,280
Shoot! I lost sight of him.

234
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,620
Gum-Gum Whip!

235
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,880
I can't find Moria!

236
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,520
Gum-Gum Whip!

237
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,380
Whip!

238
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,140
There he is!

239
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,440
Wait!

240
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,650
Wh-What was that all about?

241
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,060
Wasn't that Straw Hat just now?

242
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,640
But didn't Straw Hat say that
he would "kick Moria's butt"

243
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
and race off to the castle?

244
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,820
What was he chasing after?

245
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,410
I wonder what he's hunting down, don't you?

246
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,170
M-Moria!

247
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,980
He said he was going to kick my butt?

248
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,800
Do you seriously think
Straw Hat can pull that off?

249
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,980
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but that's impossible.

250
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,780
The most losers like you who hide in the

251
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,430
forest can do is spend your time praying.

252
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:03,010
Are they in here? Come on out,
Straw Hat! Woman! Cool hero!

253
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,360
Damn, that's one nasty monster.

254
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,720
He's insanely powerful and fast.

255
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,310
What was his name again?

256
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,430
Uh...

257
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,810
I'm pretty sure it's Rose.

258
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,970
No, that's not right!

259
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,120
It ended with an... "s."

260
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,310
--Hughes?
--No, I think you're getting colder.

261
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,700
Orse?

262
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,120
Hm? No, I still don't
think it's quite right...

263
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,580
It's Oars.

264
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,790
That's it!

265
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,290
Uh, I'm sorry. I still can't...

266
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,500
Yeah, we know how it is.

267
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,250
Could you give us some space?

268
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,000
Sure...

269
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,460
Try to avoid his attacks.

270
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,330
Okay...

271
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,970
Hey, Oars!

272
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,140
If Luffy's shadow is inside of you...

273
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,610
...you shouldn't underestimate the
underlying strength of your crew!

274
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,630
I can't believe Oars is able to replicate
Luffy's moves with that massive body!

275
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,970
Now that it's come to this, we'll have
to do "that." Let's teach him a lesson!

276
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,050
We'll show him the strength
of our powers combined!

277
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,270
No way...! Do you want
to do "that" here and now?!

278
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,980
Let's do it, guys!

279
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,350
Tactics #15!

280
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

281
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,150
"Knock Him Down!!
Special Attack: Straw Hat Docking?"

282
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
