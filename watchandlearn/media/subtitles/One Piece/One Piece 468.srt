2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,400
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,670
Luffy finally made it to Marineford
to rescue his brother, Ace!

61
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,800
There, the Whitebeard Pirates
are trying to get to Ace

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,960
and the Navy is standing in their
way. The battle is heating up!

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,170
Gum-Gum...

64
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,040
...Giant...

65
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,130
...Rifle!

66
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,640
Ace!

67
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,730
"Hard Battles, One After Another! Devil
Fruit Eaters vs. Devil Fruit Eaters!"

68
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,150
He beat the Giant!

69
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,930
Awesome, Straw Hat! You beat
the Giant in one sweep!

70
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,070
I'm back!

71
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,580
Straw Hat, I think we caught their attention!

72
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,250
Don't let them advance any farther!

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,630
Don't let the rookie get the best of you!

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,550
Luffy!

75
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,010
Get them!

76
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,270
Let's launch a frontal attack

77
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,690
THE BAY HEAD OF MARINEFORD

78
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,820
and join Pops inside the bay!

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,360
We gotta save Ace!

80
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,410
Drive the Navy out!

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,090
The Navy admirals! They're so strong!

82
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,130
But we can't stop!

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,840
We're gonna rescue Ace!

84
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,640
They're a bunch of fools!

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,820
Bazooka unit, fire at Whitebeard!

86
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,360
Pops!

87
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,080
Damn! Please don't do this!

88
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,540
Slash him to pieces!

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,540
Gum-Gum...

90
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,840
...Twin Pistol!

91
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,840
I'm gonna...

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,350
...rescue Ace! Don't get in my way!

93
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,310
Luffy! Why did you come?!

94
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,770
Why did any of them come?!

95
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,240
I deserve this! They don't have
to risk their lives for me!

96
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,160
We, the 2nd division of the Whitebeard
Pirates, will save our commander Ace!

97
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,480
Don't do this!

98
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,460
Everyone! Why are you
doing this for a guy like me?!

99
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,430
I'm your brother!

100
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,180
How stupid you are! Luffy! Pops!

101
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,940
Become my son!

102
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,330
What's wrong?

103
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,710
I'm ready...

104
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,460
...to accept anything
that's gonna happen to me.

105
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,840
I'll hold a helping hand.

106
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,180
I'll take the blade of punishment.

107
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,520
I won't make a scene anymore.

108
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,440
Because I feel sorry for them.

109
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,380
Start firing!

110
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,160
Gum-Gum...

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
...Balloon!

112
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,650
He's suddenly standing out in this battle!

113
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,780
Damn Straw Hat!

114
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,240
Captain Buggy, we need to
make a strong showing, too!

115
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,910
Let's beat Whitebeard now!

116
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,440
Alright! Let's do it!

117
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,610
Having said that, this war is crazy!

118
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,590
There're a
bunch of big-time pirates and the Navy soldiers!

119
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,700
I better keep quiet here...

120
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,180
Hey, you red nose!

121
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,500
What did you just call me?! I'm
gonna kick your ass, you bastard!

122
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,770
Huh?

123
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,690
Whitebeard!

124
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,860
I know you. You're the brat
who used to work under Roger.

125
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,780
It's been a while, huh? So you're alive.

126
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,290
Oh no! I drew his attention!
He's gonna kill me!

127
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,710
He's dead! He better run!

128
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,590
W-Whitebeard! That notorious Whitebeard is...

129
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,960
...talking to him! How cool!

130
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,720
I knew that you were a living legend!

131
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Why're they so thrilled?! Must be
nice if it's not your own problem!

132
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,520
You're accompanied by so many prisoners...

133
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,480
Are you here to challenge me?

134
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,270
Yes, he is!

135
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh, sorry. Captain had to say it.

136
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,650
Give it to him straight!

137
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,200
Dammit! I have no choice now!

138
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,790
Y-Yeah, at last we meet! Prepare yourself!

139
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,710
He's pushing his luck a bit too far!

140
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,670
Oh? I don't mind if you try to beat
me but what are you gonna do next?

141
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,680
There are more Navy soldiers
than you can handle.

142
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,970
In fact, they're more than I can handle, too.

143
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,150
Shouldn't we join ranks since we're
both pirates and knock the Navy down?

144
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,610
Then, you can beat me after that.

145
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,660
Oh my god! Whitebeard recognizes
you as a powerful man!

146
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,240
Like his equal!

147
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,490
No, Whitebeard called him a "brat!"

148
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,710
You can't fight against the Navy!
You think there's a chance to win?!

149
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,710
Yeah, if I go all out.

150
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,510
He's losing his grip on reality!

151
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,050
--You sure?!
--I got goose bumps!

152
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,510
I'm starting to think that
I can do it! I can do it!

153
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,560
I can see myself becoming
the King of this world!

154
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,690
Yeah, we can beat the Navy
if he and I join forces.

155
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,400
This is too great! I'll faint!

156
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,640
Alright, Whitebeard, I join
with you! If you insist!

157
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,990
Huh? Who does he think he is?!

158
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,660
Well, he's our Captain Buggy!

159
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,210
How many more things can
they take the wrong way?!

160
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,170
He is unbelievably easy to trick.

161
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,050
The red nose aside, the prisoners
behind him are something.

162
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,140
It's a pain to have them as our enemies.

163
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,210
And now, I must...

164
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,110
THE BAY HEAD OF MARINEFORD

165
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,860
Ships in the back,

166
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,900
come forward and deploy the backup!

167
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,850
Our forces are superior!

168
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,060
I have a report!

169
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,540
The pirates in the
back are also heading this way!

170
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,880
It's about time.

171
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,700
Forward unit at the bay head,

172
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,550
change the formation as Fleet
Admiral Sengoku instructed

173
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,260
All units, keep fighting
back and back up slowly!

174
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,560
--Did they stop firing?!
--They're backing up, too!

175
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,610
--There is disarray among the Navy!
--One more push!

176
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,270
Navy ships are coming from either side!

177
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,780
--It's too late!
--Let's charge into the bay!

178
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,100
Alright! It's our chance to
join Pops inside the bay!

179
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,320
Ring, ring, ring... Ring,
ring, ring... Clank!

180
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,750
This is Whitebeard.

181
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,710
Is Squard there?

182
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,710
Pops! Captain Squard... Oh?

183
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,260
He was in my sight a while ago
but it seems like he's gone.

184
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,040
That bastard.

185
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,850
He was all fired up to
strut his stuff to make Pops proud.

186
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,270
It can't be helped. Then,
DeCalvan Brothers...

187
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,770
--What is it, Pops?
--Pops, what is it?

188
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,360
Follow my lead and take
command of all pirates.

189
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,280
--Okay!
--Okay! And what's your lead?

190
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,240
Sink the Navy ships around you first.

191
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,490
What?! Pops, I think we can
make a frontal attack now!

192
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,870
Are you giving up?

193
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,840
I have a bad feeling about this situation.

194
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,130
I got it, Pops!

195
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,390
Pops, I got it! We'll tell the captains!

196
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,760
What?! Pops said that? Alright,
then I'll get the right side!

197
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,220
We'll take the left.

198
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,390
Okay, got it.

199
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,660
We'll take the right side.

200
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,020
If Pops says so.

201
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,530
I can head my ship in any direction.

202
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,200
Squard?! I haven't seen him. Really?!

203
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,870
I'll take the left side.

204
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,400
Fleet Admiral Sengoku! Pirates of
the New World changed their moves!

205
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,040
Yeah, they turned to the left and right.

206
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,460
They've started attacking Navy ships!

207
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,010
Good guess! Whitebeard must have sensed it.

208
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,660
He didn't fall for that cheap trick.
Maybe it was a bit too lame.

209
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,620
But he can't prevent a
thing just by sensing it!

210
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,600
Damn! There're too many enemies!
It's hard to break through!

211
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,050
Death Wink!

212
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,000
Heehaw!

213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,490
Ivan-sama, you're alright!

214
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,950
Ivan-chan, I wanna clear the way to Ace!

215
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,980
Jimbei!

216
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,530
Fish-Man Karate!

217
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,740
Death...

218
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,170
Gum-Gum...

219
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,380
5000 Brick Fist!

220
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,420
...Wink!

221
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,710
...Bazooka!

222
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,850
Advance!

223
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,600
Ace!

224
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,070
Stop Straw Hat and the others!

225
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,990
Straw Hat! I won't let you get through!

226
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,910
Moria!

227
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,020
You've got to fight me, Moria!

228
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,250
Jimbei!

229
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,660
I can handle you on my own, Moria!

230
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,650
You wanna fight me, Jimbei?

231
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,550
Alright! I have to get rid of you
in order to use zombie soldiers!

232
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,260
Go ahead, Luffy-kun! Don't waste any time!

233
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,180
Thanks, Jimbei!

234
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,910
Pffft! It's a pity to think
that I'm letting Straw Hat go!

235
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,150
Jimbei, you think you can
beat me on the land?! Huh?!

236
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,110
I never thought that Jimbei
would become our enemy!

237
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,640
The Seven Warlords are our crucial
forces! We shouldn't fight each other!

238
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,240
--Huh?
--What's wrong?

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,510
There's something wrong with my shadow.

240
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,090
Now, fight for me, shadows
of the damned Navy soldiers!

241
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,450
Did you know that I get more powerful

242
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,730
by taking in the shadows of other people?

243
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,030
You have no chance to beat me, Jimbei!

244
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,990
You got bigger.

245
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,720
But getting stronger by
taking other people's power

246
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,790
doesn't make you any better, Moria!

247
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,000
Silence! I couldn't care less about
it! All that matters is winning!

248
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,800
Now, I'm gonna take your shadow!

249
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,980
Spend the rest of your life
in the dark undersea, Jimbei!

250
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,570
Let me have your shadow!

251
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,700
You're so quick for a hulking fellow!

252
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,660
You're the hulking fellow here!

253
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,420
Fish-Man Karate!

254
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,130
Sharkskin Palm Thrust!

255
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,350
Shark Brick Fist!

256
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,350
You let go of the shadows
that you've taken in!

257
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,250
You need to train yourself more!

258
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,800
Now, you need to let me through, Moria!

259
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
I have to hurry forward!

260
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,130
Wait, you bastard! The fight is not...

261
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,480
Straw Hat!

262
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,940
Move, Tashigi!

263
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,580
Ouch! You are... Smokey!

264
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,080
I see you finally, Straw Hat!

265
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,210
Straw boy!

266
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,290
Kuma! You're so persistent!

267
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,380
Oh, no, no...!

268
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:08,220
Oh yeah, that jutte is tipped with
Sea Prism Stone! That bastard!

269
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,520
Second Gear!

270
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,650
I'm gonna take care of you!

271
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,790
Gum-Gum...

272
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,780
...Jet Gatling!

273
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,990
White Launcher!

274
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,780
You've got much stronger than before!

275
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,740
Straw Hat!

276
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,290
He disappeared!

277
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,410
That's fast! Where is he?

278
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,310
It seems like you became
stronger than before, as well!

279
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,320
Your power is not enough to beat me!

280
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,030
Commodore Smoker pinned Straw Hat!

281
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,990
Amazing!

282
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,200
Damn! Get your jutte off of me!

283
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,480
Now I know why Dragon...

284
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,750
...helped you at Loguetown, Straw Hat!

285
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,880
Dragon got in my way at that time but
this time I won't let you get away!

286
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,970
D-Damn!

287
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,430
You! Leave him alone!

288
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,520
She got me although my body is smoke!

289
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,730
Kicking shouldn't hurt him!

290
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,610
Th-That's...! The pirate
empress saved Straw Hat!

291
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,570
Hancock! What are you doing?! Are you
gonna resign from The Warlords, too?!

292
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,160
Shut up! I'm deafened by my own anger!

293
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,500
How could you hit and pin down my beloved?!

294
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:06,260
I won't let you survive! I have
never felt this much anger before!

295
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,550
I'm gonna cut you up and feed you to beasts!

296
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,760
That's the Haki of Kuja!

297
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,780
Hancock!

298
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,150
Yes!

299
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,980
You called me Hancock again!

300
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,900
Kuma! Kuma, that's enough!

301
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,520
It's me! Did you forget my face?!

302
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,290
If you don't stop, I'm gonna fight
back although I'm a gentle person!

303
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,880
I don't know how you know him
but you may as well give up!

304
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,310
It's no use talking to him, Emporio Ivankov,

305
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,480
commander of the Revolutionaries army!

306
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,090
You...! What do you mean?!
What's wrong with him?!

307
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:55,100
You're a friend of
Bartholomew Kuma I suppose.

308
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,020
He was once called Tyrant
Kuma and now he is...

309
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,060
...dead.

310
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,400
What are you talking...

311
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,030
Kuma is...

312
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,240
...dead?!

313
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,460
Ivankov and Bartholomew
Kuma were once comrades,

314
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,470
but despite Ivankov's desperate
cries, Kuma's cruel attacks persist.

315
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:39,730
Then Doflamingo shares the shocking
truth about what happened to Kuma.

316
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

317
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,860
"Kuma's Transformation!
Ivan-san's Blow of Anger!"

318
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
