2
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,710
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,070
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,810
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,110
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,680
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,470
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,270
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

14
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,250
They landed on Punk Hazard;

15
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,490
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen

16
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,600
and were held captive, confined in a cage,

17
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,120
by Caesar Clown who rules the island

18
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,620
and were exposed to Shinokuni,
a weapon of mass destruction.

19
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,090
But they broke out of
the cage thanks to their ally ---

20
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,210
a Warlord - Trafalgar Law's tactful maneuvers

21
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,460
and were reunited with their crew.

22
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,370
Now, outside of this laboratory
is filled with the poison gas

23
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,970
but there is one passage

24
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,310
that could lead you directly to
the sea bypassing the air outside!

25
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,100
There is a big door marked
"R-66" that is an entrance

26
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,820
to the passage to the sea.

27
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,460
I'd rather not have to create a massacre
but I can only give you two hours.

28
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,950
Those of you who stay longer than that,

29
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,350
I can't guarantee your safety.

30
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,240
There are children who were kidnapped
two years ago in this laboratory!

31
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,960
Retrieve them and head for the "R-66" door!

32
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,510
Wait for me, Momonosuke!
I'll save you at any cost!

33
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,890
Hey, Luffy!

34
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,650
Get a grip!

35
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,930
This is just the beginning of the New World!

36
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,520
Yeah, sorry! I won't drop my guard again!

37
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,080
With Luffy in the lead, they start to move

38
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,340
to rescue the children and kidnap Caesar!

39
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,070
Gum-Gum...

40
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,420
...UFO!

41
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,220
"Tashigi's Tears! G-5's
Desperate Breakthrough Plan!"

42
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,880
Why?!

43
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,850
Why are they inside of the building?!

44
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,470
The brokers are watching this!

45
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,210
Damn! What humiliation!

46
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,290
The Straw Hats and the
group of Navy soldiers are...

47
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,030
...running toward the passage to escape!

48
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,880
What should I do? What should I do?

49
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,140
What should I do?!

50
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,470
The Master! He's like a devil!

51
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,610
But looks like everybody's okay! I'm so glad!

52
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,610
DON'T DO ANYTHING

53
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,950
I don't know who gave me this paper.

54
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,410
Did he or she mean Luffy and the
others can escape on their own?!

55
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,880
How did they break out of that cage?

56
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,230
Who gave me this?

57
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,490
Who cares about those things now?

58
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,300
I'm a doctor!

59
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,340
I have to save those children!

60
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,150
I found out the formula of the
drug and I got the sedatives!

61
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,550
Wait for me, kids!

62
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,030
I will heal you at any cost!

63
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,670
But come to think of it,
which way should I go?!

64
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,810
What are my soldiers doing?

65
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,130
Troops have mobilized
against them in A Building!

66
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,340
The main unit is preparing to make a
stand at the post in the back of B Building!

67
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,190
I'm sure what they want is
to escape from the island.

68
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,940
Then, they must be heading for...

69
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,350
...the path going directly
to R Building - Gate 66!

70
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,470
I won't let them do that!

71
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,390
Block off the passage
between Building A and B!

72
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,690
Close the gate there and isolate Building A!

73
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,940
And then, destroy Building A

74
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,700
and let Shinokuni flow in!

75
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,910
What?! But if you do such a thing,
it will also kill our guards...

76
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,010
Just do it!

77
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,620
Don't forget to place a
Surveillance Transponder Snail!

78
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,500
What?! M-Master...

79
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,210
Let's restart this open
experiment for the brokers.

80
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,330
I haven't fully shown them
my scientific mastery yet!

81
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,730
Just go already!

82
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,470
Y-Yes, sir!

83
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,220
Humph! How useless!

84
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,690
And what will you do, Vergo?

85
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,070
Only idiots will fall for such a trap.

86
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,580
You're not the only one who
will lose face if we let

87
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,700
Law and Smoker get away, Caesar.

88
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,660
I can't trust you to handle this.

89
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,710
I will cut everything up!

90
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,600
Oh? That's strange.

91
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,130
I can't find my sword.

92
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,800
You're not a swordsman.

93
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,700
Oh yeah, I'm not a swordsman.

94
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,310
Alright, I'll go strike down those squirts.

95
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,130
Where are you, Caesar?!

96
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,320
LABORATORY BUILDING A

97
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,580
I won't let you pass through here, Straw Hat!

98
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,210
I'm a gatekeeper of B Building
and a former pirate!

99
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,210
People call me "Machete" Run!

100
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,920
In the name of Master Caesar,
the scientist of love!

101
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,850
You don't have animal legs!

102
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,840
I'm not a fan!

103
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,680
What kind of centaur you are?!

104
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,310
Spider...

105
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,680
...desu.

106
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,730
Outta my way!

107
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,870
THE PASSAGE BETWEEN BUILDING A AND B

108
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,750
It's a huge tunnel!

109
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,480
Law! What's this buzzer?

110
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,770
It warns people that a gate
in this building will close.

111
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,200
And that's the only passage to Building B.

112
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,780
What?!

113
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,540
I guess he's trying to keep us out.

114
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,910
You better tell your men to move faster.

115
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,710
I don't know what Trafalgar Law meant

116
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,130
when he said he can only give us two hours

117
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,030
but we won't let you guys
get away, Straw Hats!

118
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,550
You have nowhere to run!

119
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,020
What is this buzzer?

120
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,020
Don't do it!

121
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,620
Don't stand in our way!

122
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,670
Ouch!

123
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,750
It's hot!

124
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,090
It's cold!

125
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,360
So dependable!
You three swordsmen!

126
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,510
Alright, let's go!

127
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,260
Th-They're coming!

128
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,700
I think we can make it to the
children pretty easily like this.

129
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,150
Thank you for carrying us, Brownbeard.

130
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,610
Don't mention it. But, guys,

131
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,100
why did you bring the dragon with you?

132
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,870
Well...

133
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,580
We thought that we could get away
from the gas by flying on him

134
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,380
but he didn't fly at all.

135
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,210
He doesn't fly now because
he got injected with sedatives.

136
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:31,180
But it wasn't a great idea
to let him in the laboratory.

137
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,630
Is he dangerous?

138
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,600
He's kind of cute...

139
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
This is a rare opportunity for us!

140
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,920
Take them down!

141
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,940
I'll take the credit!

142
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,690
Didn't I say "Don't do it"?!

143
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,020
C-Captain-chan?!

144
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,190
Wow, you became a Captain, Copy-cat?

145
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,240
But you have no fighting spirit.

146
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,370
That's right. Just go ahead.

147
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,330
Oh, yes, yes!

148
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,780
Thank you so much!

149
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,590
Wait!

150
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,900
G-5! This is no time for fight!

151
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,930
Go to the passage at the back now!

152
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,140
What?!

153
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,180
The only gate in this
building is now closing.

154
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,580
Caesar is trying to fence us in.

155
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,950
If we can't make it to the
other side of the gate,

156
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,370
we can't escape from Punk Hazard!

157
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,110
Just go!

158
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,360
What?!

159
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,740
Oh no!

160
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,330
Hurry up, you guys!

161
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,390
Do as Tashigi-chan says!

162
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,120
Carry the injured!

163
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,380
Hurry up!

164
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,730
Go straight to the gate!

165
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,980
How awful!

166
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,480
Robin, where were you?

167
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,660
Robin-chan!

168
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,280
Luffy asked me to do something.

169
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,370
Anyway, did you hear what the Navy girl said?

170
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,560
Come on, Brownbeard-cchi!

171
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,320
Go faster!

172
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,710
That's impossible.

173
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,430
This is the fastest I can run.

174
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm sick of running!

175
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,990
No!

176
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,720
No!

177
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm not a samurai so I'll just say it!

178
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Enough already!

179
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,220
Hey, why is Brownbeard with those pirates?!

180
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,920
That bastard!

181
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,770
Is he betraying the Master?!

182
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,910
The Master is our great savior!

183
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,120
Let's just run for now!

184
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,760
We're in danger, too!

185
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,540
Come on, G-5!

186
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,660
The gate is right there!

187
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,290
Hurry up!

188
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,680
It's really gonna close soon!

189
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,750
Come on, come on!

190
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,070
Experiment cannon, stand by!

191
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,310
OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY

192
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,180
Take aim at the outer wall of
Building A of the Third Laboratory!

193
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,290
Fire!

194
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,680
The wall's been broken!

195
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,900
H-Hey, don't tell me...

196
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,520
You've got to be kidding!

197
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,290
Run! Run!

198
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,420
No!

199
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,660
What is it?

200
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,390
Shut up!

201
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,800
Brownbeard-cchi! Faster, faster!

202
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,870
Help those fools escape.

203
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,820
The children, too.

204
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,930
Don't look back and keep running!

205
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,200
I'll handle it!

206
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,500
Tashigi-chan!

207
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,580
Oh, help...

208
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,380
Come on!

209
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,730
Get inside the gate!

210
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,030
If you can't make it, you're gonna die!

211
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,280
Faster! Faster! Faster!

212
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,540
Hang on tight!

213
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,010
Yes, we made it!

214
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,400
We did!

215
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,430
Barely!

216
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,770
Hey, where's Tashigi-chan?!

217
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,910
Tashigi-chan told us to go head!

218
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,820
What?!

219
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,950
Don't stop and go straight through the gate!

220
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,700
Come on! Hurry!

221
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,490
Hurry!

222
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,160
What're you doing?!

223
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,740
Hurry up!

224
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,790
Get me down!

225
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,380
Tashigi-chan! That's enough!

226
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,420
You have to survive!

227
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,500
Goodbye!

228
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,170
What?! Captain-chan flew in!

229
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,220
What's going on?!

230
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,850
I'm glad!

231
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,680
But why were you flying...

232
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,820
Move out of my way!

233
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,360
There are still many Navy soldiers outside!

234
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
No! It's filled with gas out there!

235
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,250
Move!

236
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:40,680
I said "No"!

237
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,210
The gate is gonna...

238
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,030
Let go of me! There are still...

239
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,660
There are...

240
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,030
--But the gate is already...
--There are... Let go of me!

241
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,780
Smoker-san told me...

242
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,160
...to help them!

243
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,280
So, move out of my way!

244
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,570
--No, Captain-chan, it's too late!
--There's... There's no time!

245
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,600
Don't be ridiculous!

246
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,590
Your colleagues
are still outside of the gate!

247
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,840
Outta my way!

248
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,470
No means no! Captain Tashigi!

249
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,470
Well done, guys!

250
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,520
We certainly got our beloved
Captain-chan in our hands!

251
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,700
Those scum!

252
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,610
I can't believe that many of them survived.

253
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,910
But I won't let anyone...

254
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,450
...get away!

255
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,310
Despite successfully getting through the gate,

256
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,130
the Navy G-5 are attacked by Vergo.

257
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,820
When Tashigi is in tears as she
witnesses her trusted superior

258
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,060
take down her comrades one after another,

259
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,220
a certain man from the Straw Hats appears!

260
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,220
On the next episode of One Piece!

261
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,070
"The Treacherous Vice Admiral!
Demon Bamboo Vergo!"

262
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,180
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
