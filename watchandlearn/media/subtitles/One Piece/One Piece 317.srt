00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,950
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,760
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,260
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,430
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,430
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,430
Where did the 100 million
Berries we had in here go?

35
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,220
Oh, that. I gave it to them to buy meat
and booze and stuff for the party.

36
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,110
Gave it to them?

37
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,330
Well...

38
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,450
...we got a good deal with the ship,
so there's no problem, right?

39
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,410
Oh, Nami! I'm gonna go out and have fun,
so give me some spending money.

40
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,240
@#$%&!!

41
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,290
You're not getting anything!

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,350
"A Girl in Search of Her Yagara!
Great Search in the City of Water!"

43
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,600
What is it?

44
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,860
What is it, Aobire?

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,460
Was it a dream?

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,620
How nice of you, Chopper. Thanks for
treating me to this water-water candy.

47
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,480
No problem! After all,
she did give me 10,000 Berries.

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,300
I'll use the rest of the money
to buy medical books.

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,660
Oh, yeah?

50
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,460
Hm?

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,250
Isn't that Straw Hat?

52
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,380
You're right!

53
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,130
Hey, everyone! Our town's hero's here!

54
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,820
--Whoa!
--Yo! Party King!

55
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,800
We had fun yesterday!

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,390
--Thank you!
--Let's do it again!

57
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah! Leave it to me!

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,180
After Nami just got done scolding you...

59
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,360
"Missing Yagara"

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,180
This'll do.

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,150
Anyway, the way you ate
was really something else.

62
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,490
I was really admiring, Party King!

63
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,300
Why don't we pick up where we
left off yesterday at my place today?

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,830
What? Are you sure?

65
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,870
--If that's the case, come to my place!
--That's...

66
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,980
--He's coming to my place first!
--If I remember correctly,

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,710
--No, my place!
--My place!
--he's the pirate who saved Iceberg-san...

68
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,940
My place!

69
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,340
--My place!
--My place!
--If it's him, maybe...!

70
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,090
Abi! You left without having breakfast again!

71
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,310
Maybe you should give up on finding Aobire!

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,020
Abi...

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,100
This time, I'll have him eat at my place!

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,930
No! We'll have a party at my place first!

75
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,910
--No! He'll come to my place!
--Your place is tiny!

76
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,190
Straw Hat!

77
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,950
Hm?

78
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,000
I have a favor to ask!

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,740
My family's Yagara went missing!

80
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,710
Help me find him... I mean, please!

81
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,800
Hm?

82
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,920
Hey, that's Abi, the photographer's daughter.

83
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,480
So she's still looking for him?

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,250
It's been three days since the Aqua Laguna.

85
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,180
I feel bad, but he's probably gone.

86
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,850
Yeah.

87
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,660
He was already over 100 years old.
That big wave was too...

88
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,560
Don't lump him with the
stupid Yagara you have!

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,860
That big wave wouldn't be
enough to take out our Aobire!

90
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,160
--What'd you say?!
--Now, now... Calm down, Abi.

91
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,520
As you say, he might have
survived the Aqua Laguna,

92
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,710
but he hasn't been back for
three days now, so he, um...

93
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,090
Yeah, he's right. You shouldn't
drag Straw Hat into it.

94
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,540
You're from Water Seven,
too, so you should know

95
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,700
the story about Yagaras seeking out
their "final nesting village"...

96
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,930
Ahhh! Shut up! Shut up!

97
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,550
No one has seen that place,
so I'm not gonna believe it!

98
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,980
Aobire appeared in my dream!

99
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,350
He asked me to help him!

100
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,820
Say, Straw Hat! You pirates
love treasure, right?!

101
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,970
Here!

102
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,820
This is all the money I have!
If you find him, I'll give it all to you!

103
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,420
Oh? You'll give it to me?

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,090
That's if you find him!

105
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,110
You shouldn't bother, Straw Hat.

106
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,880
If you, by any chance, come to step
into their final nesting village...

107
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,910
You, shut up!

108
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,340
Scary!

109
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,580
I don't quite get it, but it is true
that pirates can't just pass up

110
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,180
treasure that's right in front of them.

111
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,890
That treasure of yours...

112
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,230
I'll make it all mine.

113
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,520
Really?

114
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,190
Yeah.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,540
It's a deal.

116
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,030
I'm Abi! Nice to meet you!

117
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,740
I'm Luffy.

118
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,750
This is Chopper, our ship's doctor.

119
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,500
N-Nice to meet you.

120
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,910
Th-The little raccoon dog spoke!

121
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,290
Who're you calling a little raccoon dog?!

122
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,540
So... what am I supposed to find again?

123
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,680
Whoa...

124
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,670
Weren't you listening?!
Aobire! My family's Yagara!

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,970
Look!

126
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,090
You'll know it's him by the blue fin on his head.

127
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,760
His fin is blue, so his name is Aobire, huh?
I like it. It's easy to understand.

128
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,580
All right, then! Leave it to me!

129
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,940
Go! Go!

130
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,940
And why are we starting our search here?!

131
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,700
Why not? This is the best place to
look out over the city, don't you think?

132
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,520
I-I'm scared!

133
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Go back to town already!

134
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,940
Well, hold on.

135
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,420
Oh?

136
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,170
That's Zoro.

137
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,850
Hey, Zoro! I'm here!
I'm right here! Can't you hear me?!

138
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,050
Hey, it's shaking!

139
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,010
There's no way he can hear you!

140
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,340
We're gonna fall!

141
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Huh?

142
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,290
That was dangerous!

143
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,270
You are dangerous!

144
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,950
Get your act together!

145
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,540
How about this one, Robin?

146
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,250
That's nice! It looks good on you.

147
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,290
Oh?

148
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,850
--Hey! Nami! Robin!
--Not again!

149
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,420
--Hey!
--Oh...

150
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,380
Oh, that's right. If we ask Robin...

151
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,880
A Yagara with a blue fin on his head, huh?

152
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,510
Okay. I'll try.

153
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,830
Ojos Fleur!

154
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,830
Robin, did you find him?

155
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,990
I'm sorry, but I can't find him.

156
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,990
I see. Thanks anyway.

157
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,250
Let's go, Abi.

158
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,700
Abi!

159
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,370
Later, Robin.

160
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,300
Okay.

161
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,050
I was really shocked!

162
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,770
Thanks to Robin, we now know that
he isn't on the shipbuilding island.

163
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,800
The good news is that it saved us some time.

164
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,010
Say, Abi. Can I ask you a question?

165
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,950
What is it?

166
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,690
What is the final nesting village that
the townspeople were talking about?

167
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,400
It is said that when Yagaras realize
their lives are about to end,

168
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,420
they leave their groups or their owners
and go to a certain place to die.

169
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,490
That's the final nesting village.

170
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,760
I see...

171
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,950
--But...
--But?

172
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,830
...if humans see this final nesting village...

173
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,710
If they see it...?

174
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,040
...they'll also be taken to the netherworld!

175
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,450
Nooo!

176
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,510
It's just a superstition!
There's no need to worry!

177
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:23,390
Oh, hey, captain! Do you need
a sniper for your pirate group?

178
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,600
This humble, flattering plan isn't that good.

179
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,100
Is there something else...?

180
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,580
Whoa! I got a bite!

181
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,820
Oof! I'm not gonna let you escape!

182
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,280
I give up.

183
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,510
Aobire! Where are you?!

184
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,590
He isn't around here.

185
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,330
Let's go check the backstreets, shall we?

186
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,240
Okay.

187
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,000
I thought I was a goner.

188
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,650
Hey, Luffy!

189
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,720
I found someone who heard Aobire's voice!

190
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,930
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

191
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,710
So on the night of the Aqua Laguna,
you heard someone around here say,

192
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,990
"I'm coming to rescue you, so hang in there"?

193
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,490
He says it was definitely
Grandpa Aobire's voice.

194
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,780
--Abi!
--Yeah! Thank you, little guy!

195
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,650
It's incredible that you
understand the Yagara's language!

196
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,990
Oh, stop it! I'm not a "little guy," you jerk!

197
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,370
Now that we know that, let's thoroughly
search this area, shall we?!

198
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,750
Yeah!

199
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,900
Go!

200
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,700
Hey, you're gonna fall.

201
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,810
It tickles!

202
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,770
I'm looking all over for him, and yet, why...

203
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,120
How is it? Is it warm?

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,330
Whoa! Watch out! Not that direction, Aobire!

205
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,920
Dad, is it true that Aobire can't see?

206
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,340
Yeah, he's an old Yagara who
turned 100 a long time ago.

207
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,600
I was told that there's no chance
that his sight will come back.

208
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,720
Oh, no...

209
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,600
Aobire has been serving our
family very well for generations.

210
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,350
But we can no longer deny
the decline in his strength.

211
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,230
We should start preparing ourselves...

212
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,690
But... I don't know how
best to explain it to Abi.

213
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,910
No! Aobire's coming, too!

214
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,170
We can't take him to the evacuation facility.

215
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,890
We do this every year. You should know that.

216
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,420
No, no!

217
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,690
What?!

218
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,230
Our house is in the center of the city.

219
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,350
There's no way he'll be swallowed
by the Aqua Laguna, Abi.

220
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,140
Aobire...

221
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,880
Aobire!

222
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,900
I wonder if he really was
swallowed by the Aqua Laguna...

223
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,990
Or...

224
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,140
No fish would drown.

225
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,240
He asked you to help him, right?

226
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,090
Then you shouldn't give up!

227
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,010
He's right, Abi.

228
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,340
You can cry later.

229
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,970
I'm not crying!

230
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,930
Ah, I see.

231
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,180
All right, then! We know the
area we should be searching.

232
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,280
Let's check it one more time.

233
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,900
Hm?

234
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,480
What's this?

235
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,520
Ah!

236
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,160
This is Aobire's...!

237
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,630
Did it come from there?

238
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,910
That's an entrance to the
underground waterways!

239
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,340
This is the place!

240
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,970
--Hey! Aobire!
--Say something!

241
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,830
--Where are you?!
--Aobire!
--Aobire!

242
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,630
--Hey!
--Aobire!

243
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,910
--Hey!
--Hey!

244
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,550
What's wrong?

245
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,840
H-Hm?

246
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,420
The water is...

247
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,290
We can't go any farther on the Yagara like this.

248
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,850
There's no water ahead of here.

249
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,200
In any case, let's try moving ahead.

250
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,150
Yeah.

251
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,430
You stay here and wait for us, okay?

252
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,620
See you later.

253
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,010
What's this? There's a town
underneath the town.

254
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,640
What's going on?

255
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,700
My dad told me once that they built
new buildings above the old ones

256
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,710
and kept doing that.

257
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,970
I see...

258
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,840
Hm? What's that light?

259
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,430
H-Hey! Abi!

260
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,390
I'm sure he's there!

261
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,150
I'll see him soon!

262
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll see Aobire!

263
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,500
What's this?!

264
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,650
I-I can't breathe!

265
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,930
Help...! Help!

266
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,970
Aobire!

267
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,250
I'm alive...

268
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,330
Luffy! Little guy! Are you guys okay?!

269
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,740
Good!

270
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,630
Wh-What's this place?

271
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,470
What's the matter, Abi?

272
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,460
Luffy... Aobire is here.

273
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,620
This is the same place that I saw in my dream!

274
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,120
Don't tell me... this is the final nesting village?!

275
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,450
That can't be right! The final
nesting village is a superstition!

276
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,790
Don't talk like Aobire is dead!

277
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,970
That's just a story created to
explain mysteries about the Yagaras!

278
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,910
What?

279
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,060
Good! So you were there!

280
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,530
Aobire! Come here! Let's go home together!

281
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,880
Chopper!

282
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,740
He says, "I'm sorry, Abi."

283
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,810
Why are you apologizing?!
I wanted to see you all this time!

284
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,280
We're not mad about
your sudden disappearance.

285
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,490
Forget that! Let's go home together!

286
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,490
What?

287
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,030
What's he saying?

288
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,660
Er... Yeah...

289
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,010
He says he can't do that.

290
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,390
Why?!

291
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,700
"Now I can feel at ease."

292
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,070
"Thanks for everything."

293
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,740
No! Don't go!

294
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,590
Aobire!

295
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,510
No! Aobire!

296
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,680
We were always together!

297
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,060
I'm coming with you to the final nesting village!

298
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,650
Let go of me!

299
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,780
Aobire!

300
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,510
What is this?!

301
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,620
--What's that?
--A Yagara's voice...?

302
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,720
His heartbeat is weak...

303
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,150
...but I think he'll be able to pull through.

304
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,070
Looks like the scarf kept him
warm and helped him survive!

305
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,350
Th-That's the scarf that I gave to Aobire...

306
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,940
"I'll rescue you now, so hang in there!"

307
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,450
So Aobire tried to save him...!

308
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,820
That's why he appeared in my dream...

309
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,420
Here!

310
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,190
That's okay. I couldn't keep my promise, so...

311
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,810
No...

312
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,860
Thank you, Luffy.

313
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,690
Thanks to you two,
I was able to see Aobire again.

314
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,590
I was very glad!

315
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,330
Also...

316
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,270
...I was able to grant his last wish...

317
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,790
I was able to save this baby Yagara, so...

318
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
I see.

319
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,260
Yep.

320
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,190
Then...

321
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,440
He'll need lots of food in
order to get strong, so...

322
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,110
Thank you.

323
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,670
Say, do you think that place
was the final nesting village?

324
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,870
Well, it doesn't really matter.

325
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,950
After all, the world is full of mysteries
that we know nothing about!

326
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,760
Okay, then, everyone!
We're gonna go shopping!

327
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,690
Listen. I have nothing to do
with you guys! Why do I...

328
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,760
Well then, carry the younger ones on your back.

329
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,630
Sure, I can carry two babies on my back...
Hey, that's not the point!

330
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,430
Are you listening to me?! Hey!

331
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,620
On the next episode of One Piece!

332
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,610
"Mothers Are Strong!
Zoro's Hectic Household Chores!"

333
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
