2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,340
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,900
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,870
Now's the time to set
sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,340
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,360
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,620
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,330
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,620
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,800
One Piece

23
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,730
Luffy accepted the Foxy Pirates' dare
and agreed to Davy Back rules.

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,780
However, his team lost the first-round
Donut Race, due to Foxy's trickery.

25
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,410
The first person I want is... you!

26
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,290
The ship doctor! Tony Tony Chopper!

27
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,130
All right! Do anything you like with me!

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,220
The team must now win the
second-round Groggy Ring

29
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,390
to get Chopper back, but...

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,030
--Seem like a good match?
--Yep.

31
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,230
"Round 2! Shoot It into the Groggy Ring"

32
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,480
Our mighty Groggy Ring
combatants have taken the field!

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,780
Opposing them...

34
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,280
...is the violent cook who kicked
the interference squads'

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,700
butt in Round #1: Sanji!

36
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,620
That's "first-rate cook."

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,000
And the pirate hunter with a bounty
of 60 million: Roronoa Zoro!

38
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,240
This is what they called us
out here for? What a laugh!

39
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,470
Right, Big Pan?

40
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,010
Huh?

41
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,890
He can't hear ya.

42
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,670
What's with these guys?

43
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,830
We'll start with a coin toss.

44
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,940
Tails.

45
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,150
--What do you choose?
--Heads, obviously!

46
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,360
Tails.

47
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,000
Field or ball?

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
Ball.

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,410
Our Groggy Monsters have chosen the ball!

50
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,810
The Straw Hat ball man will
enter the other team's mid-circle!

51
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,540
--Which side do you want?
--Doesn't matter.

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,220
During the game, there are two
"ball men" with a ball on their heads!

53
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,510
Knock your opponent's ball man into
your opponent's ring and you win!

54
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,160
Just get on with it!

55
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,600
Get in position, ball man!

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,730
Hey, now.

57
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,300
I don't care how pushy you are,

58
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,280
I still ain't gonna be the damn ball.

59
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,280
I refuse to wear this stupid thing!

60
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,170
Quit your whining!

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,030
--Oh! Looks good on you!
--I won't fall for that, moron!

62
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,040
Zoro! Sanji! It's up to you guys!

63
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,870
Win Chopper back! We can't lose now!

64
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm really sorry! We're counting you!

65
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,550
Whoa, a wotan... I've never seen one before!

66
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,970
I guess they're not as large
as pureblooded giants.

67
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,010
Cheer them on all you
want; it's still no use!

68
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,820
Everyone on our team is a Groggy Ring expert!

69
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,240
What do you want, Split-Head?

70
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,470
He said it again...

71
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,320
Oh, Boss!

72
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,070
Now quit doing that, Straw Hat!

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,850
I doubt I'll need to
interfere with this game,

74
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,810
so I thought I'd watch too.

75
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,410
Got a problem with that?

76
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,620
Interference is allowed with this game too?!

77
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,530
Imbecile! It's allowed for every game!

78
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,010
It's just, some people will stoop
to anything to help their team win,

79
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,210
while others might insist on a
fair-and-square contest, you know?

80
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,270
So it depends on the situation.

81
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,280
But if you can't even
handle a little interference,

82
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,060
how can you hope to survive
as a seafaring pirate?

83
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,400
It's a question of character.

84
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,320
That's how you justify it?

85
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,280
What's with that team of yours, anyway?!

86
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,580
If you can even call it a team!

87
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,950
Talk all you want! Once the match starts,
you'll see what they can--!

88
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,380
You went too early just now!

89
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,630
Did not! I win!

90
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,250
At everything.

91
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,450
Don't be a smartass!

92
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,980
We're talking about rock-paper-scissors here!

93
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,300
No, you lost!

94
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,720
Just decide on a ball man already!

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,260
They haven't even agreed on that yet...

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,650
Sanji-kun! That ball looks nice on you!

97
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,910
I'll do it! I'm the ball
man! I'm the worthiest!

98
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,950
It does suit you. You look like a prince.

99
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,450
Of Moronica.

100
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,370
Just start the game!

101
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,430
Hold on! Weapons are against
the rules! Lose the swords!

102
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,960
Huh? Really?

103
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
Yes, this is a ball game!

104
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,430
It wouldn't be much of a game
if weapons were allowed!

105
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,810
I'm fine either way, to be honest!

106
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,940
Hey, you gonna be okay?

107
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,400
A master swordsman without swords is...

108
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,360
Is what?

109
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,990
...nothing but a worthless wimp.

110
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,540
Knock it off, you guys!

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,750
All right! It's now or never!

112
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,880
The Straw Hats' ball man, Sanji,
has entered the opponent's circle!

113
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,750
--Hey, cook. Hope you get trampled.
--Shut up!

114
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,490
Stomp 'im, Big Pan!

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,220
The crowd is all fired up!

116
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Big Pan! Let's run-and-gun 'em!

117
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,940
Huh?

118
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,520
He can't hear ya!

119
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,810
U-Uhh...

120
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,120
C'mon, man...

121
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,760
Pay attention!

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,080
It's not that funny, is it?

123
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,920
The Groggy Monsters are as jolly as always!

124
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,090
Let's get this delightful show on the road!

125
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,380
There's no time limit,
and the first team to score wins!

126
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,350
So we win if we knock Jumbo's
head into the other ring...

127
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,180
And we lose if the cook's head
gets knocked into our ring...

128
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,860
Can Team Straw Hat win back
the reindeer they lost in Round 1?!

129
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,240
Crush 'em!

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,540
Or will Team Foxy swipe
another crew member?!

131
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,180
They're about to clash in Groggy Ring!

132
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,460
The whistle is about to sound!

133
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,510
Let the game begin!

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,260
What will ball man Sanji
do in enemy territory?!

135
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,200
Will he retreat or attack?!

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,020
Let's do it!

137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,940
There goes "Tackle Machine" Pickles!

138
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,230
All right. I'll take care of this myself.

139
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,570
Sling Tackle!

140
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,400
I don't care about you!

141
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm only after you!

142
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,740
All we gotta do to win is beat you down!

143
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,870
It's a ball man battle!

144
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,580
Collier...!

145
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,460
Wh-What the...?! His skin's all slimy!

146
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,510
Sanji the cook slips and slides
on Big Pan's outstretched arm!

147
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,260
It's only natural, though...

148
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,310
...for Big Pan is a slippery-skinned
wotan of loach origin!

149
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,190
What the heck are you doing?!

150
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,650
Run-and-gun!

151
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,360
You idiot!

152
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,360
Who are you calling an idiot?!

153
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,570
Punk Pass!

154
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,290
There it is! Big Pan's super-long pass!

155
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,960
Sanji!

156
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,670
Their leader, Hamburg,
makes for the landing point!

157
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,380
With Roronoa Zoro racing by his side!

158
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,760
I'll chop you up if they score a goal!

159
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,740
Shut up! Quit your whining!

160
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,890
Sweeping Tackle!

161
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,770
Pickles enters enemy territory!

162
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,060
Meanwhile, can Hamburg
catch Sanji in the air?!

163
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,480
Yes! And then...!

164
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,360
Gorilla Throw!

165
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,070
I got it! I got it!

166
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,060
Waiting for him now is Pickles!

167
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,120
Get back here! I'll teach you to...!

168
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,660
Roronoa moves to intercept, but...!

169
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,250
Spinning Tackle!

170
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,460
What?!

171
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,920
Ball man Sanji is sent flying skyward, too!

172
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,630
Sanji!

173
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,800
Bringing up the rear is Big Pan!

174
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
He rushes for the falling Hamburg!

175
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,640
Punk Receive!

176
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,650
Hamburg catches Sanji above
enemy territory! Incredible!

177
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,650
They're within range of the ring!

178
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,650
Stupid Eyebrows!

179
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,660
Here it comes! The Hamburger Dunk!

180
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,750
Wh-What are you--?!

181
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,170
Zoro! Sanji! Do something!

182
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,460
Is it about to end already?!

183
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,010
Don't need to tell me...!

184
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,600
I ain't gonna... let 'em score!

185
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,830
You ain't gonna score!

186
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,030
I'm still in tip-top shape!

187
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,490
I can't let that damn swordsman snub me...

188
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,950
...by saving...

189
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,450
...my hide!

190
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,460
No goal!

191
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,600
No goal!

192
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,480
It looks like ball man Sanji isn't going
to pass through the goal so easily!

193
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,840
Mind your own damn business!

194
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,490
You get thrown around too easy, idiot!

195
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,160
A duo as powerful as the
Groggy Monsters has appeared!

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,960
We have an epic game on our hands!

197
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,460
This has never happened before!
This is unprecedented!

198
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,920
These behemoths were sent
flying through the air!

199
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,370
The crowd is stunned!
Team Straw Hat is formidable!

200
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,140
I don't need you to give me backup!

201
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,270
It's only 'cause I can't count on you!

202
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,770
--They're amazing!
--They actually threw Pickles!

203
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,690
They sent Hamburg-san flying!

204
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,540
--Who asked for your help?!
--You get tossed around too much!

205
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,670
Oh, no! What are you doing, Hamburg?!

206
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,670
Lose and you'll regret it!

207
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,090
Are you an idiot, Pervert Cook?!

208
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,920
I do things my way, Twirly Eyebrows!

209
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,720
You're nothing--

210
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,800
Just shut up and do what I say!

211
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,890
You're a real idiot for someone so green!

212
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,310
Oh, but Team Straw Hat is acting strangely!

213
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,830
Although the game is still going
with both ball men in bounds,

214
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,360
the two teammates are
arguing instead of playing!

215
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,610
They're funny!

216
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,910
Zoro! Sanji! You idiots!

217
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,530
What are you doing?! Now's your chance!

218
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,200
The other ball man's all alone!

219
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,860
Gang up on him and knock him into the ring!

220
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,570
Huh?

221
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,290
Big Pan goes in for a surprise attack!

222
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,500
Whoa...!

223
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,490
Too Bad Dance!

224
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,930
What are you running for?! He's the ball man!

225
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,890
Yeah, we know! But hang on,
he has blades under his shoes!

226
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,230
Hey, Ref!

227
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,460
What happened to "no weapons allowed"?!

228
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,310
Whoa! Can you be any more blatant?!

229
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,940
If he misses a play, it's out of his hands!

230
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,750
Quit screwing around, Ref!

231
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
Hold on, Sanji-kun!

232
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,850
You saw the whole thing!
Why are you sweatin' like a waterfall?!

233
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,020
I-I didn't s-see a th-thing...

234
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,310
Liar!

235
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,560
Hey, hold on! He's the ref, you know!

236
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,150
Yellow card to Sanji of Team Straw Hat!

237
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,860
Say what?!

238
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,150
W-Wait! Wait! Wait!

239
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,370
And there's the yellow warning card!

240
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,580
One more and Sanji the cook
will get a red ejection card!

241
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,750
I'll eject you!

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,920
I can't believe he's scummy
enough to attack the referee!

243
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,670
Shut up! I oughta knock you off!

244
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,210
He's a gangster!

245
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,680
We gotta do something about his weapons...

246
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,850
Hold on! You're allowing that now?!

247
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,850
--I just happen to be looking away...

248
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,540
--Look out there, Ref!

249
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,460
That idiot's using an axe now! An axe!

250
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,560
No! Stop! You can't afford to get ejected!

251
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,120
Are you kidding me?! I can't let
'em get away with this insanity!

252
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,870
Don't you see?! They want you to get mad!

253
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,690
--Just let it go!
--I won't!

254
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,830
Pull yourself together!
This is for Chopper's sake!

255
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,080
All right! Then I'll beat him up!

256
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,040
Don't go complicating things!

257
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,340
Sanji-kun! Just beat 'em!

258
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,760
"Pose of Love"

259
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,300
You got it!

260
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,300
You don't make any sense...

261
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,350
All right! Back to the game!

262
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,850
You didn't have to start with that again!

263
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,230
This is gettin' us nowhere!

264
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,070
But we can change our game plan
now that we know they've got weapons!

265
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,740
It's time to take him out!

266
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,610
Stay out of my way! I can handle him myself!

267
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,580
Work together! You're a team, you know!

268
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,160
And there they go!
All three are about to collide!

269
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,800
Can't attack where his skin
is exposed! He's too slippery!

270
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,470
That leaves his hands,
feet, mask, and trunks...

271
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,930
Loach Scooping Slide!

272
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,810
Crap!

273
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,270
Loach Racing Circus!

274
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,400
There it is! The Racing Circus acrobatics!

275
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,830
Both opponents slide across his wide back!

276
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,110
Ha! Won't work this time!
I can handle a little skating!

277
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,230
Now they can't escape!

278
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,070
--So dizzy...!
--Come on, you guys!

279
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,660
Meanwhile, the other two players
have gotten back into the game!

280
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,120
--Oh! They're back in it!
--Slaughter 'em!

281
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh? Their attire is a little different now!

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,260
Hamburg, their leader, is wearing
iron knuckles and iron elbow guards!

283
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,890
Meanwhile, Pickles has donned
spiked shoulder protectors!

284
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,560
These clearly violate the "no weapons" rule!

285
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,030
Oh, but the referee just happens
to have his back turned right now

286
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,970
as he does some stretches!

287
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,570
Now I'm mad, Leader!

288
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,650
Here goes!

289
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,960
Loach Coaster!

290
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,330
Everything's spinning...!

291
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,750
Let's do it, Leader!

292
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,910
Yeah!

293
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,500
Spinning Tackle!

294
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,500
The recovered players counterattack!

295
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,460
But their target isn't the ball man--
it's the swordsman Roronoa!

296
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,130
They're sniping him with the iron knuckles!

297
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,220
Hamburger Hammer!

298
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,850
Zoro!

299
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,600
The attack isn't over yet! Big Pan
instantly takes an attack stance!

300
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,400
Hamburg prepares to use
his iron elbow guards!

301
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,210
--No way!
--It can't be...

302
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,360
This is truly dangerous! A horrifying combo!

303
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,950
He's almost like...

304
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,540
...an arrow!

305
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,130
Punk Attack!

306
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,640
Zoro!

307
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,520
It connects! Direct hit!

308
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,910
Note that deaths in Groggy Ring are
to be expected and are of no concern.

309
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,610
So... dizzy...

310
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,320
Team Foxy isn't ready to stop its attack yet!

311
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,030
Human...

312
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,360
Cannon!

313
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,020
Ugh... I feel sick...

314
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,280
The spiked shoulder protector draws near!

315
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,890
Sanji! Get out of the way!

316
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,950
Sling Tackle!

317
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,750
They're setting up Sanji the ball man now!

318
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,340
Size Attack: S!

319
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,340
Hamburg sends him flying back!
They're not preparing to score at all!

320
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:04,970
M!

321
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,680
L!

322
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,330
The Groggy Monsters unleash
a spectacular team attack!

323
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,990
Just terrible...

324
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,950
Zoro!

325
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,800
Sanji!

326
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,330
Looks like Team Straw Hat
isn't getting up from this!

327
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,670
Piece o' cake!

328
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,510
The opponents literally are "groggy"!

329
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,050
All that remains now is to stuff
the ball man into his ring coffin

330
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,100
and this will be two wins in a row!

331
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,970
The undefeated Groggy Monsters
are supremely powerful!

332
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,560
We win again!

333
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,550
Hey, cook...

334
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,540
Lend me a hand for ten seconds...

335
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,050
Sounds like... a reasonable length of time...

336
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,230
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

337
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,780
Chasing after something constant

338
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,410
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

339
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,660
Even when we're exhausted

340
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,830
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

341
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,250
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

342
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,170
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

343
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

344
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,930
We pray to this endless
sky that we look up at

345
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,020
Eternally... Eternally...

346
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,810
Wild fantasies from our childhood

347
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,650
We trace unforgettable memories

348
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,320
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

349
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

350
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,950
Together we entrust our feelings

351
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,540
We go beyond the changing time

352
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,330
Eternally... Eternally...

353
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,460
Hold on! They're clearly using weapons now!

354
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,180
--Hey, Prince Moron!
--Come on, you wimpy swordsman!

355
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,020
--Ugh, I can't stand them!
--Forget it. This is the way men are.

356
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,270
They're funny!

357
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,270
Come on! This is for Chopper!
Pull yourselves together!

358
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,230
"A Barrage of Red Cards in Groggy Ring!"

360
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
