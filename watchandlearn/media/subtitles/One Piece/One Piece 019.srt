00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,550
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,610
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,770
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,390
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,910
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,520
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,280
Whew, that's heavy!

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,850
W-What is that?!

26
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,950
I found it in the storeroom!

27
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,990
Those're cannonballs!

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,960
We finally got a cannon,
so I thought I'd do some practice!

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,750
Then just leave it to me!

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,150
I believe it was when I was three
that I jumped on a cannonball

31
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,220
flying my way and traveled
halfway around the world!

32
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,790
--How do you work this thing?
--Listen!

33
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,260
Hey, Zoro! Do you
know how to work it?!

34
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,390
He's been fast asleep all this time.

35
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,180
He's no fun.

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,590
A little further to the south is a
reef that'd make a perfect target!

37
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,440
For reals?!

38
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Let's go! Let's go!

39
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,730
--Let's go there!
--Hey! You're gonna fire
a cannon without me?!

40
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,450
People used to call me Cannon
Master Usopp, you know!

41
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,940
Listen!

42
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,850
"The Three-Sword Style's Past!
Zoro and Kuina's Vow!"

43
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,730
Hey!

44
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,710
Hey!

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
I'm here to challenge your dojo!

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,800
Someone strong, come out! Fight me!

47
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,570
Dojo-challenging is
certainly rare these days.

48
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,090
Hmph! Don't take me
lightly just 'cause I'm a kid!

49
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,890
I'm unrivaled in the next village over!

50
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,780
Very well. I accept.

51
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,460
If I win, I get your dojo!

52
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,640
And if you lose?

53
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,220
T-Then, uhh...

54
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,020
I'll become a student here!

55
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,120
That will be fine. Now, then...

56
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,450
Kuina!

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,320
Yes, Father?

58
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,200
What?! You're not gonna fight me?!

59
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,470
Kuina is a girl, but she's even
stronger than the adults in the dojo.

60
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,780
I say this, even as her parent...

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,230
Fine!

62
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,240
Then please come inside.

63
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,620
I can use any I want?

64
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,020
To your heart's content.

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,580
All right, then! Let's begin!

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,840
Alright! Bring it on!

67
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,470
Bow before the gods!

68
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,660
What's he doing?

69
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,670
He's ridiculous...

70
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,690
Bow to each other!

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
Begin!

72
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,380
D-Damn it!

73
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,750
You've studied Two-Sword
Style techniques before?

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,720
No! Today's the first time I've
ever held a bamboo sword!

75
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,560
Today's your first time?

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,770
Damn it!

77
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm strong! And I'm
gonna get even stronger!

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,490
I refuse... I refuse to lose to this girl!

79
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,680
Oww...

80
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,760
Why doesn't he dodge?!

81
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,920
Match over!

82
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,660
He's like a boar.

83
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,280
Come now, Kuina!

84
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,370
It's 10 years too early for an
amateur to use the Two-Sword Style!

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,710
What?!

86
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,670
What?

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,510
We can fight another match, if you want!

88
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,790
Damn it! A loss is a loss!

89
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,840
Yes. It's good to accept
defeat gracefully. Then, you'll...

90
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,980
Yeah! I'll become a student here!
Got a problem with that?!

91
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,180
None whatsoever.

92
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,020
I'm going to train lots and lots and lots

93
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,330
and then I will beat you!

94
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,620
Remember that!

95
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,780
That day'll never come.

96
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,890
Match over!

97
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,590
The winner is Kuina,
with 2000 wins and 0 losses!

98
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,340
D-Damn it...

99
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,560
You're still as weak as ever, Zoro!

100
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,320
You're so pathetic. Especially for a boy.

101
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,700
Hey! Zoro isn't weak!

102
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,020
He's the strongest one
out of all the guys!

103
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,300
He's even beat grownups!

104
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,580
But he's weaker than me.

105
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,420
Even with two swords,
a weakling's still a weakling.

106
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,430
You losers'd do good to stay quiet.
Your howling makes you pitiful.

107
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,580
You lost again, Zoro...

108
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,270
Even after you've grown so strong.

109
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,400
Sensei! Are you
giving her secret training

110
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,760
'cause she's your daughter?!

111
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,740
Don't cheat!

112
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,680
No, no. I do no such thing.

113
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,900
Zoro did indeed grow stronger.

114
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,080
But Kuina has grown stronger as well.

115
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,420
Zoro?

116
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,670
Zoro?

117
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,910
I'm gonna wash my face.

118
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,260
Damn it!

119
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,050
Why can't I beat Kuina?! Why?! Why?!

120
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,730
I'm gonna be the
strongest man in the world!

121
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,970
So why?!

122
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,380
Tonight... I'm gonna fight her again!

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,670
A mere year since he became a pupil...

124
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,910
Zoro's improvement is
nothing short of spectacular.

125
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,990
He trains incomparably
more than any of the others.

126
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,880
So I suppose it's only natural.

127
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,840
But... it seems he's still
no match for Kuina-san.

128
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,060
Female swordsmen are
faced with immense walls.

129
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,310
As she is now, I cannot
let her inherit the dojo.

130
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,620
Father!

131
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,910
Kuina-san!

132
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,640
It's not nice to eavesdrop, Kuina.

133
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,600
I will become the world's
greatest swordsman! You'll see!

134
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,420
Kuina. As a girl...

135
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,810
...you can never be
the world's strongest.

136
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,310
Zoro?!

137
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,300
What're you doing out here?

138
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,580
That's my line!

139
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,850
What are you doing here at this hour?!

140
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm here to challenge you
to your 2001st fight!

141
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,870
I plan to make this
my last fight with you!

142
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,790
I'm going to end this!

143
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,400
Fight me with a real sword!

144
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,870
You have a real one, don't you?!

145
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,630
Against me?

146
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,010
Sure.

147
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
The Wado Ichimonji...

148
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,810
Two real swords are heavy, huh?

149
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,600
It seems you still lack strength!

150
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,800
S-Shut up!

151
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,020
My 2001st win.

152
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,430
Damn it...

153
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,650
Damn it...

154
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,670
This sucks...

155
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,120
I'm the one who should be
crying out of frustration.

156
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,070
Eh?

157
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,730
You see, when girls grow up,
they get weaker than men...

158
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,400
Even you'll catch up to me soon...

159
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,450
You're always saying you're going
to be the world's best swordsman.

160
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,450
My father told me that
a girl can never be that...

161
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
I know...

162
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,170
I know that!

163
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,370
But... But it's frustrating!

164
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,570
You're lucky, Zoro. You're a boy.

165
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,390
I want to be the world's
greatest swordsman, too!

166
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,100
My breasts have even
started to grow out now...

167
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,410
If only... If only I had
been born a man...

168
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't be whining like
that after you beat me!

169
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,020
That's not fair! You're my goal!

170
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,490
Zoro...

171
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,330
Boy this, girl that!

172
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,500
Are you gonna say that stuff
too when I beat you someday?!

173
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,300
You act like none of it is skill!

174
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,000
You're insulting all the hard
training I've been doing!

175
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,360
So don't say that stuff!

176
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,350
Promise me!

177
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,860
Someday, one of us will be
the world's greatest swordsman!

178
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,090
We'll compete to see who gets there!

179
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,940
You dummy. You're so weak...

180
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,270
--It's a promise!
--It's a promise!

181
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,450
Whoa...

182
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,790
She's gotten even stronger than before!

183
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,800
Gotta get stronger! So I can
hold lots of swords just fine!

184
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,110
If two's not enough,
then I'll use three!

185
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,490
What do you guys want?

186
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,370
Kuina...

187
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,310
Kuina's dead...

188
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,900
Apparently, she slipped and fell
down the storehouse steps...

189
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,700
Storehouse?

190
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,760
Seems she was looking for a
sharpening stone for her beloved sword.

191
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,500
What would she need that for?

192
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,130
I don't know...

193
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,960
She was just a child, too...

194
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,870
There's just no understanding people...

195
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,770
No one knows what's
just around the corner...

196
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,110
People are such fragile things, Zoro...

197
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,460
Kuina...

198
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,840
She was a very competitive girl...

199
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,920
She practiced in this dojo
since she was little,

200
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,460
and achieved strength
that exceeded even adults.

201
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,800
Because of this,
she became a bit self-conceited...

202
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,360
But then that's when
you appeared, Zoro.

203
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,420
I thank you.

204
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,910
You grew ever stronger, so she
started to practice even more,

205
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,130
so as not to lose to you.

206
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,890
So as not to lose to a boy...

207
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,860
And she had begun to break down
the walls of female swordsmanship...

208
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,890
...but I'm an ordinary parent, too.

209
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,500
When I look at you now,
I feel pained, too...

210
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,780
Sensei...

211
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,890
Let me have... that sword...

212
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,320
Kuina's sword?

213
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,110
I'm going to get stronger for her, too!

214
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,910
I'm going to get strong enough
that my name reaches to Heaven!

215
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,770
I'm going to be the world's
strongest swordsman!

216
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,640
I promised her...

217
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,880
I...

218
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,450
Yes. You can have it.

219
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,730
I leave Kuina's spirit
and dreams... with you.

220
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,320
Eight years since then...

221
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,920
You're finally going to set out, then?

222
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,930
Yes, Sensei.

223
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,840
To fulfill our promise.

224
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,510
Zoro!

225
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,790
Take care.

226
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,890
Huh? That was way off!

227
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,680
What are you guys doing?!

228
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,440
Cannon practice!

229
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,810
But they sure don't fly good!

230
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,870
I'm telling you, let me try!

231
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,830
Judging from the last flying distance...

232
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,320
This should do it.

233
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,610
Fire!

234
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,340
Awesome!

235
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,320
You hit it on your first try!

236
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,960
I really hit it...

237
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,760
Whadya think?! I'm awesome when
it comes to aiming! Impressed?!

238
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,800
Yeah! Yeah!

239
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,220
It's settled! You're our sniper!

240
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,870
What?! I don't get to be captain?!

241
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,340
I'm the captain!

242
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,770
Well, whatever! I'll humor you for now!

243
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,230
But if you do anything too cowardly,
I'm taking over immediately!

244
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,310
Yeah, that's fine.

245
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,280
But anyways, I was thinking, there's
one other position we need to fill

246
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,410
before going into the Grand Line!

247
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,470
Yeah! We have a fancy kitchen, too!

248
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,160
If you pay me, I can do it!

249
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,220
An important necessity
for long trips, right?

250
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,740
Yeah! All pirate ships need one, huh?!

251
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,580
A musician!

252
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,260
Are you an idiot?!

253
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,470
What do you see voyages as?!

254
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,550
Just when it seemed you were
gonna say something smart...

255
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,760
But pirates sing, you know!

256
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,550
Come out, you damn pirates!

257
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,930
What the... What the... Who are you?!

258
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,280
Shut up!

259
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,700
Who I am doesn't amount to crap!

260
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,680
How many are there?

261
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,050
One... I think?

262
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,050
Then leave it to him.

263
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,780
"Sea"

264
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,200
We've taken the heads of many a pirate!

265
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,860
Are you nameless pirate
wannabes trying to kill my partner?!

266
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,540
That voice...

267
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,250
What do you mean, "partner"?!

268
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,780
I dunno what's going on,
but stop breaking our ship!

269
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,520
L-Lost by a hair...

270
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,250
What's going on?

271
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,180
Hey! Is that you, Johnny?!

272
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,560
Who's saying my name all familiar-like?!

273
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,110
B-Big Bro Zoro?!

274
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,700
It is you, Johnny!

275
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,130
What are you doing here, Big Bro?!

276
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,060
Where's Yosaku? Isn't he with you?

277
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,110
What now? What now?

278
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,520
You guys know each other?

279
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

280
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

281
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,920
before someone else could
beat me to it

282
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:52,560
If the world is going to change

283
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,560
before I can even attain my dream

284
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:06,640
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

285
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:20,020
so that my memories won't fade

286
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,190
I guess we need a cook, huh?

287
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,650
They say there's a "Sea Restaurant."

288
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,410
A navy ship's firing its cannons!

289
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,290
Alright! Leave it to me!

290
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,660
The restaurant's that way, you idiot!

291
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,730
I'll go apologize!

292
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,260
What's taking so long?!

293
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,740
Let's check it out and get some food!

294
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,580
Huh?! A fight?!

295
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,700
What's with him?

296
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,580
On the next episode of One Piece!

297
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,500
"Famous Cook!
Sanji of the Sea Restaurant"

298
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,550
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
