2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,740
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,140
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:53,290
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:00,890
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:08,810
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:16,010
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:25,140
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,270
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,150
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,240
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,410
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:52,000
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,440
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:04,970
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,400
In an attempt to obtain gold,

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,320
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,130
the crew split up into Nami's escape
team and Luffy's search team.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,700
They agreed to meet again on
the eastern shore, then departed.

21
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,550
Luffy's team ventured through
the unsettling forest

22
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,450
as they headed for ruins in the south,

23
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,660
but they were attacked by a giant
snake and wound up separated.

24
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,210
This isn't good...

25
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,250
I returned to our course,
but no one is coming...

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,490
Did I get separated?

27
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,650
Oh, no! I got separated! Huh?! Huh?!

28
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,890
H-Help! Where is everyone?!

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,150
Where are they? I look away for
a second and this happens...

30
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,590
Oh, well. I'm sure they'll manage somehow.

31
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,150
I got most of the map memorized,
anyway. It's to the right.

32
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,720
Yeesh, where'd they all go? Am I lost now?

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,370
Oh, well. Guess I'll go ahead
and wait at the ruins.

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,820
She said "straight south,"
and south is in a warm-ish direction!

35
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,540
This way!

36
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,500
Meanwhile, Wyper and the Shandian warriors

37
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,300
headed for God's Shrine to defeat Eneru.

38
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,280
However, Eneru, who uses Mantra to see all,

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,600
let his priests use the entire island
as locations for their ordeals

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,680
to begin a game of survival.

41
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,830
"The Deadly Reject!
War Demon Wyper's Resolve"

42
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,360
When I first met you, I said one
reason I became a soldier-for-hire

43
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,380
was because Blue Sea people
cannot handle sky combat.

44
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,590
Sky combat? What's that?

45
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,720
Hmm. In that case, place that barrel there.

46
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,760
Barrel?

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,820
--Watch...
--What're we doing this for now?

48
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,450
You will see.

49
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,270
Try crushing that shell with all your might.

50
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:16,200
Gently now, Sanji! If you smash a
hole in the deck, you're gonna pay!

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,500
Hit it with all your might.

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,320
Quit saying whatever you want
when it's not your ship!

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,780
Alright, if that's what you want...

54
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,830
Wait! Wait! You don't need
to swing it that hard!

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Hey, what're you doing?

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,550
I know I told you to hold back,
but you didn't even crack the barrel...

57
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,640
No, I hit it as hard as I could. I was
ready to put a hole in the deck...

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,470
Hey!

59
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,600
Yet, it's almost like this
shell absorbed the shock...

60
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,300
Now, point the dial's holes at the empty barrel

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,100
and press the back tip of the shell.

62
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,910
You know how to press it, yes?

63
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,620
Click...

64
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,980
That is an Impact Dial.

65
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,840
It can absorb and freely
release shocks given to it.

66
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,200
Normally, they're affixed to the
palms using gloves or bandages.

67
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,160
They're powerful enough that a direct
hit can kill your average person.

68
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,710
Usopp... This is...

69
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,670
Yeah... This is what that dumpling priest used!

70
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,820
It is different from a hit!

71
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,180
Impact!

72
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,840
But why couldn't you have said so sooner?!

73
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,140
That freaked me out, you geezer!

74
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,360
I hear there existed even more
powerful dials in ancient sky islands.

75
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,350
Now-extinct "Reject Dials" that
could release ten times the energy

76
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,490
of these Impact Dials...

77
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,280
But they were a double-edged sword,

78
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,710
as the excessive shock from using
them put the user's own life at risk.

79
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,460
Though, naturally, it seems
they were hardly ever used...

80
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,270
There're shells that dangerous?!
Those're practically weapons!

81
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,930
I thought dials were more
common, everyday objects...

82
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes, they are.

83
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:07,000
But what seems useful can
always be used for evil as well,

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,400
depending on who uses it.

85
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,340
Dials are extremely useful,

86
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,370
but that makes them all
the more powerful in battle.

87
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,230
For example, even a
Heat Dial used to warm food

88
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:30,220
can turn a spear into a controllable,
high-temperature "Heat Javelin."

89
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,260
A flame-storing Flame Dial,
placed inside a bird's mouth,

90
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,310
can create the truly rare "fire-breathing bird"...

91
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,040
Yeah, Chopper did mention stuff like that!

92
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,270
--And that's "sky combat"?
--Yes.

93
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,740
Blue Sea people unfamiliar with dials
cannot ascertain our techniques.

94
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,620
The same is true for our
many types of artificial clouds.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,100
The warriors of the sky
are trained to master them;

96
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,910
those with no knowledge of
them do not stand a chance.

97
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,900
Then is there some reason
behind the "Mantra" thing

98
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,250
that lets them read our
movements ahead of time?

99
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,740
Mantra, huh...?

100
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,060
I'm unable to use it myself,
so I can't explain it very well,

101
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,360
but it is said that "Mantra"
is a listening ability.

102
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,520
Supposedly, just by living, people
give off voices from their bodies.

103
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,010
--Voices?
--Yes.

104
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,490
By listening to them, one can allegedly
tell what a person will do next.

105
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,830
With further mastery, you can hear
voices over an even wider area.

106
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,920
The priests can hear all throughout Upper Yard,

107
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,470
and Eneru's powers extend
across this entire land.

108
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,980
And those powers are all too mysterious.

109
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,930
Because of them, the people of this
land have no time to feel at ease.

110
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,220
Have they reached the bottom yet?

111
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,100
Yes. They are already waiting eagerly.

112
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,720
There are the three priests' ordeals,

113
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,980
on top of Commander Yama's
fifty Divine Soldiers...

114
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,990
God. You're waging all-out war.
Is such severity really necessary?

115
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,900
We're only dealing with a few
Shandians and Blue Sea people.

116
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,460
Festivals are more fun the livelier they are.

117
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,260
Plus, you're making light of the
underlying power of sky combat.

118
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,930
Underlying power?

119
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,620
Yes, that's right.
They'll show you soon enough.

120
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,220
Banana.

121
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,760
Now, then. We have fifty
Divine Soldiers and three priests.

122
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,700
Including me, that makes 54 people.

123
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,770
Currently, there are twenty
Shandians heading for the island,

124
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,460
there are four Blue Sea people in the forest,
and four attempting to escape.

125
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,460
No, make that three. I doubt
the old man can fight now.

126
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,830
81 people, altogether!
This will be a battle for survival.

127
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,450
Shall I guess how many will have
fallen three hours from now?

128
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,410
Honestly... You're so quick
to make things into games.

129
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,270
Oh, come now!

130
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,900
Hey, you guess.

131
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,120
Eh?! M-Me?

132
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,500
No, I have no understanding
of such things, so...

133
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,370
Huh? What's with you? Don't be a
party-pooper. Just use your hunch.

134
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,480
Okay, then. You guess!

135
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,100
Y-Yes...

136
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,060
Well, the three priests are powerful enough,

137
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,670
but the fifty Divine Soldiers
are all quite strong as well...

138
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,230
So I doubt many of them
will be defeated at all,

139
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,260
but the enemy is also strong enough
to compete with the priests...

140
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,050
Given three hours, I suspect
thirty people will fall.

141
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,270
Therefore, about fifty will survive...

142
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,480
I see! Fifty, huh?

143
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,220
But don't you think that's
a little too optimistic?

144
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,830
You're underestimating this battle, you know...

145
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,210
Then, what do you predict, God?

146
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,550
All right, allow me to answer straight-out.

147
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,900
In three hours, only five of the 81
people on this island will be standing.

148
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,750
What the...?!

149
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,090
My body!

150
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,720
W-What the...?! I can't move!

151
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,930
Hello there, Shandians.

152
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,440
Looking good.

153
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,760
Forgive my rude welcome.

154
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,330
Shura!

155
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,420
Yes, yes. I know my name.
I don't need you all to tell me.

156
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,130
It's unfortunate news for you...

157
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,990
...but Upper Yard's layout has changed
from how it was until last night.

158
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,430
Can't move, can you? That's just fine.

159
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,590
The survival rate is 3%...

160
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,890
...here in the String Ordeal!

161
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,820
The String Ordeal?!

162
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,290
I would say watch out,
but it's too late for that now.

163
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,670
String Clouds?!

164
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,970
Indeed. I'm impressed you could tell.

165
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,240
What covers my area are String
Clouds so fine they can't be seen,

166
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,830
but are so strong in bunches that
they can stop even grown men.

167
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:08,040
And you pulled them all in yourselves
from the island's entrance.

168
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,860
Look closely. You're covered in strings.

169
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,370
This is what they mean by,
"You reap what you sow!"

170
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,190
Except...

171
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,090
...for one of you!

172
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,010
Let's go, Fuza!

173
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,760
Wyper!

174
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,600
Don't assume you can match me in mid-air!

175
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,020
Watch out! It's a Heat Javelin!

176
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,680
Why would you throw your shield
and gun away?! Are you a fool?!

177
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,540
No, he wouldn't...!

178
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,460
If you want a shoulder, you can have one.

179
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,470
An Impact, huh?! Such things can't defeat me!

180
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,470
No, it's ten times the energy.

181
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,810
Reject!

182
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,460
The Upper Yard survival game...

183
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,100
One has dropped out. Eighty remain...

184
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,560
The first battle ends in a great upset...
Shura has been defeated.

185
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,880
M-My word! Shura-sama has?!

186
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,850
He underestimated sky combat, too. The fool!

187
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,600
But is this not cause for distress?!

188
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Two priests, undefeated for six years,
suddenly fall in under two days!

189
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,330
No. It can't be helped that they were defeated.

190
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,100
They must not have had
God's divine protection...

191
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,100
Alright, men! We're up against twenty
Shandians and seven Blue Sea people!

192
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,640
This will be easy. There is no need
to trouble the priests with them.

193
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,920
Go, and wreak havoc to your hearts' content!

194
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,480
"The 50 Divine Soldiers of Skypiea"

195
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,080
Those who can step over comrades
and keep moving, come with me!

196
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,790
Today... Eneru's head will be mine!

197
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,590
Once we defeat Eneru, we won't need
to revere a single bag of Vearth.

198
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,170
A single bag of Vearth...

199
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,780
Wyper! Are you trying to die?!

200
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,300
Try using the Reject Dial one more time!
Your body'll be blown apart!

201
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,960
So what about my body?
Isn't that called "resolve"?!

202
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,470
These guys can't be beaten
without such sacrifices!

203
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,100
That bastard!

204
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,620
What're you standin' around for?

205
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,870
Braham!

206
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,120
We're behind enemy lines now.
Let's all split up.

207
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,210
There are still two priests out there.

208
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,960
Seems they've changed
the locations of the ordeals.

209
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,050
We don't wanna all get caught
in the same ordeal again.

210
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,250
There's no reason to be that stupid...

211
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,760
I'm going on ahead!

212
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,470
Fine! Do what you want!

213
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,810
At least pray for everyone's good luck!

214
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,650
Alright, guys! Watch yourselves out there!

215
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,910
Let's meet at God's Shrine!

216
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,420
Who're you?! What have you done?!

217
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,970
--Heso!
--A Divine Soldier?!

218
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,140
Indeed! By God Eneru's orders,

219
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,930
we've been sent to clean out all of Upper Yard!

220
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,890
Accept the fact there is no escape
from us fifty elite Divine Soldiers!

221
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,220
Taste the wrath of the Axe Dial,
which does not exist in Skypiea!

222
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,830
Out of the way!

223
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,520
Even deeper! Even sharper!

224
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,490
Axe Dial!

225
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,080
Shields have no effect!

226
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,440
♪ The islands in the south are warm... ♪

227
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,590
♪ Pineapple-ple, head all warm,
what a dummy... ♪

228
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,420
A goat? Was that a goat? Where is it?

229
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,170
A goat in a forest?

230
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,890
Aww, man! Jerk got my hopes up!
And I was all excited to see a goat!

231
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,980
Second verse!
♪ The islands in the north are cold... ♪

232
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:06,760
♪ All chilly-like, head all shivery,
what a dummy... ♪

233
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,830
Oh, it's you!

234
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,540
What are you doing here?

235
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,960
I warned you to leave this island!

236
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,650
Shut up! I can do what I want.

237
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,820
No, you can't. This island
belongs to us Shandians!

238
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,090
Eh? It does? I thought it was God's...

239
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,300
Really? Well, pardon my intrusion.

240
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,660
Third verse!
♪ The eastern-- ♪

241
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,570
--Wait!
--What do you want?!

242
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,700
No, I have nothing to say.

243
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,080
Nor do I want to hear any of your garbage.

244
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,830
I simply want to eliminate you!

245
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,080
Oh.

246
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,030
That's nice and easy to understand, then!

247
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,220
Racing full speed ahead as always

248
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,980
A to Z, we run through it

249
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,810
We all have worries and fall many times

250
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,730
But we just need to rise to the top someday

251
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:32,200
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

252
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:40,270
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

253
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,770
I never treat you "bad"

254
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,420
How many times did we fall?

255
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:55,560
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

256
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,070
Smile! Come back to you, friends

257
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,880
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

258
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,810
Come back to you, friends

259
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,640
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

260
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Come back to you, friends

261
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,710
Right, right, right...

262
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,700
Where the hell did Luffy and the others go?

263
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,390
Who're you?!

264
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,470
I should never have come!

265
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,890
The forest has become quite lively...

266
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,550
I ain't the type of guy who'll die when told to.

267
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,680
I accept this survival challenge!

268
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

269
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,480
"Fierce Midair Battle!
Pirate Zoro vs. Warrior Braham"

270
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
