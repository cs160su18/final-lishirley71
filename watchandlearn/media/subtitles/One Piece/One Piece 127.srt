00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,110
I am... I am... the man
who'll be King of the Pirates!

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,320
Please... stop fighting!

21
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,880
The battle will end...

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,380
The rain falling right now...

23
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,710
...will fall again as it used to...

24
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,420
...since our nightmares are... all over...

25
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,540
"A Farewell to Arms!
Pirates and Different Ideas of Justice"

26
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,050
The nightmares are over...?

27
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,420
You can't be serious!

28
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,180
There's no way what happened
was just "nightmares"!

29
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,350
That's right! We saw the king
attack Nanohana with our own eyes!

30
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,950
That's right! Koza-san was
also shot by the Royal Army!

31
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,690
How do you explain the Royal
Army's misconduct up until now?!

32
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,600
That's not good enough for
those who fell in this rebellion!

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,950
That's right! That's right!

34
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,750
Drop your weapons! Royal Army!

35
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,720
Chaka-sama!

36
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,650
Chaka...

37
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,820
Hey, what's going on?

38
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,740
You...

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,490
Ma-ma-ma...

40
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,660
You too, Rebel Army!

41
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,270
I... Igaram-san!

42
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,900
Squad Captain!

43
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,710
Igaram...

44
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,500
Igaram-san...

45
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,100
Let us meet safely at our motherland.

46
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,840
That's the old pervert from Whisky Peak!

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,350
--So he was alive!
--Uhm, who's that?

48
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,650
Hey, can you talk?

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,820
Yes...

50
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,020
That's the boy from Nanohana...

51
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,610
That's right... He's the kid who
was harmed by the Royal Army.

52
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,520
It's not true... They weren't
the ones who hurt me...

53
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,870
Everyone, listen! I saw it!

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,710
I just can't feel relaxed without this on!

55
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
It's vague!

56
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,060
That's right... This battle was
a plot from the beginning...

57
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,900
--Koza-san!
--Leader!

58
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,060
I will explain everything...
that happened to this country.

59
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,200
Everyone, drop your weapons!

60
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,260
Vivi-sama!

61
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,740
Where's... everyone?

62
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,900
Hey, walk steady.

63
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,560
Ahh... Well, listen... I'm coming down
with "if I walk more, I'll die" disease...

64
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,690
Then stay there.

65
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,500
What?! Well, w-wait! Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey!

66
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,990
Why're you pulling me by my foot?

67
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,360
--Hm?
--Found him?

68
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,450
Who are you?

69
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,290
Ahh... Thanks for carrying
that guy on your back.

70
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,170
He's one of ours. I'll take him now.

71
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,630
Then you're the pirates who
brought Vivi back to this country?

72
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,060
Who are you, old guy?

73
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,200
Daddy!

74
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,050
Everyone!

75
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,430
Ah, it's Vivi!

76
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,450
Daddy?

77
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,900
Vivi-chan's father?!

78
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,110
Are you the King?

79
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,910
I prepared myself to die at
one point, but he saved me...

80
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,820
When his body was exhausted
after the fight with Crocodile,

81
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,640
he carried two people
and rushed above ground.

82
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,140
What unbelievable strength...

83
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,510
Then there's no more need
to worry about the poison?

84
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,480
Right. It should be neutralized by now.

85
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,010
But his injuries need to
be treated... Yours, too...

86
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,340
More importantly, Vivi, go already.

87
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,770
--What?
--Go back to the Square.

88
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,070
Of course! The rebellion has finally stopped.

89
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,730
It wouldn't be proper if the king
or princess didn't say a few words.

90
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,250
Yes... then I'll tell them about you, too.

91
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,980
Vivi-chan. You know how it is...

92
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,080
We're notorious.

93
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,450
We have no intention of
getting involved with a country.

94
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,870
I'm hungry.

95
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,540
We're going on ahead to
the palace. I'm exhausted.

96
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,690
Okay, understood, Captain Smoker.

97
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,180
Then Crocodile-san was...?

98
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,380
This guy was the ringleader for everything...?

99
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,700
Good heavens... I can't believe it...

100
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Hey, look at that! It's the Navy!

101
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,600
We were told that a Baroque Works-owned
artificial rain-making ship

102
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,220
was discovered with dance powder on it.

103
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,210
Sir Crocodile, president of the
secret crime syndicate Baroque Works

104
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,170
and one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea...

105
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,190
Where did the gator go?!

106
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,110
In the name of Navy Headquarters, an agency
directly under the World Government,

107
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,520
I hereby strip you of your
authorization to capture enemy ships,

108
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,610
as well as all the titles and rights
bestowed upon you by the Government.

109
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,440
Just wait and see...

110
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,160
We've done an irreparable thing...

111
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,370
Leader...

112
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,100
I don't know what to say to them...

113
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,800
It's just natural to regret.

114
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,480
That unbearable feeling is also natural...

115
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,440
King...

116
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,940
Your Majesty...

117
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,810
We lost so much and gained nothing...

118
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,450
However, this is a step forward!

119
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,410
No matter who you fought against,
the battle did occur and has now ended...

120
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,560
King...

121
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,010
No one can make the past go away.

122
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,470
Overcome this war and survive...!

123
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,540
He truly is without equal...

124
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,700
Alabasta Kingdom!

125
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,270
The battle that will be
engraved in history and...

126
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,920
...the battle that will never be told...

127
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,320
...have ended...

128
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,430
Smoker-kun! What on earth is this rain?

129
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,420
Don't tell me you used the Dance Powder?!

130
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,560
You idiot.

131
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,300
I do know better than to commit a crime.

132
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,990
The Alabasta King kept
his hands off of this powder.

133
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,060
What's the point in me going
against his morals now?

134
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,770
Oh, excuse me. I apologize.

135
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,510
I can't believe the "White Hunter"
of all men would say something sweet.

136
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,490
I wonder if you've mellowed out a little...

137
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,570
That's none of your business.

138
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:52,120
At any rate, you're really something,
using my elite unit just to look for a ship.

139
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,500
Very upset... I'm upset!

140
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,880
We joined the Navy in the
same year. Don't say that.

141
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,510
You always say that. I pity Tashigi
for the troubles you put her through.

142
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,320
More importantly, take in
this artificial rain-making ship.

143
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,140
Why?

144
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,150
And also, Tashigi will bring
Crocodile here. So take him, too.

145
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,960
Give me a break! What makes
you think you can be so selfish?

146
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,040
Heads!

147
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,970
It's tails. You lose.

148
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,780
You're really selfish, you know that?!

149
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,640
You haven't changed a bit since we
joined the Navy. I'm disappointed.

150
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,550
That's fine. I'm well aware of it.

151
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,270
That's an order.

152
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,560
Sergeant Major! This is
a very rare opportunity!

153
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,280
Once they come to, we won't be able to...

154
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,240
I will not allow you to lay
a hand on them right now!

155
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,220
Wh-Why?! They're all sitting ducks right now!

156
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,040
O-On top of that...

157
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,780
Leader... Are your injuries okay?

158
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,550
You're not gonna die, are you?
Uhm, Toto-ojisan was... Yuba was...

159
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,980
Vivi... Looks like you're still
the worrywart as always...

160
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,660
I don't know about Yuba,
but my stubborn old man won't die,

161
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,520
no matter what happens.

162
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,100
--Leader...
--And I've got his blood in my veins.

163
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,490
As soon as I get treated, I'll head to Yuba.

164
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,570
I'll keep you updated... so don't worry.

165
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,930
Okay...

166
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,600
It's raining!

167
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Rain! It's raining for
the first time in three years!

168
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,570
This rain will end the rebellion!

169
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,590
Our foolish sons will come back!

170
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,210
It's raining!

171
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,690
Just how long are you gonna
stay so stubborn, old man?!

172
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Yuba is already finished.
What're you gonna do here by yourself?

173
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,690
Are you gonna die with the city? Old man!

174
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,670
Look... Koza. The rain has fallen.

175
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,210
Just three years... That's all.

176
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,620
Right... rain...?

177
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,320
The rain is no longer forced and
falls endlessly within the kingdom.

178
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,880
Vivi-sama... You're still up?

179
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,340
Igaram...

180
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,300
Can't sleep?

181
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,350
It's not that.

182
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,520
I just don't want to.

183
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,240
I just wanna keep watching this rain.

184
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,070
About Pell...

185
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:17,470
He is the most dignified and
strongest among the warriors I know.

186
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,710
Yes...

187
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,820
I wanted to say "thank you" to him...

188
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,350
He'd be... greatly honored by that...

189
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,550
Captain Smoker, Miss Hina!
Sergeant Major Tashigi has arrived.

190
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,710
Welcome back.

191
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,860
It's been a while, Tashigi.

192
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,380
Hina-san...

193
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:58,260
Hello... I'm... a little tired,
so I'll go get some rest...

194
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,810
Captain Smoker, I've just returned!

195
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,860
Yeah, thanks for your work.

196
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,060
I heard about what happened
with the Straw Hats.

197
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,980
I'm sorry...

198
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,480
I helped the pirates and let our
opportunity to capture them slip away.

199
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,330
I know that my actions
were shameful as a marine.

200
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,080
Why do you apologize?
Didn't you follow your justice?

201
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,220
No... that's not it...

202
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,550
Sergeant Major...

203
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,800
I just... didn't have any other choice...

204
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,930
Losers can't speak about justice.
We're in that kind of sea.

205
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,920
Where did the gator go?!

206
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,420
Tell me!

207
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,820
Even when I knew where the enemy was,
all I could do was tell him where...

208
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,750
Even when I knew the time of the attack,
all I could do was assist them...

209
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,940
There was... no justice that I could follow...

210
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,480
Those who you thought you
were on par with up until recently

211
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,510
are becoming more
notorious and rising rapidly.

212
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,730
They know that in this sea,
they'll die if they don't rise up.

213
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,580
Go forward or die?

214
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,200
Who decided to come to this sea?

215
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,830
Excuse me... but I'll go rest a bit.

216
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,340
You idiot...

217
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,460
If you're frustrated enough
to cry, become stronger!

218
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,240
I will!

219
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,700
I wish you guys had guts like that, too...

220
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,840
Now, bring them to the ship!

221
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,710
Yes, sir!

222
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,300
Captain Smoker! You have a
communication from Headquarters!

223
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,170
Hm?

224
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,280
This is Navy Headquarters.
Is this Captain Smoker?

225
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,330
Speaking.

226
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,730
In regards to your subduing Crocodile,

227
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,660
it's been decided that the top
officials of the Government

228
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,380
are going to give you and
Sergeant Major Tashigi a medal.

229
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,190
Subduing...? Hey, wait a sec!
It wasn't us who took Crocodile down.

230
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,740
Were they really listening to the report?

231
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,950
Furthermore, each of you will
be promoted by one rank, so...

232
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,620
Hey! Listen up!

233
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:20,810
The ones who've been fighting Crocodile
and his Baroque Works all this time

234
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,300
were the Straw Hat gang.

235
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,340
It's no use, Smoker-kun.

236
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,980
The Government is probably
going to cover up this incident.

237
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,540
Everyone at the Government was
outwitted with regard to Alabasta's crisis.

238
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,100
You think they can tell the world
that it was saved by pirates?

239
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,410
Therefore, we'd like both of you to
attend the medal award ceremony and...

240
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,860
You can't be serious!

241
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,360
Smoker-kun! Accept it!

242
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,400
If you disobey the top officials,
you don't know what'll happen to you!

243
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,850
We took Crocodile down?!

244
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,790
My subordinate is in tears
because we couldn't do it.

245
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,320
Hey, you... Could you tell the old
geezers at the top something for me...?

246
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,000
--Huh?
--Smoker-kun!

247
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,460
"Go to hell"!

248
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:27,700
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

249
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,620
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

250
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,870
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

251
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,300
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

252
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,550
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

253
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,970
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

254
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,760
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

255
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,520
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

256
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,780
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

257
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,810
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

258
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,740
A never-ending journey to be together

259
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,340
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

260
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,160
Uhm, I'm Usopp, chief of
the party department.

261
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,240
Thanks to all of you, we were able to
take down the detestable Crocodile...

262
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,640
Hm? Hey! Don't eat it yet!

263
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,670
Well, when we think of it,
it was a tough battle.

264
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,270
Okay, okay! Well then, everyone!
Eat, drink and party like crazy for now!

265
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah!

266
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

267
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,750
"The Pirates' Banquet and
Operation Escape from Alabasta!"

268
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
