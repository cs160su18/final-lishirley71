2
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,750
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,700
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,790
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,560
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,410
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,760
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,450
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,450
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,260
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,070
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,990
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,880
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,380
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,010
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,840
Here, Ghin. Let him eat it.

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,030
Sanji-san...

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,530
Thank you!

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,780
This is a good restaurant.

28
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,300
I'll take this ship.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,340
So... that's what you want...

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,760
Meat Ball of Doom!!

31
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,150
You're damn annoying!!

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,620
Don't defy me!

33
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,660
When I tell you to prepare food,

34
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,170
all you have to do is
obediently follow orders!

35
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,920
Don't defy me!

36
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,710
There's probably enough
for 100 meals in this.

37
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,960
Bring it to your ship right away.

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,180
--Owner Zeff!
--Owner Zeff!

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,770
Z... Zeff?

40
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,670
"Protect Baratie!
The Great Pirate, Red Foot Zeff!"

41
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,080
What're you doing?!
What're you thinking?!

42
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,030
If we revive even those on the ship,

43
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,920
our restaurant will be
completely taken over!

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,710
If they have the will to fight, that is...

45
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,100
Right, defeated warrior
of the Grand Line?

46
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,050
C... Can't be...

47
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,400
Don Krieg is a defeated warrior...

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,770
Then even the ruler of
the East Blue couldn't...

49
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,070
Even the pirate fleet with
50 ships couldn't sail across...

50
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,030
Grand Line?

51
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,660
Y... You must be Red Foot Zeff!

52
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,690
So you are alive...

53
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,260
An incomparable pirate who was
a cook and yet also a captain...

54
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,490
So what if I'm alive?

55
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,140
It has nothing to do with you.

56
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,270
As you can see, I live as a cook now.

57
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,360
If you put it that way, it sounds nice...

58
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,150
...though rather than living as a cook,

59
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,360
it looks like you can live only as a cook.

60
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,830
Red Foot Zeff was a master of kicks
who never used his hands in battle.

61
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,330
I hear that his strong
legs crushed bedrock

62
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,630
and even left footprints on steel.

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,830
And Red Foot referred to your shoes,
which were covered in the blood

64
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,580
that spattered as you
kicked your enemies down...

65
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,310
But you no longer have
that precious leg of yours...

66
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,890
I've heard the rumor...

67
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,190
How unlucky for you to
have an accident at sea...

68
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,910
To you, losing one of your legs
must mean you are unable to fight.

69
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,910
What about fighting?

70
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,940
I can cook without a leg
as long as I have these hands.

71
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,830
What're you trying to say?
Just come right out and say it!

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,570
Red Foot Zeff.

73
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,000
You're the man who once entered
the Grand Line and came back unhurt...

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,130
There should be a
logbook with the full year of

75
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,810
your journey chronicled in it...

76
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,560
Give that to me!

77
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,440
Whoa! You've been to
the Grand Line, too, pops?

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,360
Yeah...

79
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,410
My logbook, huh?
Indeed, I have it with me.

80
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,540
But I can't give it to you.

81
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,970
The logbook is the pride of all
the crewmen that I traveled with.

82
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,280
It's too important to give it to you.

83
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,510
Then, I'll just take it from you by force.

84
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,760
It's true that I fell from the Grand Line.

85
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,470
Even if that's the case, I'm still
Don Krieg, the strongest man.

86
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,190
It's merely a dark sea route.
To sail across it, I had enough power...

87
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,860
...and forces... as well as ambition!

88
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,950
The only thing that was regrettable
was that I lacked information.

89
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,320
I just didn't know things...

90
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,940
I'll take your logbook.

91
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,580
And I'll form a large pirate fleet
again and seize the One Piece.

92
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,290
And then, I'll stand on top
in this Great Pirate Era!

93
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,330
Hold on a second!

94
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,410
I'm the one who's gonna
be King of the Pirates!

95
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,230
Chore boy!

96
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,860
Hey, back off, chore boy!
You're no match for him!

97
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,530
I can't back off on this.

98
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,000
Did you say something, kid?

99
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,090
I can let it pass...

100
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,000
You don't have to. I just stated a fact.

101
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,960
This isn't a game.

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,920
Of course not.
I'll conquer the Grand Line.

103
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,830
It's no joke, you brat!

104
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,740
It's true that we didn't
have information,

105
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,870
but a fleet with 5,000 men was
wiped out in just seven days!

106
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,930
That's a devilish sea!

107
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,970
There's no way someone
like you can sail across it!

108
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,160
S-Seven days?!

109
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,890
Krieg's pirate ships were
wiped out in just seven days?!

110
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,230
What on earth happened?

111
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,850
Unfortunately, I don't find
those kinds of jokes funny.

112
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,970
If you're not going to let it drop,

113
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,240
then how about I just crush you here...

114
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,830
Go ahead if you can...

115
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,820
Fine by me.

116
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,160
As you wish, I'll send
you to the netherworld.

117
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,410
Gonna fight, Luffy? Need a hand?

118
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,610
I-If you don't need help,
though, th-that's fine too...

119
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,320
Zoro! Usopp! You stopped by?

120
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,980
Don't worry. Just watch from there.

121
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,430
Y-Yeah? T-Too bad,

122
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,680
but if you say so, what can we do...

123
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,410
B-But if push comes
to shove, we'll help you.

124
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,980
S-S-So, g-g-good luck!

125
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,960
What'd you do that for, Zoro?!

126
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,100
Shut up! Just keep quiet!

127
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,650
Are they your crewmembers?

128
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,640
That's quite a small group you got!

129
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,740
What're you saying?!
I've got two more!

130
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,640
Hey! You counted me, didn't you?!

131
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,440
I'll deal with you later.

132
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,150
I'll go feed my underlings.

133
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,830
Those who don't want to die can
abandon the restaurant and escape.

134
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,220
All I'm after are the
logbook and this ship.

135
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,860
But if you still wish
to be uselessly killed...

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,940
...it's a bother, but I'll
bury you into the sea.

137
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,030
Know that.

138
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,040
It's gotten quiet.

139
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,710
Big Bro Zoro went in there.
It should be all right.

140
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,620
Hmm... Are they really okay, though?

141
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,410
If you put it that way...

142
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,290
Say, Big Sis Nami, should we go in, too?

143
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,800
--Big Sis?!
--Ahhh! Ugh!

144
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,020
B-Big Sis Nami?

145
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,980
Hmm? Ahh, what is it?
Is something wrong?

146
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm sorry, Sanji-san.

147
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,950
I never imagined this would happen...

148
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,720
That's not something you
should apologize for, underling.

149
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,850
Each cook at this restaurant acted
as they felt was right. That's all.

150
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,110
Owner! Why are you acting as
if you're taking Sanji's side?!

151
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,070
That's right! He's responsible
for this whole thing!

152
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,570
He's going to put your precious
restaurant out of business!

153
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,450
Shut up, you idiots!

154
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,620
Have you felt what it's like to
be on the brink of starvation?!

155
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,530
Losing food and water
on this grand ocean...

156
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,380
Do you know how scary it is?!
Do you know how hard it is?!

157
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,890
What?! What do you mean, Owner?

158
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,610
The difference between Sanji and you all

159
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,010
is whether you know it or not.

160
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,810
Hmm? What does he mean?

161
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,320
What's he saying that Sanji knows?

162
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,970
If you have time to grumble,

163
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,820
leave the restaurant from
the back door already!

164
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll stay and fight.

165
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,290
I couldn't bear it if I was just
beaten and didn't fight back.

166
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,320
I'll stay, too! This is the
restaurant where I work!

167
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,710
We don't have anywhere
else to go anyway!

168
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,270
What do you think you're doing?!
You saw how powerful Don is, right?!

169
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,150
Hey, Ghin!

170
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,900
Let me tell you something.

171
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,690
Feeding someone who's
hungry is my morality.

172
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,440
But...

173
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,160
...those we'll be dealing with
are plunderers with full bellies.

174
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,790
I won't let you complain even
when I beat up your fellow pirates.

175
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,670
If someone's going to
take over this restaurant,

176
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,380
even if it's you, I'll kill
them without hesitation!

177
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,120
Got that?

178
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,620
Ha! Letting him live and now
killing him? You're hopeless, Sanji...

179
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,060
Shut up, you damn cook!

180
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,980
You see? He's kinda cool, isn't he?

181
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,170
Who cares about him?!

182
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,340
We'd better get out of here now!

183
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,540
Calm down! Even if it's Krieg,
he's a wreck with injuries.

184
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,530
Ghin! You said you didn't know
anything about the Grand Line.

185
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,410
Even though you've been there?

186
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,330
It's still true that I don't know.

187
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,420
What happened on the seventh day
after we entered the Grand Line...

188
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,140
I don't know if it
was a dream or reality...

189
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,970
I still haven't been able
to come to terms with it...

190
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,390
I still just can't believe...

191
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,990
...that the 50-ship fleet...

192
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,070
...was wiped out by only one man...

193
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,310
--What?!
--What?!

194
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,730
It happened suddenly...

195
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,010
As soon as this man appeared,
he sank the ships one after another.

196
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,910
If we hadn't been lucky enough
to have that storm then,

197
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,540
our main ship would've been
completely destroyed as well...

198
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,340
I don't know how many
ships we have left...

199
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,360
It was just so dreadful that I
don't want to accept it as reality...

200
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,600
I don't want to remember...

201
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,300
...that man's...

202
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,560
...sharp, hawk-like eyes whose glare
alone gives one the chill of death.

203
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,260
Wha...

204
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,760
What did he just say?!

205
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,700
That...

206
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,310
...must be Hawk-Eye...

207
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,330
What?

208
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:27,790
That you felt his eyes were like
a hawk's isn't proof in and of itself,

209
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,890
but what this man did is
enough proof that it's him...

210
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,260
Hawk-Eye!

211
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,600
Huh? You know him, Zoro?

212
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,560
Yeah... He's the man I'm looking for.

213
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,320
I went out to sea to meet him.

214
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,770
I see...

215
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,490
Isn't it possible that that man had
some deep grudge towards you guys?

216
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,570
We never did anything to him!

217
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,990
Like you guys disturbed
his nap or something...

218
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,780
Don't be ridiculous!

219
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,870
I'll be damned if he crushed
our fleet for such a reason!

220
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,830
Don't get so worked up.
It's just an example.

221
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,800
I'm just giving an example of what
kind of place the Grand Line is.

222
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,480
What the heck kind of place is that?

223
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,170
It probably means that
anything can happen.

224
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,560
Hey Luffy! Let's not
go to a place like that!

225
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,170
Luffy!

226
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,230
Hey, Luffy?

227
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,170
Ahhh! It sounds so exciting!!

228
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,250
That's how it should be!

229
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,570
You need to get the concept of
"danger" into your thick skull!

230
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,320
But my goal is now completely
narrowed down to the Grand Line.

231
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,790
What?!

232
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,670
That man... I can see
that man if I go there...

233
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,460
Are you guys stupid or what?

234
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,680
Guys like you die before anyone else.

235
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,510
Yeah, but you didn't
have to call us "stupid."

236
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,480
When I decided to become
the strongest swordsman,

237
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I decided to devote my life to it.

238
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,190
Since it was my decision, the only
one who can call me stupid is me.

239
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,690
Ahh! Me too, me too!

240
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,810
Me, too! That's just natural
as a man of the sea!

241
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,160
In your case, that's a lie.

242
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,370
What nonsense...

243
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,210
Hey!

244
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,420
Do you idiots understand
the current situation?!

245
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,120
The ship moored in front
of the restaurant

246
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,150
is the huge Galleon that
belongs to Don Krieg,

247
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,090
Commodore of the "pirate fleet"!

248
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,220
If you wanna escape from reality,

249
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,450
do it after surviving
this life-or-death crisis!

250
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,490
--We're saved!!
--We're saved!!

251
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,500
Great! We're still alive!

252
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,960
It seems like a dream!

253
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,580
We're free from that nightmare!

254
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,030
We came back alive from
the pirate graveyard!

255
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,170
That's right...

256
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,220
which means that we can now
head to the Grand Line again.

257
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,970
Huh? What's with those faces?

258
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,890
A-Are we going to that place again?

259
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,400
No more objections, right?

260
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,240
First, abandon this wrecked ship
that could sink at any moment

261
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,230
and take over the restaurant.

262
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,670
Our enemy's just some punk cooks.

263
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,140
Even if you take your opponent lightly,
that's still more than enough...

264
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,110
Attack!

265
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,030
Here they come!
We can hear their war cry!

266
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,160
We'll protect the ship to
the end! It's our restaurant!

267
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,580
Out of our way, cooks!

268
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,810
What the...?!

269
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,800
What happened?!

270
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,360
Don Krieg!

271
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,280
The main ship was... cut!

272
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,270
Cut?! It was cut, you said?!

273
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,890
This huge Galleon was?!

274
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:18,790
That can't be true!!

275
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,790
Raise the anchor! Or we'll be
swallowed along with the ship!

276
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,620
Yes, sir!

277
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,190
This is bad! Nami, Yosaku and Johnny
are still on our ship out there!

278
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,690
Dammit! It might be too late!

279
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,470
Big Bro! Big Bro!

280
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,000
Yosaku! Johnny!

281
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,540
Are you all right?

282
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,040
Where's the ship?! It's gone!
What happened to Nami?!

283
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,580
That... I'm sorry, Big Bro. She's gone.

284
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,740
See ya! Tell them...

285
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,800
Big Sis Nami...

286
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,820
...that if we're linked
by fate, we'll meet again.

287
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,520
She took all the treasure and ran off!

288
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,810
--Wh-What'd you say?!
--Wh-What'd you say?!

289
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,830
That man is...

290
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,050
Th-That son of a bitch!
He followed us!

291
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,140
Is it possible... that's...

292
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,990
...Hawk-Eye!

293
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,250
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

294
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,970
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

295
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:38,310
before someone else could
beat me to it

296
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:52,490
If the world is going to change

297
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:06,630
before I can even attain my dream

298
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,680
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

299
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,020
so that my memories won't fade

300
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,620
Who's that?

301
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,070
The man I've been looking for. I never
thought I'd be able to see him this soon.

302
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,530
--Are you gonna fight him?
--Yeah. I went out to sea to meet him.

303
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,200
Hey Zoro, what's wrong?

304
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,820
Am I this far from
the world's strongest?

305
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,290
So this is the world's strongest...

306
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,450
--Zoro!!
--Zoro!!

307
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,830
On the next episode of One Piece!

308
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,370
"Hawk-Eye Mihawk! The Great
Swordsman Zoro Falls on the Sea"

309
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,630
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
