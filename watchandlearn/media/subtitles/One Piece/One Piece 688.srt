All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,500
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,830
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

80
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,030
and have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,300
Doflamingo trapped everybody in the country

82
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,120
and set up a game to escape
from his domination.

83
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,460
It's either take him down at the Royal Palace

84
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,520
or kill all 12 criminals
he named, including Luffy.

85
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,710
Everyone has become a hunter
going after Luffy and the others,

86
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,510
while he keeps running to the Palace
where Doflamingo waits!

87
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,530
Gum-Gum...

88
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,080
...Gatling!

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,810
Outta my way!

90
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,710
And while the members of the Straw Hats and

91
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,900
the Don Quixote Family
are clashing everywhere,

92
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,940
Sabo faces Navy Admiral Fujitora.

93
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,610
Prior to the showdown, Sabo revealed...

94
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,850
Is it the Revolutionary Army's job
to give cover to pirates?

95
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,370
Yes, it is.

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,620
As a member of the Revolutionary Army,
I won't let you through.

97
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,500
No, that's not true.

98
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,150
I mean, it's my duty as his brother!

99
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,040
Just remember.

100
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,310
If Luffy ever calls for my help,

101
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,340
no matter where I am in the world,
I'll be there - forget my position!

102
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,130
I never...

103
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,820
ACE DIES

104
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,510
--Sabo-kun!
--Sabo!

105
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,160
...wanna go through that again...

106
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,670
Luffy is...

107
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,400
...my brother to save!

108
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,420
"A Desperate Situation!
Luffy Gets Caught in a Trap!"

109
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,890
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE
LEVEL 1

110
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,770
Go! Go! Go!

111
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,240
That's the Colosseum's Grim Reaper!

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,310
Why does it have Straw Hat on its back?!

113
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,990
D-Don't chicken out!

114
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,240
Everybody, aim for the bull!
Give it concentrated gunfire and stop it!

115
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,410
What about Straw Hat?!

116
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,550
We're no match for that jerk!

117
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,540
If we can stave them off, that's enough!

118
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,420
Bring the bull down and get him bucked off,

119
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,670
then he'll just be a prize in the game!

120
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,470
Don't mess with Moocy!

121
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,660
Moocy! Go! Go!

122
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,790
He's the Grim Reaper! Bow down!

123
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,100
Outta our way! Outta our way!

124
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,580
We're gonna go straight to the Palace!

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,970
Oh! Cabbage!

126
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,600
Straw Hat! I'm gonna go first!

127
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,350
Damn! I thought I was taking a shortcut!

128
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,910
Go way, way faster, Moocy!

129
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,990
No, everybody's catching up to us!

130
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,370
It's Hajrudin!

131
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,770
Outta my way!
I have no business with you small fries!

132
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,960
I gotta keep moving!

133
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,200
Oh, no!
They're gonna get ahead of me!

134
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,240
Shoot, shoot!

135
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,200
There they come, again!

136
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,660
Don't wimp out! Shoot the bull!

137
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,310
We're gonna fall!

138
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,380
Damn! I'm not gonna let them shoot him!

139
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,970
Gum-Gum...

140
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,840
...Gatling!

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,600
...Whip!

142
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,900
I see no end to this.

143
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,860
I'm gonna take out all of them!

144
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,490
Stop messing with Straw Hat Luffy!
You dumbshits!

145
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,600
Rah-Rah-Rah-Rampage!

146
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,790
Who's that?

147
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,140
Hey, don't say such a thing!

148
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,750
I was a contender in Block C, same as you.

149
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,660
THE FUNK BROTHERS - ASSASSINS FROM MOGARO
THE OLDER BROTHER: KELLY FUNK
(FUSED WITH HIS YOUNG BROTHER BOBY)

150
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,660
Kelly Funk!

151
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,140
Were you?

152
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,950
Hey, hey, hey!

153
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,390
We were saved by God Usopp like the others!

154
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,360
I found a shortcut to
reach the higher levels.

155
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,100
You can make it directly

156
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,530
to the Sunflower Field -
right in front of the Palace!

157
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,850
What? Really?!

158
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
Yeah, follow me.

159
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,200
I wanna help you!

160
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,580
Alright! We're gonna overtake Cabbage
and the others in a single spurt!

161
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,910
Let's catch up with him, Straw Hat-san!

162
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,330
We've got a great ally on our side!

163
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,420
Hey, Straw Hat-ya!

164
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,190
When can I get these handcuffs off?

165
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,080
With these Sea Prism Stone shackles,

166
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,900
I'm just going there to
get killed by Doflamingo.

167
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,990
Well, it'll work itself out!
Let's just go!

168
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,170
How can you be so sure?!

169
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,910
Go back to the plateau
where we were before, then!

170
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,250
Why?

171
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll look for the key!
This fight's gonna be win or die!

172
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,230
This way!

173
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,280
See? There's a shortcut!

174
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,540
There!

175
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,460
Kelly Funk! You're a nice guy!

176
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,520
A very nice guy!

177
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:35,110
Now, go ahead, Straw Hat.
We'll guard the entrance!

178
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,940
Alright, thanks!

179
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,570
Moocy, let's go!

180
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,670
Take care.

181
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,020
Good job, Kelly Funk!

182
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,230
Make sure to guard the entrance!
Thank you for your work!

183
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,000
What?!

184
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,740
They fell...
What did they want... after all?

185
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,010
All right!
Don't worry and keep going, Moocy!

186
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,310
Straight to the Sunflower Field!

187
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,050
S-Straw Hat-san...

188
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,840
M-May you be victorious...!

189
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,660
Ring, ring, ring...

190
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,550
--Ring, ring, ring...
--Your Transponder Snail...

191
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,740
--Ring, ring, ring...
--Get it.

192
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,320
--Clank.
--Hello?

193
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,410
This is Luffy!

194
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,410
The man who'll become
the King of the Pirates!

195
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,190
Luffy. It's me.

196
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,190
Robin!

197
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,210
We're still at the plateau
you were at before.

198
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,460
Where are you?

199
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,310
We're at the first level of the other plateau

200
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,800
and heading to a place
called the Sunflower Field.

201
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,350
The Sunflower Field is on the fourth level.

202
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,140
Viola found the key to Tra-guy-kun's cuffs!

203
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,620
Oh yeah?!

204
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,660
Nico-ya, get it to me as soon as possible!

205
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,560
What do you want me to do?!

206
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,730
Hello, this is Leo of the Tontatta Tribe.

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,120
We're gonna escort Rebecca-sama,

208
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,010
Rooster Big Human, and Robiland there...

209
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,370
...at a super high speed!

210
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,680
Let's meet up at the Sunflower Field
on the fourth level!

211
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,040
What? How will you guys catch up with us!

212
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,670
I'll explain later!
See you at the Sunflower Field!

213
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,930
Clank.

214
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,840
See? I told you it's gonna be alright!

215
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,550
It's just a coincidence!

216
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,270
All right! Moocy, run!

217
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,770
Hey.

218
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,730
You said "at a high speed"
but what's your plan?

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,060
Cub-san, please show them!

220
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,900
Come on, Tontatta Airlines!

221
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,800
Yellow Cubs!

222
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,370
S-Something's coming!

223
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,590
What a simple-minded fool...

224
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,070
It went so well, didn't it, Kelly?

225
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,090
He fell into our trap completely.

226
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,350
Let's go.

227
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,510
Wait!

228
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,720
It's Straw Hat.

229
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,740
Let him go all the way in
until there's no place to run,

230
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,710
then, I'll kill him.

231
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,350
I see! You're such a badass!

232
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,330
Is that...

233
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,980
Don't tell me...!

234
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,860
Beetles!

235
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,510
Keep going! Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!

236
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,140
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!!

237
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,090
Thank you for your service!

238
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,380
All right!

239
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,080
Now, we'd like the three of you,

240
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,930
Rebecca-sama,
Rooster Big Human, and Robiland...

241
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,860
...to board these Yellow Cubs!

242
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,110
Oh? What's wrong?

243
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,690
Are you serious?!

244
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,320
No...

245
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
I am serious!

246
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,040
Alright, all of you, hold on to these tight,
one for each of your hands!

247
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,900
These...?

248
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,170
No kidding...

249
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,570
You can't fly people with beetles!

250
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,030
Let's run through the town!

251
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,060
Yeah, yeah! I like her idea!

252
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,220
Now, let me give you instructions.

253
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,430
Aren't you even listening to us, small one?!

254
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,380
This is Tontatta Airlines' Jumping Service!

255
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,800
Big Humans are too heavy
so they can't bear you!

256
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,400
See, we told you!

257
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,850
Did you know about this?

258
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,860
No, this must've been beyond my domain...

259
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,730
We don't have that much time anyway, so...

260
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,660
...just take off!

261
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,850
What?!

262
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,970
We told you we can't fly like this!

263
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,660
Leo, don't push them too far!

264
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,510
Hey, are you alright?!

265
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,100
Damn! Little People!
I'll pay you back for this!

266
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,520
They're gone!

267
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,160
Am I... flying?!

268
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,950
They can't fly you but they can
slow you down when you fall!

269
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,790
So we can't fly like this, can we?!

270
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,870
I'm falling! I'm falling! I'm falling!

271
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,250
Relax!

272
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,640
How can I relax?!
I'm gonna crash into something!

273
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,210
Head for a rooftop!

274
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,770
A rooftop?!

275
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,720
That's right!
And land on it smoothly!

276
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,850
Now! Kick off!

277
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,830
I'm flying!

278
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,460
Kicking off rooftops helps you to rise!

279
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,730
Oh yeah! We can get to the
Sunflower Field like this!

280
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,130
That's right!

281
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,130
I see!

282
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,180
I'm getting the knack of it!

283
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,070
Good! You're doing great!

284
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,270
I feel like I'm a balloon!

285
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,190
Watch out for attacks from below.

286
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,100
Head for the Sunflower Field
on the fourth level, everybody!

287
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,510
LEVEL 4
THE SUNFLOWER FIELD

288
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,530
Roger that!

289
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,450
Roger that!

290
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,620
Got it!

291
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,870
Swim. Swiiim.

292
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,680
Swim. Swim.

293
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,420
Swim, swim, swim, swim... So annoying!

294
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,360
You swimming bastard!

295
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,710
Ugh! What are you showing us,
you mechanical jerk?!

296
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,310
Cut it out, you little tramps.

297
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,140
This is how men fight.

298
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,610
Oh! So hard-boiled!

299
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,140
Let go of me, shithead!

300
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,060
Strong Right!

301
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,430
Where did he go this time?!

302
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,160
That wasn't so bad.

303
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,800
Bring it on.

304
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,450
Fraland...

305
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,470
Inhel, what should we do?!

306
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,010
I have an idea.

307
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,440
An idea?

308
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,530
You asshole!
You just stepped on my sword!

309
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,620
So what?

310
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,580
I'm gonna kill you!

311
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,410
Even when you're mad, your voice is soprano.

312
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,480
That's just a big-ass dull sword...

313
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,720
No matter how many times you try, it's no use!

314
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,060
Two-Sword Style!

315
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,690
I see. That's how it works.

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,850
Enough playing around.

317
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,080
Get ready!

318
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,170
It's about the right time, isn't it?

319
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,180
Kelly, let's go!

320
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,300
Okay!

321
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,400
Hey, Straw Hat-ya.

322
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,500
Isn't this path going downward?

323
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,950
Come to think of it...

324
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,490
Stop! He's soaking in the water!

325
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,380
Huh? But he told us this was a shortcut
to the Sunflower Field...

326
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,470
What?! It's a dead end!

327
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,700
Go back! Hurry!

328
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,560
Moocy! Don't panic!

329
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,480
Somebody's coming.

330
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,960
This is just a slanted water well.

331
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,190
There is no such shortcut in here.

332
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,280
You!

333
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,690
Doflamingo!

334
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,070
Getting stuck deep inside
the dark water well,

335
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,680
Luffy bears the brunt of Doflamingo's attack
and is knocked into the water!

336
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,980
After losing his way to the Royal Palace

337
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,470
and just when the situation couldn't
be more desperate than this,

338
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,100
Luffy strikes a big come-back blow
that blasts away his adversity!

339
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

340
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,620
"A Great Escape! Luffy's
Tide-turning Elephant Gun!"

341
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,870
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
