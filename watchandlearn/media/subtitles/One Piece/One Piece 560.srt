00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

55

kokoro no taiyou shizumanai

60
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
ichi, ni, Sunshine

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:07,380
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,690
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,590
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,530
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,260
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,650
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil

80
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,120
and involved in an all-out war!

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,380
The Noah is turning away. It's
not gonna crash into the island!

82
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,880
Princess-sama saved us
by drawing the ship away!

83
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,640
--Princess Shirahoshi!
--Please escape!

84
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,270
I have to go out to the sea in order
to keep the Noah away from the bubble!

85
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,480
I'll give you one last chance, Shirahoshi!

86
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,850
If you say "Yes," I'll spare your life!

87
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,570
Have mercy, Decken-sama!

88
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,820
Marry me!

89
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,160
You're not my type!

90
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,870
Then go to hell!

91
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,990
We're not gonna let her marry a guy like you!

92
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,380
She's our only baby sister! We're
not gonna let you hurt her, Decken!

93
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,470
Brother Mamboshi-sama! Brother
Ryuboshi-sama! Hoe-sama!

94
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,390
I'm sorry that we suspected you...

95
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,890
Don't mention it. Take me to the deck!

96
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,430
Oh, Hordy Jones!

97
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,300
What happened to Neptune? Did you kill him?

98
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm tormenting Shirahoshi with the Noah now.

99
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,620
Don't you think it's a good idea?

100
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,080
Huh, Bro?!

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,550
I have a good idea too!

102
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,340
What is it? Let me hear it.

103
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,190
If you die now...

104
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,660
What'll happen to this ship?

105
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,160
Decken!

106
00:05:52,200 --> 00:06:01,210
"The Fierce Fight Begins! Luffy vs. Hordy!"

107
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,700
Hordy! You... squirt!

108
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,680
My left hand...

109
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,960
...touched you.

110
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,520
What are you doing, you bastard?!

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,070
You betrayed me first, Decken.

112
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:17,080
Honestly, I panicked a little when this
ship covered up the sky over the island.

113
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,580
But it was a good idea to break the bubble.

114
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,340
The Fish-Man Island would be washed away

115
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,550
but we'd still have the Fish-Man District.

116
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,510
If you die here and now, your Mark-Mark
power will become ineffective

117
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,430
and this ship will fall onto
the Fish-Man Island again...

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,520
Then it will destroy everything.

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,150
Now, more than anything, I want all of
those annoying Straw Hats to be gone.

120
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,480
Thousands of my men will die too

121
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,830
but I can just get more human
slaves, as many as I like, later.

122
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,500
Thousands will die, huh?

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,750
That's good. But first,

124
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,880
you...

125
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,090
...drop dead!

126
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,560
You fool! Don't do it!

127
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,800
Become a martyr for the New Fish-Man Island.

128
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,490
You'll die soon.

129
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:33,510
Then the ship will start falling again and
it will fall onto the Fish-Man Island.

130
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,390
Since I'm a kind man, I'll
make your dream come true,

131
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,080
the very least I can do, before you die.

132
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,390
I'll kill Shirahoshi for you!

133
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,460
He stabbed Decken! What kind
of relationship do they have?!

134
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,860
This is no time to think about
that. Hordy's gonna come this way!

135
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,240
We're gonna stop him!

136
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,360
Out of my way, you fools!

137
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,870
You stupid interlopers!

138
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,920
Brothers-sama!

139
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,010
Shirahoshi! Get away at full speed!

140
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,020
Now you're out of the Hard Shell
Tower - it's so easy to kill you.

141
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,200
It's no use!

142
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,040
The Merfolk may be the

143
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,550
fastest swimmers in the world but
I'm way faster than you right now!

144
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,230
Brother-sama!

145
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,280
Shirahoshi!

146
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,380
Hordy!

147
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,990
Gum-Gum...

148
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,170
...Snake Shot!

149
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,600
Luffy-sama! Brother Fukaboshi-sama!

150
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,230
--Straw Hat!
--B-Brother!

151
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,610
Sorry to be late. I was
caught up in strategizing.

152
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,930
You bastard!

153
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,660
CONCHCORDE PLAZA

154
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,660
Meanwhile, at Conchcorde Plaza
on the Fish-Man Island...

155
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,790
Captain Vander Decken-sama abandoned me!

156
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,630
I need you to become a

157
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,720
sacrifice upon Shirahoshi's
death, along with the island!

158
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,140
Why don't you fight, Sea Bonze!

159
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,140
Please! Do something about the Kraken!

160
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,690
--Beat him up, Kraken!
--You're strong!

161
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,040
They're both huge but he doesn't
seem like he wants to fight.

162
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,690
The Kraken will defeat him!

163
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,640
Hey, Great Monk! You must have misheard him!

164
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,750
What Decken said to you was "I'll
leave the plaza up to you!"

165
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,500
What?

166
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,380
That means he wasn't
gonna destroy the island!

167
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,760
But he said "Become a sacrifice."

168
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,310
He wanted you to fight hard as though
you were going to sacrifice yourself.

169
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,100
Do you think so?

170
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,630
Yes. Isn't that right, guys?

171
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,700
Huh? Y-Yeah... he's right!

172
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,520
How lucky to be trusted
by your captain that much.

173
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,190
--You're amazing!
--It's time for you to man up!

174
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,910
Oh, that's what it was!

175
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,060
No, it wasn't.

176
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,450
Now, take this

177
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,080
and beat the Straw Hats up with us!

178
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,190
The Energy Steroid!

179
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,390
No way. It's not gonna
work on that giant body!

180
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,270
It's working tremendously well!

181
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,070
What?!

182
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,500
Surume!

183
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,960
Captain Decken! I'm sorry
that I didn't trust you!

184
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,710
Yeah! He beat the hell out of the Kraken!

185
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,630
--What happened? Are you all right?!
--It's no good! He passed out!

186
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,090
Are you guys my enemies too?!

187
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,850
He's like a different person!

188
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,020
Leave it all up to me!

189
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,510
Where is my enemy?

190
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,920
Th-That guy right there, Wadatsumi!

191
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,470
Is that him?

192
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,430
All right!

193
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,720
Watch out, Jimbei-chan!

194
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,180
Fish-Man Karate!

195
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,020
7000 Brick...

196
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,190
...Roundhouse Kick!

197
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,490
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

198
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,480
How could he do such a giant
creature that much damage?!

199
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,640
Nami-san!

200
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,940
Oh no! The wind blast brought Nami-san down!

201
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,570
Get up, you bastard!

202
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,200
Ouch! Who is it this time?!

203
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,060
You big shit!

204
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,360
What would happen if you
so much as make a scratch

205
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,290
or two on our beautiful navigator?

206
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,860
Unbelievable! His kick worked too!

207
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,080
How strong is his leg that it
can hurt a giant like him?!

208
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,890
Oh no!

209
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,940
I got messy.

210
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,720
That wasn't my fault!

211
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,910
I will fight you, Great Monk!

212
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,410
Pay with your life, you Jumbo Steamed Bun!

213
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,790
How strong can they get?!

214
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,610
Mil Fleurs!

215
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,730
Help us, Hyouzou-san!

216
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,720
Old man, can I get a wasabi octopus?!

217
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,360
No, you're not in a bar! Plus,
you shouldn't eat octopus!

218
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,890
Don't be mean!

219
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,330
It's no use! He's completely drunk!

220
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,210
How pathetic!

221
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,570
If you can prove yourself now,

222
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,890
it's your chance to become
an officer in one move.

223
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,320
I knew a little surprise
attack like this wouldn't do.

224
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Who are you?

225
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,620
I'm the soon-to-be No.1 Fish-Man
swordsman - Nuru-sama!

226
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,750
What?

227
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,050
--What's wrong?
--Is it a hangover?

228
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,680
Hyouzou-san!

229
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,880
You're not too bad!

230
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,790
You're weak.

231
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,380
Can you say the same thing after this?!

232
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,210
So bright!

233
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,140
If you can't see, you can't
defend yourself from my sword!

234
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,980
Take this!

235
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,930
What?

236
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,410
You only use your eyes to
see. That's why you're weak.

237
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,670
Go train some more and come back!

238
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,550
That was just dumb luck!

239
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,560
I'm gonna be the No.1 Fish-Man
swordsman, I won't lose...

240
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,530
Who is No.1?

241
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,670
Stop!

242
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,870
Hyouzou-san, we're on your side!

243
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,300
--He looks strange.
--That's not how he gets drunk usually!

244
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
He's much stronger!

245
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,630
Tottering Hash!

246
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Sh-Shields don't work!

247
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,780
He was writhing in agony without
any injury until a while ago!

248
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,220
Are you kidding? This is like what
happened when Hordy-san changed.

249
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,120
Hyouzou-san has become a monster, too?!

250
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,420
It feels great! I feel a surge of energy!

251
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,790
Oh, I wanna cut more people!

252
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,670
Let me cut you!

253
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,950
Run! Somebody, stop him! There's
no way to defend ourselves!

254
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,140
It could be anybody!

255
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,600
I found one!

256
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,740
H-Hyouzou-san got stopped!

257
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,830
You look tougher than the
anglerfish I just beat.

258
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,810
Zoro!

259
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,380
Sorry. I'm gonna take this guy.

260
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,890
This will be a nice warm-up
before we go to the New World.

261
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,690
It gets less powerful in water as I thought.

262
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,900
"Less powerful"?

263
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,030
Stupid lowly creature!

264
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,380
Don't you know where you
are?! You're in the deep sea!

265
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,790
A human like you has no
chance to win a fight!

266
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,450
On top of that,

267
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,750
everything will come to an end soon.

268
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,960
Whether it's Shirahoshi or the
Fish-Man Island or your friends!

269
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,390
A fool like you can't protect anything!

270
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,340
No.

271
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,120
I'll protect them all!

272
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,990
That's what I worked for...

273
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,090
...those 2 years!

274
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,390
The Straw Hats are battling the

275
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,970
officers of the New Fish-Man Pirates.

276
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,790
The new, stronger attacks the crew has
learned in their two years of training

277
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,430
continue to be revealed.

278
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,640
Far above them,

279
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,560
the Noah is getting closer by the second,

280
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,810
as it descends to destroy Fish-Man Island.

281
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

282
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,510
"A Massive Confused Fight! The Straw
Hats vs. The New Fish-Man Pirates!"

283
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
