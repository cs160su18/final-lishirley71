The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

We are best friends

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,810
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,900
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,960
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,600
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,040
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,340
And what do you want, Zoro?

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,730
Zoro and Kin'emon finally
got to see Luffy again

80
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,180
and called the others through the Transponder Snails

81
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,480
and checked how everybody was doing.

82
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,340
We are currently with the King Riku Army,
an anti-Doflamingo coalition in this country.

83
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,620
An army?

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,120
--Of Little People.
--Little People?

85
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,300
And all the people here are looking to
take down Doflamingo this very day!

86
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,170
Huh? A soldier?

87
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,140
He is willing to sacrifice his life
to destroy this kingdom!

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,540
--Franky, stop the army!
--No way!

89
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,380
This brave, little army...

90
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,710
I can't...

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,200
...let them down!

92
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,850
Soldier-san's gonna die.

93
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,340
Franky!

94
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,390
You're free to go all out!

95
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,380
We'll be there as soon as possible!

96
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,210
Thanks!

97
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,180
All right.

98
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,620
Let's go back!

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,150
What?!

100
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,800
I thought you were gonna say that!

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,510
--What's going on?! The town is...
--It's coming this way!

102
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,620
Doflamingo!

103
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,370
Tra-guy!

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,650
Stupid brat!

105
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,860
Hey, Tra-guy! Why are you with Doflamingo...

106
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,600
You've pushed it too far!

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,590
Cora-san...

108
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,220
Tra-guy!!

109
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,700
"Two Great Rivals Meet Each Other!
Straw Hat and Heavenly Demon!"

110
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,050
Hey! I heard some explosions and gunshots!

111
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,180
What happened to Tra-guy?!

112
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,050
Can you hear me, Luffy?!

113
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,810
What's happening there?!

114
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,510
Say something, Luffy!

115
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,930
I'm sorry to bother you all.

116
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,230
He is a Warlord and a pirate - Trafalgar Law.

117
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,750
He was behind the false report of
my abdication from the throne this morning.

118
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,150
He was?!

119
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,930
"Withdraws from the Seven Warlords"?
What's going on?

120
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,400
Dressrosa is finished!

121
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,390
Your Majesty!

122
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,420
Your Majesty! Why did you resign?!

123
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,890
Please give us a reason, Your Majesty!

124
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,900
He was trying to drag me down.

125
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,390
But don't worry!
I've just gotten rid of him!

126
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,440
Is it what it was all about?!

127
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,480
So he almost messed Dressrosa up!

128
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,730
Now we're safe!

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,100
Hey, Mingo!!

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,280
How dare you shoot Tra-guy!

131
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,570
Straw Hat.

132
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,950
It's none of your damn business.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,010
Law was originally my subordinate.

134
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,530
Responsibility for dealing with him
falls to me!

135
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,120
Kin, retrieve Tra-guy!

136
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,200
I got it!

137
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,280
Vice Admiral-dono,
Pirate Hunter is in action!

138
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,090
Should we catch him?

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,280
Uh-huh, all right.

140
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,670
Hold on a minute!

141
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,620
Hey! Talk to us! What's going on?!

142
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,140
Law-dono's got shot in front of us!

143
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,560
By Doflamingo!

144
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,760
What?!

145
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,230
Did you just hear that?

146
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,100
Pirate Hunter and Foxfire Kin'emon, huh?

147
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,600
I saw a child who looked like
Momonosuke on the ship earlier!

148
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,860
Don't listen to him!
We won't let him take Momo away!

149
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,460
Of course!

150
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,560
He is...

151
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,230
Excuse me.

152
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,740
Old man, you're so strong!
Who are you?

153
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,620
I should not tell you that
for the sake of both of us.

154
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,760
What's this heaviness?!

155
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,910
How can he create this much force?!

156
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,280
Zoro!!

157
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,540
Zoro-dono?!

158
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,430
What happened to Zoro, Kin'emon?!

159
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,790
Zoro-dono has just vanished...

160
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,130
Kin'emon!

161
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,050
I'm coming!

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,370
Oh yeah... It's Sea Prism Stone...

163
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,480
Kin'emon-san?! Are you okay?!

164
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,070
Oh no, don't tell me you're dead!

165
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,770
Vice Admiral-dono!

166
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,390
He can launch a sword attack from
a distance? That's dangerous.

167
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,550
Tell the civilians to evacuate
as far as possible from here!

168
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,690
Yes, sir!

169
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,750
I can't believe the blind old
gambler was a Navy admiral!

170
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,520
An admiral?!

171
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,390
He is an admiral?!

172
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,070
I hear you, Kin'emon-san!
Oh, good! You're alive!

173
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,020
Thank you for your help earlier.

174
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,360
You people were nice to me
so it feels like I'm repaying you

175
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,840
for kindness with ingratitude.

176
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,310
Life is full of ironies.

177
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,900
Don't be surprised!

178
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,040
A man who stands by Doflamingo is a...

179
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,340
...N...

180
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,800
...Navy admiral!

181
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,620
What?!

182
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,420
What?!

183
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,900
A Navy admiral is there in Dressrosa?!

184
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,430
Maybe, Doflamingo has
the Navy on his side!

185
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,200
That means there are hundreds of enemies!

186
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,320
It's not a matter of the number!

187
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,770
Just one admiral is already a big problem to us!

188
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,420
Oh no!

189
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,590
Law-dono! Law-dono!

190
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,610
Where are they going?!

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,220
Are you okay?! Say something!

192
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,760
Let's talk at the palace, Fujitora!

193
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,590
If you cooperate with me,
I'll let you catch those brats.

194
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,340
I will listen to what you have to say,
Heavenly Demon.

195
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,230
Then, I will decide what to do.

196
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm not gonna let them get away!

197
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,030
All civilians are evacuated!

198
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,740
Catch Roronoa Zoro!

199
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,790
They know who we are!

200
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,490
It seems like they do!

201
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,420
Let's run for now!

202
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,050
Tra-guy!

203
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,890
This is Kin'emon!
Law-dono has been abducted!

204
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,270
What?!

205
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,100
Hey, Luffy! Look for the exit now!

206
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,930
We're gonna wait for you
by running around here!

207
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,100
Okay! We gotta hurry!
Tra-guy said something after being shot!

208
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,400
I'm sure he's alive!

209
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,970
It's Brook and the others!
What happened now?!

210
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,620
W-W-We...

211
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,290
Sunny! What's wrong?!

212
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,130
There they are!

213
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,400
Damn! They've found us!

214
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,800
We have a problem!

215
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,620
Big Mom's...

216
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,800
...Pirate ship is here!!

217
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,160
Ship! Ship!

218
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,030
What is the ship of one of the Four Emperors
doing here?!

219
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,400
What?!

220
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,500
Its figurehead is singing, isn't it?

221
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,340
Ship! Ship!

222
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,470
Catch them!

223
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,640
You sure?! Big Mom's ship?!

224
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,720
We're gonna die!

225
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,370
What's going on?!
Is Big Mom on board?!

226
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,300
--Luffy! Run with us while talking!
--Okay!

227
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,450
I don't know!

228
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,740
But I see those two that we
met on the Fish-Man Island!

229
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,250
Mama! I see Caesar! Grr!

230
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,250
They have him with them
as we thought-bon!

231
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,360
Let's sink their ship
and recover just Caesar-soir!

232
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,550
Big Mom?! That's what I'm concerned about!

233
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,050
Luffy! You shouldn't have
picked a fight with her!

234
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,630
Seems like they're here for Caesar!

235
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,220
Caesar?!

236
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,170
What do they want from him?!

237
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,590
Everybody wants you, you mad scientist!

238
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,510
Did they come to rescue you, too?!

239
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,970
No!

240
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,490
Please help me!

241
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,680
I don't wanna get caught by Big Mom!

242
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,980
Because I...

243
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,620
...swindled research funds from them!

244
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,940
What?!

245
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,210
W-Well...

246
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,930
Skip the details! They're gonna kill me

247
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,280
once they catch me and confirm
that I've been fooling them!

248
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,650
I don't care if you live or die!

249
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,520
Don't say that! Please!

250
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,460
We can't let anyone take
you anyway so shut up!

251
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,930
Look! Look! Look!

252
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,810
They're gonna shoot at us!

253
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,940
Somebody, take the helm!

254
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Y-Y-Yes, I will!

255
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,020
Damn! Why now?!

256
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,810
We're rolling away from Dressrosa!

257
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,610
Can you shake them off?!

258
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,990
How do I know?!

259
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,850
Just pray!

260
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,320
--Brook! Keep trying!
--Yes, I'll keep trying!

261
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,850
You okay, Sanji?!

262
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,270
But hey, don't bring the Emperor here!

263
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,530
It'll throw the whole country out of control

264
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,480
and mess up the plan of Toy
Soldier and the others!

265
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,620
Come to think of it,
why is Caesar on the Sunny?!

266
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,710
The deal fell apart!

267
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,990
If not, why would Tra-guy
have to go through it?!

268
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,900
Stop!

269
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,200
Law told us to take Caesar
to the next island!

270
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:22,350
Sanji-kun, I think we shouldn't
go back to Dressrosa!

271
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,480
I know you want to join them
and rescue Tra-guy

272
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,320
and help the Little People's army
win the fight.

273
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,370
I'm not saying this because I'm scared!

274
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,310
Luffy, listen!

275
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,890
There are three things that we and
Doflamingo are scrambling for!

276
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,810
Caesar.

277
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,980
The SMILE factory.

278
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,870
And Momonosuke for whatever reason.

279
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,410
We haven't destroyed the factory yet
so it's still in his control.

280
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,690
But we have the other two with us here!

281
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,900
Tra-guy was sacrificing himself and fighting

282
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,280
to let these two get away from Doflamingo.

283
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,260
Maybe, he also wanted to buy time
for destroying the factory.

284
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,480
He went that far to save these two.

285
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,300
So if we go back and make it easier
for Doflamingo to catch them,

286
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,780
all his efforts will be ruined!

287
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,810
You're right. Okay!

288
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,380
We will take Tra-guy back at any cost!

289
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,560
What was the name of the next island?!

290
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,160
It's Zou.

291
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,300
Sanji!

292
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,890
Nami!

293
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,800
Chopper!

294
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,570
Brook!

295
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,700
Momo!

296
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,940
You go ahead and sail for Zou!

297
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,200
If you say so... Roger that, Captain!

298
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,620
But how about giving us permission!

299
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,990
Permission?

300
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,390
Yes. Permission to...

301
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,190
...launch a counterattack
against Big Mom's ship!

302
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,370
Yeah, you got it.

303
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,530
What?!

304
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,950
No!

305
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,490
I already picked a fight with her!

306
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,900
You're right!

307
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,280
--It's too dangerous!
--Please don't!

308
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,750
All right, guys!
We'll be waiting for you at Zou!

309
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,820
Okay!

310
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,230
Count on us to destroy the factory!

311
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,030
All of you, be safe!

312
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,450
Roger that!

313
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,430
Roger that!

314
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,320
Tra-guy's life...

315
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,030
Rebecca's wish...

316
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,290
He holds the key to all of that!

317
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,440
We're gonna head for the palace!

318
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,130
And...

319
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,260
...beat the hell out of Doflamingo!
