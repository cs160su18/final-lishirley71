2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,600
With his special body,
he is a General Zombie.

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
This man hails from Wano
Kingdom in the New World!

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,230
Wh-What gives? I thought
he was going to attack us.

50
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,030
I-It doesn't matter!
C'mon, let's make a break for it!

51
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,410
The door is wide open!

52
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,240
--You're right!
--Y-Yeah!

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,330
Three-Pace Hum... Notch Slash!

54
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,760
That hurt, you bastard! Lemme out, dammit!

55
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,720
--What was that?
--Bastard, lemme out! I mean it!

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,800
I'll let you have it if ya don't let me out!

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,430
--A casket?!
--Open the lid!

58
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,390
That voice...!

59
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,240
What's he doing?! Sheesh!

60
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,310
Did that idiot get caught?

61
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,810
Straw Hat!

62
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,820
Now then, we'll hold the
wedding ceremony right away.

63
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,980
I've already dealt with the preparations.

64
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,690
Put me down! It was you, wasn't it?

65
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,240
You're the invisible man
who was in the bathroom!

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,530
My name is Absalom.

67
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,990
It is the name of your future husband.

68
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,250
You'd best remember it!

69
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:37,380
I haven't been babying my skin
every day for a perverted beast!

70
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,720
We're getting out of this forest.

71
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,630
I won't let you escape!

72
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,620
Monkey, monkey!

73
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,940
Immortal zombies are blocking the
paths in front of you and behind you.

74
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,410
Now say your prayers!

75
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,610
Hey, wait! What're you doing?!

76
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,820
Coup de...

77
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,320
...Vent!

78
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,240
You've demolished the breezeway!

79
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,290
Cien Fleurs!

80
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,620
Wing!

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,590
All of them fell into the courtyard.

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,590
I doubt that finished them off...

83
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,430
What is that?

84
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,640
This bag of bones goes...

85
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,770
Ka-bone!

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,070
"Appearing from the Sky!
That Man Is the Humming Swordsman!"

87
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,790
Whoa, stop! You can't do this!

88
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,590
Don't kill her! She's my friend!

89
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,460
Darn boar! Stupid sow! Stop!

90
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,510
Hightail it, Nami!

91
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,310
Wait, you vile Cat Burglar!

92
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,810
No!

93
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,390
--I'm going to take Absalom to be my husband!
--Stop, dammit!

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,900
--Get off of me!
--No!

95
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,190
Now say your prayers!

96
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,450
H-

97
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,410
Hold your horses!

98
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,910
I...

99
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,740
I...!

100
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,660
I'm actually a man!

101
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,920
Whoa, there.

102
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,590
I-Is that true?

103
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,140
S-Sure is! I just cross-dress for fun!

104
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,930
Gimme a break!

105
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,680
Besides... I think you and Beast Man
would make an awesome couple!

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,770
I was totally shipping you!

107
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,810
--Really?
--Really! Gimme a break!

108
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,020
No one has ever encouraged me to
pursue my feelings for him before...

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,910
You're the first person to offer
such kind words of support.

110
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,460
I... I...!

111
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,100
Raise your head, my friend.

112
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,800
This is what you call "friendship."

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,590
I am Namizo. Please call me "Nami."

114
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,180
Friendship...? Nami!

115
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,310
You tamed her!

116
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,150
You know, like, I'm always trying
to catch him when his guard is down

117
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,400
so I can get a fingerprint
on the marriage certificate.

118
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,780
But his guard is never down!

119
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,530
He even manages to avoid touching the paper

120
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,240
when I play dirty and hold him in an armlock!

121
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,450
Really, Lola! You're
going about it all wrong.

122
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,080
You're leaving too much room to chance.

123
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,540
Eh?! Eh?! What do you mean?

124
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,170
The thing is, he's resisting
because he's conscious.

125
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,390
You should wait until he's sound asleep.

126
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,960
Attack him in his sleep?!

127
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,680
Is that okay?! Won't it make me a bad person?

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,220
Lola, aren't you a zombie?

129
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,470
I forgot about that! What
a rotten blind spot!

130
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,270
If he isn't asleep, you can knock
him out and that'll work just as well!

131
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,690
Hey, Namizo!

132
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,650
Weren't you gonna escape?

133
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,730
By the way, Lola, I forgot
something in the treasure room...

134
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,900
I'd like to go back and get it,
but I can't recall how to get there.

135
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,410
Could you tell me?

136
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,160
You're such a klutz! Sure, I'll tell you.

137
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,200
The closest way there is
through Perona-sama's room.

138
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,910
Look, see that? Notice the
room with the tiny veranda?

139
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,070
She seriously turns her
misfortune into fortune.

140
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,620
If you keep going straight this way,

141
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,580
you'll hit a staircase.

142
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,580
Nami's a guy?

143
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,030
That will take you to Perona-sama's room.

144
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,030
No wonder I thought
she seemed so masculine.

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,170
From there, you'll head inside...

146
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,390
Hey, Nami! He's closing in on us!

147
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,770
Really? Lola, this is your chance to attack!

148
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,480
I'll never see him again,
so don't worry about me!

149
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,580
Good luck! You two make the best couple!

150
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,030
I'll do my best!

151
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,740
Thank you, Nami!

152
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,490
I'm bursting with courage!

153
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,210
Absalom!

154
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,380
Lola!

155
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,210
Guys, now's our chance!

156
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,400
In the end, the boar didn't hurt us any.

157
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,260
Nami, you're amazing!

158
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,010
Couldn't you tell how nice and honest
she was after we sat down and talked?

159
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,430
There is something very wrong with your eyes!

160
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,990
Master!

161
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,530
We did it, Master!

162
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,660
Cut the crap, you freaks!
And who's this "Master"?!

163
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,250
Lemme outta here right now!

164
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,000
Lemme out, dammit!

165
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,840
Who are you?!

166
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,550
H-Hey, let go! Knock that off!

167
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,170
H-Hey!

168
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,840
Jerks, you'd better be ready for a fight!

169
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,710
'Cause I'm gonna let you have it!

170
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,130
Sheesh! Who the heck are these guys?!

171
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,870
Doesn't this ship have a
single treasure chest?!

172
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,330
There are boxes, but they are all empty...

173
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,380
There is also a tiny bit of money...

174
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,990
Unbelievable! We're hardly getting
anything out of the two ships.

175
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,720
Does this ship really belong to
the man who defeated Crocodile?

176
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,220
Oh, well. Go ahead and pilfer their
ridiculously large supply of food.

177
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,940
--Yes, ma'am!
--Perona-sama!

178
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,810
Hildon...

179
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,860
Moria-sama is summoning the Three Phantoms.

180
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,150
The master beckons? Whatever for?

181
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,410
I've heard that Straw Hat Luffy
has been captured!

182
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,120
He wants to make a show
out of reanimating No. 900!

183
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,570
No. 900?! Is he serious?!

184
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,500
Who're you? You're stinking huge!

185
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,920
Hey, punk! Careful how
you speak to the master!

186
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,760
So you are Straw Hat Luffy?

187
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,210
I'm glad to see that you're doing well.

188
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,030
Is it you?

189
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,030
Are you that moron, Moria?

190
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,490
What a thing to say!

191
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,410
You have quite a bit of spunk
in you. Quite a bit, indeed.

192
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,620
I should have expected as much from
someone with a 300 million Berry bounty.

193
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,670
I imagine you will make an excellent
subordinate in just a moment.

194
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,380
A subordinate?! Screw that!
Who do you think you are?!

195
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,260
Who...? "Who do you think you are," eh?

196
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,770
I am the future King of the Pirates!

197
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,790
Ab-sama! Absalom, you jerk!
Come out and marry me!

198
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,290
You vanished and fled again, didn't you?!

199
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,430
"Evil Be Gone"

200
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,430
--Did we lose him?
--Probably.

201
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,750
I'm sure Lola...

202
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,930
He's coming!

203
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,780
He's headed straight this way!

204
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,200
Over here!

205
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,750
Hurry! Get in here.

206
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,250
What is this?

207
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,610
Beats me, but we've gotta
focus on hiding for now!

208
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,860
What was that...?

209
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,870
That's strange... This is the
only way they could have gone.

210
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
Hey, Kumacy!

211
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,770
Erosalom--er, Absalom-sama,
there is trouble afoot!

212
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,570
Stop, that can wait. My business comes first.

213
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,900
Did three pirates come this way?

214
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,320
Actually, about that--

215
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,910
Absalom!

216
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,730
What are you doing here? This is my room.

217
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,580
Perona...

218
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,120
Welcome back, Perona-sama.

219
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,000
Zip it, Kumacy! How many times
must I tell you not to talk?!

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,670
I know, but I have something important--

221
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,550
Shut up! I don't wanna hear your voice!

222
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,500
I see you're as harsh on Kumacy as ever.

223
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,310
You're beary harsh.

224
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,260
Butt out of it. He's my subordinate.

225
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,080
More importantly, have you heard?
The master is summoning us.

226
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,100
Has there been some sort of incident?

227
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,230
Well, I suppose you could say that.

228
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,480
He's going to reanimate No. 900.

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,030
No. 900?!

230
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,900
Does that mean the
300 million Berry bounty has been caught?

231
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,780
They still haven't found us,
if you can believe that.

232
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,080
It's a miracle!

233
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,330
Why did we hide here in the first place?

234
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,290
We didn't have much choice!

235
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,770
Who knew Beast Man was
gonna catch up so soon?

236
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,630
And I didn't realize this was a zombie!

237
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,880
Let's look for a chance to make
a break for it. Sound good?

238
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,590
Absalom-sama!

239
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,790
So this is where you went!
I have something I'd like to tell you.

240
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,470
What is it?

241
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,640
It looks like we have one more
intruder on top of the pirates.

242
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,350
An intruder?

243
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,810
It's the Humming Swordsman!

244
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,520
What?!

245
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,620
Someone... just fell from the sky.

246
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,330
Hey, what just came hurtling down?!

247
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,500
It couldn't be...

248
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,140
Well, actually, I have a
pretty good idea who it is...

249
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,450
Where the heck did that doof fall from?

250
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,170
Tch! This bites! Guess
we'd better go save him.

251
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,580
Hey, hey!

252
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,190
Despite that bizarre interruption,
you can't escape from me!

253
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,110
I can always make more footing if I have to!

254
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,360
Monkey, monkey!

255
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,260
We'll have to deal with
this headache first, huh?

256
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,490
Buy me a bit of time.

257
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,580
What are you going to do?

258
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,660
Ooh! Those pillars are just what I needed.

259
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm gonna whip up a weapon right quick.

260
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,630
How dare you act like I'm no big deal?!

261
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,210
Don't treat me like a small fry!

262
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,720
Spider's...

263
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,260
...Sticky Net!

264
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,430
He has spinnerets on his hands!

265
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,120
Seis Fleurs!

266
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,060
Slap!

267
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,050
Something touched my eye!

268
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,950
Oh, shoot! I got sticky net in my eyes.

269
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,450
Thanks, Nico Robin! I'm
ready and raring to go!

270
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,380
Get back!

271
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,200
What is that?

272
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,390
Nothing much! I just thrust the steel
nunchakus I had on hand into some pillars.

273
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,050
Ya need a big weapon when
dealin' with a monster like this!

274
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,180
Heavy Nunchaku!

275
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,570
Why is he so powerful?
Isn't he supposed to be human?

276
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Stop--

277
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,970
Tararan is in trouble!

278
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,720
Who are those guys?

279
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,210
At any rate, we need to hurry up there!

280
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,770
S-Stop!

281
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,150
Give it a rest, jerk!

282
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Spider's Sticky Net!

283
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,120
You're lost without your trusty weapon!

284
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,480
You were asking for that!

285
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,550
Weapons Left!

286
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,560
Hey, hey!

287
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,440
Nico Robin!

288
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,650
What are those things?

289
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,110
Mouse, mouse! Mouse, mouse!

290
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,700
I'm sorry. I let my guard down.

291
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
I didn't realize there were more spiders.

292
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,300
C-Crap!

293
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,840
Moron! Monkey, monkey!

294
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,630
It's impossible for you to notice those guys.

295
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,390
They're my subordinates, the Spider Mice.

296
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,700
There are a whopping five
hundred of them in Thriller Bark!

297
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,030
They've never failed to catch
our prey, not even once!

298
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,200
They strike from the darkness
or from their enemy's blind spot

299
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,740
to catch him unawares!

300
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:33,460
Hogback-sama has modified our silk
so that no human could ever break it!

301
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,090
We hung out quietly in the ceiling
and snatched your friends up.

302
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,470
It doesn't matter how strong the person is--
we don't give him a chance to resist!

303
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,220
By the time he realizes what
has happened, it's already too late!

304
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,600
Now we'll take you to the same
place we took your friends!

305
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,490
Brace yourselves!

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,770
How did you get up here?

323
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,910
I jumped.

324
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,490
I'm light!

325
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,160
Seeing as you're here, I suppose
you've left me with no other choice.

326
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,670
I shall tell you everything
about this island.

327
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Hey! Who the hell are you?!

328
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,640
You aren't a zombie, are you?

329
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,050
I bet you're with these pirates!

330
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,020
Hey, Skeleton!

331
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,550
Yes, yes. Not to worry.

332
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,850
The fight is already over.

333
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,720
Huh?

334
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,970
Three-Pace Hum...

335
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,820
...Notch Slash!

336
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,920
Knock it off, you oversized shallot!

337
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,420
I'll get you for this, jerks!

338
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,470
Put some light on him!

339
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,580
Let go of me, dammit!

340
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,800
What's happening? My shadow is...? Stop it!

341
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,850
I've gained a 300 million Berry bounty's
worth of power to add to my forces!

342
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

343
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,320
"Luffy's Emergency Situation!
The Ultimate Shadow's Destination!"

344
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,430
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
