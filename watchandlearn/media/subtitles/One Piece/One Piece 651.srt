We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,390

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340

The unchanging bond will light

We are the one! Go ahead!

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,410
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,510
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,330
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,150
When Luffy found out that the prize for

77
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,150
a fighting event
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

78
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,210
he decided to enter and fight fierce battles!

79
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,040
I don't want to be just protected anymore!

80
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,770
I want to protect Soldier-san this time!

81
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,140
"Protect You to the End!
Rebecca and the Toy Soldier!"

82
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,830
Soldier-san's gonna die.

83
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,600
Soldier?

84
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,180
He's a one-legged toy soldier.

85
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,070
A toy?

86
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,800
Oh, elderly people!

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,780
Do you want me to carry
your bag or something?

88
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,360
Oh?

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,630
Am I funny?

90
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,230
I met a guy like that
in front of the Colosseum.

91
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,550
Yeah, I guess that's him.

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,740
We're not allowed out of the Colosseum.

93
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,490
We can't do anything if there's
something going on out there.

94
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,400
You're worrying that a toy is gonna die?

95
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,270
A living toy seems really odd to me.

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,750
You're not from here
so maybe it's hard to understand.

97
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,610
They're the same as humans.

98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,810
They are friends for the friendless.

99
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,450
They are siblings for those who have none.

100
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,900
They are lovers for the loveless.

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,830
I don't understand why they
aren't allowed to live with us.

102
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,270
Since the day I lost my mother
who was my only family,

103
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,530
Soldier-san raised me.

104
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,040
He's like a father to me.

105
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,380
I see. So that toy is...

106
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,830
Thank you for waiting!
The ring has been fully prepared!

107
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,090
Rebecca, the match is gonna start.

108
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,110
Uh-huh.

109
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,650
Hey, what are you doing, Lucy?

110
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,220
When we struggled earlier,
the two lunch boxes fell on the floor.

111
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,830
Sorry! You emptied your
wallet to buy me these.

112
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,940
But they still taste good!

113
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,930
You don't look like a prisoner to me.

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,480
Buy me lunch again sometime!

115
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,480
See you at the finals.

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,460
Yeah!

117
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,950
Good luck!

118
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,930
We're gonna start the match!
Competitors of Block D, enter the ring!

119
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,400
Alright! I'm gonna win the Flare-Flare Fruit!

120
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,000
Say whatever you want now!

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,580
Mother-sama!

122
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,700
Mother-sama, I picked so many flowers!

123
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,520
Wow, Rebecca!

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,310
Would you like to have one?

125
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,840
Thank you. I would like to.

126
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,400
And this is from your mother to you!

127
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,460
Okay, let's go.

128
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,310
Uh-huh!

129
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,380
1, 2! 1, 2!

130
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,900
1, 2! 1, 2!

131
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,040
We sold all the flowers today!

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
Yes, we did.

133
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,810
Maybe people bought them
because you're so cute!

134
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,350
Let's eat!

135
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,590
Go ahead. Dig in.

136
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,910
You must be tired
from walking all over the town.

137
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,640
Yeah, I'm so hungry!
My stomach was growling!

138
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,740
Oh no!

139
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,950
--It's yummy!
--Yeah!

140
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,280
The King Riku Army is setting
the village on fire!

141
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,020
Please stop!

142
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,380
Why is the king doing this?!

143
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,820
The palace is on fire!

144
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,010
What's going on in this country?

145
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,330
Go! Don't let them get away!

146
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,270
Run, Lady Scarlet!

147
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,840
--Who are you, shorty!
--Outta our way!

148
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,760
Run!

149
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,260
As far as you can!

150
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,620
Mother-sama, I'm hungry.

151
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,120
I know.

152
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,250
We haven't eaten anything
for two days.

153
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,320
Rebecca,

154
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,290
do you think you can stay
here alone for a while?

155
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,440
Promise me to stay here, no matter what.

156
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,490
I'm gonna go buy something to eat.

157
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,180
Uh-huh!

158
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,160
Mother-sama!

159
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,570
I... I couldn't protect her!

160
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm sorry!

161
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,490
I couldn't protect your mother!

162
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,350
She told me to give you these.

163
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,260
She said that you're waiting here hungry.

164
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,390
Mother-sama, I'm hungry.

165
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm gonna go buy something to eat.

166
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,680
Mother-sama?

167
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,620
Mother-sama...

168
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,100
Mother-sama!

169
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,370
Mother-sama!!

170
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,580
I saw a trail of blood on the staircase!

171
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,350
They must be hiding somewhere!
Let's search!

172
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,670
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,690
I'm sorry!

174
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm sorry!!

175
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,380
You have to eat.

176
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,330
I-If you don't want it, I'm gonna eat it.

177
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,340
Okay?

178
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,060
I'm really gonna eat it!

179
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,230
Your mother was high-born.

180
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Do you know we have a new king now?

181
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,120
The new king wants to capture
all the former nobility.

182
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,040
He even wants to capture
you because you have

183
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,600
your mother's blood in your veins.

184
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,980
Although I couldn't protect your mother,

185
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,620
I'm gonna protect you to the end,
with my life!

186
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,040
Until the day you are filled with happiness,

187
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,850
I will always be by your side!

188
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,250
I want my mother!

189
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,060
I don't like you, Soldier-san,

190
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,700
because you couldn't protect my mother!

191
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,840
H-How do you like this?

192
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,740
Or this?

193
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,600
Or this?

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
Where are you going, Rebecca?!

195
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,860
I'm going home!

196
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,640
You can't!

197
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,520
The new king's friends

198
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,210
are all over the town
and at your house looking for you!

199
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,430
Doflamingo-sama!

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,200
Doflamingo! Doflamingo!

201
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,520
The Riku family has been running
this poor country for centuries!

202
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,390
In the end, they became shameless and robbed

203
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,550
money and goods from citizens for themselves!

204
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,260
I'm gonna make this country wealthy, instead!

205
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,990
I didn't know toys are capable to work.

206
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,720
I need money!

207
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,760
Rebecca!

208
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,260
Idiot!

209
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,940
Look! I'm unbreakable!
I'm unbreakable and strong - a super toy!

210
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,560
Soldier-san is a brave man

211
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,990
He will always be by your side

212
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,340
She must be feeling cold.

213
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,760
With this tin body, I don't feel anything.

214
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,000
Isn't this warmer?

215
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,400
Yes, it's much warmer!

216
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,030
Soldier-san is a brave man

217
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:07,140
He will always be by your side

218
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,060
How much is the rent here?

219
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,760
It's abandoned so you can just use it.

220
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,800
Since the King Riku Army ransacked this area,

221
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,710
so many residents have moved away.

222
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
It's warm in the house!

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,300
Close the window.

224
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,810
No.

225
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,990
There are other toys.

226
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,590
Other children as well.
Go out and play with them.

227
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,280
I guess you're gonna be safe here.

228
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,140
Since there are other people in the village,

229
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,910
we have to follow the law.

230
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,340
After you fall asleep at night,
I'll go back to my toy house.

231
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,500
But I'll be back before you wake up.

232
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,360
To let you know I'm here all the time,

233
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,930
I'll drop a new flower
petal through the crack

234
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,700
in the window every morning.

235
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,080
Good morning, Soldier-san!

236
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,790
Yeah, good morning!

237
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,250
You little monkey!

238
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,100
There are so many clothes that would fit you!

239
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,310
Cute!

240
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,510
Cool!

241
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,560
W-We're not here shopping for me.

242
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,280
Go ahead and pick out what you want.

243
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,380
Yes!

244
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,910
Ta-dah!

245
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,190
You're small but you really go at it!

246
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,370
I need money.

247
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,790
H-Hey!

248
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,480
I need money!

249
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,050
Happy Birthday, Rebecca!

250
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,370
It's yummy!

251
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,470
Here!

252
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,440
Rebecca! Try to catch this!

253
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,600
Ouch!

254
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,590
How did you like it?!

255
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,020
Hey!

256
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,590
What do you want?

257
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,590
Um...

258
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,990
Read this!

259
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,560
Hey!

260
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,000
W-Why?

261
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,750
Here!

262
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,910
Here!

263
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,170
Bye-bye!

264
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,530
Bye-bye!

265
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,760
She must be an orphan.

266
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,890
She has no family who cares about her.

267
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,800
Rebecca!

268
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,550
Rebecca!

269
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,470
Where are you?!

270
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,140
Rebecca!

271
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,110
Rebecca!!

272
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,920
She's cute. We probably can
sell her for a high price.

273
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,080
Rebecca!

274
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,710
Rebecca!

275
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,720
Hey, that strange toy is chasing us.

276
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,230
Rebecca!

277
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,580
Soldier-san!

278
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,780
Who cares.

279
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,000
He's not gonna catch up with us.

280
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,460
You bastard!

281
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,680
You're just a toy!
Don't stand against humans!

282
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,900
I'm gonna destroy you!

283
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,220
Soldier-san!

284
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,560
Rebecca!

285
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,270
They put me on the wanted list.

287
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,940
I'm on it, too! Let's find a new place!

288
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,300
I want to live with you one day,
in the same house.

289
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,690
Let me teach you how to fight.

290
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,390
There's no need since I have you.

291
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,630
If something happens to
me, what are you gonna do?

292
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,430
Come on!

293
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,600
My mother said I shouldn't hurt anyone!

294
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,470
I'm gonna teach you how to not get hurt!

295
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,990
Come on!

296
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,990
I don't wanna do it anymore!

297
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,050
Take up your sword!

298
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,630
Alright, here we go!

299
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,040
Listen. We're not playing here!

300
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,030
Faster!

301
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,870
Use the lower half of your body!

302
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,710
We're gonna do this everyday!

303
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,540
What?!

304
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,540
He has always been by my side

305
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,470
and he saved me so many times.

306
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,840
Here she comes!

307
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,610
Are you all ready?!

308
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,560
She's the most beautiful
gladiator in the Colosseum!

309
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,220
The "Phantom Princess"!

310
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,300
No one else can make
the place heat up like she does!

311
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,720
Please don't die, Soldier-san!

312
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,310
I won't...

313
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,560
--Screw you, Rebecca!
--Cut her to pieces!

314
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,670
King Riku's line - burn in hell!

315
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,130
A corrupted family!

316
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,910
...give up, either!

317
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,750
What?!

318
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,270
Why does everyone hate her so much?!

319
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,210
She's a very nice person! Screw them!

320
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,740
She bought me lunch...

321
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,060
I know!

322
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,560
But Rebecca's grandfather is...

323
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,400
...despised by the whole country!
He's the former king!
