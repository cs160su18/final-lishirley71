2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,560
Separated from Buggy and Mr. 3 on level 3,

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,030
Luffy headed to the lower
levels with Bon Clay!

51
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,160
Summon all the other forces
of Impel Down to level 4!

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,660
Roger that!

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,260
If they manage to get away from Minotaurus
and come down here to the Burning Heat Hell,

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,160
I'll execute them with my own hands!

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,000
There's a huge amount of hot air and smoke!

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's hard to even stand here!

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,330
Right! But...

58
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,810
...this is level 4--the Burning
Heat Hell where you wanna go!

59
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,690
Burning Heat? Is it down there?

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,500
You said you were gonna break out!

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,260
Straw Hat!

62
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,560
I knew you'd want to come with me!

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,700
No one wants to follow you to hell!

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,000
Anyway, you take this! The
special weapon--Muggy Ball!

65
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,300
Alright! Gum-Gum...

66
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,210
...Mallet Rifle!

67
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,520
We did it!

68
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,810
We beat the monster of hell!

69
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,120
"All Forces Have Gathered! The Battle
on Level 4 The Burning Heat Hell!"

70
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,200
How much time left until Ace's execution?

71
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,670
29 hours. Everything's gonna
be over at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

72
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,090
But only if everything
goes according to plan.

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,600
We'll transfer Portgaz
D. Ace tomorrow morning.

74
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,460
Luffy!

75
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,110
If I could only know you
were safe, I'd want nothing else!

76
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,110
IMPEL DOWN LEVEL 3 INSIDE OF THE WELL TOWER

77
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,780
Alright, let me ask you once again.

78
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,120
Okay!

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,750
You still wanna go down to level 4?

80
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,630
Yeah! I knew you'd want to come with me!

81
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,020
I'm not going at any cost!

82
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,960
My body will melt away completely!

83
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
How many times do we have
to tell you, bonehead?!

84
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,100
Can't you see the plumes?!
It's the Burning Heat Hell!

85
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,350
We're not gonna go to level 4!

86
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,330
Why not?!

87
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,310
It's obvious!

88
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,650
We wanna escape! E-S-C-A-P-E!

89
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,030
That's right! We wanna go up! Understand, up?

90
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,200
Wow! I got a really big, bloody booger here!

91
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,120
You're not listening!

92
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,620
Whew! Straw-chan, let them go!

93
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,540
They don't have the balls to go further!

94
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,500
Whose nose looks like a ball?!

95
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,590
What's that?! How did you hear me?! Ha-ha!

96
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,430
I made up my mind! I'll just spin!

97
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,180
Ha-ha-ha! Gimme a break!

98
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,900
Hey! It looks like ceiling is rising!

99
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,060
Ah! You're right!

100
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,490
I hear a rattling, too. I
think if I'm not mistaken...

101
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,780
...that we are falling!

102
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,440
Oh no!

103
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,830
My Muggy ball was so powerful,
it caused the floor to collapse!

104
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,380
No way, it's because of my heavy kick!

105
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,040
You're wrong! It's because
my punch was so strong!

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,680
No no! My Wax-Wax power was...

107
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,640
Oh! I didn't do that much...

108
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,020
Then, shut up!

109
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,020
We're gonna get burned by hellfire!

110
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,190
Help us!

111
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,960
LEVEL 4--THE BURNING HEAT HELL

112
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,010
Hey, don't do it! You can't kill us!

113
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,510
Whatever happens, you deserve it!

114
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,470
How many people have you killed?

115
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,680
Get them!

116
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,270
--We deeply regret what we've done!
--Yeah, we're really sorry!

117
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,190
Don't!

118
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,450
I'm burning!

119
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,580
Help me!

120
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,290
Keep lugging firewood! Hustle!

121
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,570
It's too hot.

122
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,090
My whole body...
even my guts are gonna get burned!

123
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,150
I'd rather die than stay on this floor!

124
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,550
I can't take it anymore!

125
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,970
Get out of my way! Move it!

126
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,600
A prisoner is escaping!

127
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,610
Hey! Outta my way!

128
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,610
Do you want me to throw
you into the sea of fire?!

129
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm gonna fall!

130
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,210
Hey! You're not allowed
to beat other prisoners!

131
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,590
Do you wanna get executed right here?!

132
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,970
FORMER BAROQUE WORKS ASSASSIN--
DAZ BONEZ A.K.A. Mr. 1

133
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,410
Your condition has been granted. Now, you...

134
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm well aware!

135
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,160
I'll follow the orders
to convene as I promised.

136
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,570
Welcome back!

137
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,370
Thank you. Escort the Snake
Princess to her quarters.

138
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,160
Yes, sir. This way.

139
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,960
I'll bring you a meal right away.

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,130
I don't want it. Reduce
the amount from now on.

141
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,260
Really?

142
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,550
Don't question me! Such insolence!

143
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,680
I-I'm sorry, Madam.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,890
Vice-Admiral Momonga!

145
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,190
What's wrong?

146
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,110
We got a report that Red-Haired
had a run-in in the New World!

147
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,280
Impossible! It must be a mistake!

148
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Why now? Who did he fight against?!

149
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,240
It's hard to believe but it's
Kaido of The Four Emperors!

150
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,490
Kaido?!

151
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,910
Headquarters believes that
Red-Haired intercepted Kaido...

152
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,170
...and stopped him from attacking Whitebeard!

153
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,460
But it wasn't a large battle.

154
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,780
That kind of thing is bound to happen!

155
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,090
That's how insecure the sea is now!

156
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,910
A brush with The Four Emperors is...

157
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,720
a serious matter that's beyond our
control in these circumstances.

158
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,680
Maybe, there's absolutely no way that
we can avoid the war against Whitebeard!

159
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,910
Do you think that it'll be an all-out battle?

160
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
One side is Whitebeard Pirates - the
strongest pirate crew in the world.

161
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,580
The other side is all the forces of
the Navy including three Admirals

162
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,670
and The Seven Warlords of the Sea!

163
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,060
No matter who wins, the
war will become history!

164
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,970
--Let's hurry to Marineford!
--Yes, sir!

165
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,180
What's going on?

166
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,850
Magellan, Hannyabal, and the
demon guards are all here!

167
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,480
What's gonna happen on this floor?

168
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,230
LEVEL 4 IN FRONT OF THE STAIRCASE
THAT LEADS TO LEVEL 3

169
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,230
It's really hot here!

170
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,440
Fasten your fireproof coat!

171
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,110
Straw Hat Luffy and others
should come out from this door!

172
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,870
No information yet?

173
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,290
Maybe they got beaten by Minotaurus.

174
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,320
Wardens should not hide!

175
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,080
Come out of there right now!

176
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,210
Don't open it without
notice! It's too bright!

177
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,140
When you pass the seat on to
me, I want it to be more open.

178
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,000
Shut up! This was custom-made for me.

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,520
I prefer to stay closed up in a dark room!

180
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,090
I want to keep my heart closed from you, too!

181
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,320
It's coming!

182
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,450
No way!

183
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,580
What?! It's a toilet as well?!

184
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,520
That's so gross!

185
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,040
I can hear you!

186
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,510
If I knew that we'd have to wait this
long, we would've gone to level 3...

187
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,890
...directly!

188
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,470
No need to rush, Sadie-chan!

189
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,240
I'm fine but these kids are
always lusting for blood, so...

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,020
...they're losing their patience.

191
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,490
DEMON GUARD MINOKOALA (HAWKISH)

192
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,630
DEMON GUARD MINORHINOCEROS (BASHFUL)

193
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,510
DEMON GUARD MINOZEBRA (SHY)

194
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,220
There's been an update!

195
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,850
Straw Hat Luffy is now inside
of the Well Tower on level 3

196
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,610
so they can't monitor him!

197
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,940
What?!

198
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,150
If they make it out of there, I'll
lay the blame on Warden and...

199
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,950
Ouch! I really wanna become the warden!

200
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,950
I mean, it really hurts
to be hit by the warden!

201
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,790
It'll be easier for us if they
would just fall from there.

202
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,590
There's the boiling Pool of Blood under
there and they're all Devil Fruit eaters so...

203
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,390
...once they fall into it, they'll be dead!

204
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,020
I don't deserve this!

205
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,990
I don't wanna go to level 4!

206
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,200
Oh no! We're gonna fall straight
into the Pool of Blood!

207
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,780
I'm falling!

208
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,940
Warden Magellan! An update!

209
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,260
The invader--Straw Hat Luffy
- is already on this floor!

210
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,160
What?! What do you mean by that?!

211
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,980
It seems like he fell into the well!

212
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,710
There's the Pool of Blood underneath!

213
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,320
How are they still alive?!

214
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,670
I think the giant piece of the floor
that they were on enabled them...

215
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,160
...to avoid falling into the pool.

216
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,250
How lucky they are!

217
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,250
--There's another thing!
--What?!

218
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,140
Warden, it stinks!

219
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,000
I mean, wow, this situation really stinks!

220
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,220
Minotaurus the demon guard fell into
the well also and he's not moving!

221
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,640
No way! They defeated him?!

222
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,900
I think so.

223
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,320
That can't be true! I can't believe it!

224
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,520
Calm down!

225
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,150
Follow these orders!

226
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,880
There are only two ways
to get out from level 4 -

227
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,170
two staircases that they can take without
authorization by security guards.

228
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,720
Split our forces here into three.

229
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,970
Hannyabal, you take this staircase
which leads to level 3!

230
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,010
Sadie-chan, you defend the stairway
to level 5 with the demon guards!

231
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,230
No, I don't wanna defend...

232
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,130
I wanna attack!

233
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,180
Being on the attack
is my true calling, Warden!

234
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,890
I'll let them get away and
lay the blame on Warden!

235
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,020
Do you have any objections?

236
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,080
Please stop... sighing!

237
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,380
I didn't complain!

238
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,780
I can feel your evil intentions towards me!

239
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,590
Once you catch them, you can
do whatever you want to them!

240
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,670
Yes! That sounds irresistible!

241
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,380
All the rest of you, just go after them!

242
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,270
I don't care if they're dead or alive!

243
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,320
Yes, sir!

244
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,930
"Almost dead" would do for me!

245
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,970
I won't let Straw Hat Luffy and
the others toy with me any longer!

246
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,780
They'll meet their doom
in this Burning Heat Hell!

247
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,270
But first...

248
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,580
The Warden is finally going to make his move!

249
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,460
You have to take another dump?!

250
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,800
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow... It's
insanely hot in this passage!

251
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:58,260
NEAR THE "POOL OF BLOOD"

252
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,390
Even my lungs are burning!

253
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,660
Hurry! I wanna get through this level!

254
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,710
Which way should we go?!

255
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,970
You guys are so pathetic!

256
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,740
If you just keep your cool, the fire
is like your queer little friend!

257
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,160
But I know how you feel!

258
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,520
This floor is a little bit
hotter than the upper level!

259
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,820
Oh? Yeah, it's a little too hot!

260
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,490
Hmmm... I can feel that my body's burning!

261
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,160
Oh? Ouch!

262
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,290
We can't handle any more of that!

263
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,750
It's that way! Let's go!

264
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,590
H-Hey! Where're you going?!

265
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,130
--It's too hot!
--Shut up!

266
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,620
Hmm... What must be there that
Straw-chan's running towards?

267
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,680
BON-CHAN'S ROUGH MAP OF LEVEL 4

268
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,740
It's the kitchen!

269
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm hungry, too! Wait for me, Straw-chan!

270
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,820
Wow! That'd be nice!

271
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,910
It'll be even better if
they have drinks, too!

272
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,820
Wait a minute, Buggy!

273
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,870
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

274
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,590
Smells good...

275
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,600
Ouch, ouch... Smells good...

276
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,540
There he is!

277
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,500
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

278
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,630
Oh! There are a lot of them!

279
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,760
This floor is really hot but once I
eat, I'll be filled with energy again!

280
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,260
Stop!

281
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,730
Gum-Gum...

282
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,720
...Fireworks!

283
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,410
We found Straw Hat Luffy!

284
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,870
Team A is fighting against him right now!

285
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,630
Team B has arrived on the scene!

286
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,380
They're closing in on him
together with Team A!

287
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,880
But they've taken heavy casualties!

288
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,480
They're requesting backup! What shall we do?!

289
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,810
Gum-Gum...

290
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,390
...Whip!

291
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,310
Spin, spin! I'm spinning!

292
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,160
"Oh Come My Way" Kenpo -
Memoirs of a Summer's Day!

293
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,330
--Team A and B have been wiped out!
--C, D, and E have major losses!

294
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,490
Backup from upstairs won't do!

295
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,280
We can't compete with them!

296
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,840
We can't hold that
position any longer!

297
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,280
The position that I worked
so hard to gain is at risk!

298
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,100
What's up, partner?!

299
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,160
Take a good look!

300
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,660
There is a sea of guards down there!

301
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:19,380
And level 4 is about screams and cries but
there's not a single guard at the fire torture pit!

302
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,430
Let's go! It's up there!

303
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,470
We ought to check the staircases right away!

304
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,690
Maybe they ambushed us and
boxed us in on this floor!

305
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,940
If they've been waiting on level 4,
that means they only want Straw Hat!

306
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,570
Because we only came here by accident!

307
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,950
They all know our names and
faces as escapees anyway!

308
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:55,660
What I am concerned about is
that it is very likely that...

309
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,630
...they have the all-stars of Impel Down
on this floor to put an end to this fuss!

310
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,260
That means, on top of the
three other demon guards,

311
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,760
Warden Magellan might be here, too!

312
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,560
Then, we're through!

313
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,060
Get out of my way!

314
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,560
Stop!

315
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,110
Don't stand in my way!

316
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,960
Oh, that scared me!

317
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,450
I thought that it was a spear or something!

318
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,720
W-What's this?

319
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,670
Ow, ow, ouch! Is it jelly?! Or crap?!

320
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,190
Straw-chan, look up!

321
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,310
I've had enough of you running
around and playing by your rules!

322
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,980
Who're you?!

323
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,070
M-Magellan!

324
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,640
You're dead, you vermin!

325
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,540
Warden Magellan has finally
made his appearance!

326
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,630
The power of the Venom-Venom
Fruit makes him untouchable,

327
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,120
but Luffy risks it all to take him on.

328
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,720
However, faced with the might of
the Hydra produced by Magellan,

329
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,260
Bon Clay makes a surprising move!

330
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,890
On the next episode of One Piece!

331
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,810
"Mighty Magellan! Bon Clay Bugs Out!"

332
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
