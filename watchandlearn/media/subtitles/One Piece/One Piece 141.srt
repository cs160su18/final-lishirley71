00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,430
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,730
Pumpkin Pirates, charge!

20
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,860
The treasure we're after is on that island!

21
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,150
Whoever makes land first gets a reward!

22
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,660
W-Wait!

23
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,910
Wait for me! I'm coming, too!

24
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,210
You can't.

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,010
After all, you're a grown-up, aren't you?

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Wait for me!

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,650
Rapa Nui! Isoka! Rongo! Akibi! Pukau!

28
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,050
Don't leave me here!
Don't leave me all by myself!

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,030
I was dreaming...

30
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,100
You're concerned about your friends, huh?

31
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,530
You were calling out
their names in your sleep.

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,640
What was it all for, exactly?

33
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,620
These last 50 years that I dedicated
to researching the Rainbow Mist?

34
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,700
Seeing Rapa Nui and the others
the way they were back then,

35
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,750
it makes me think that I, at least,
have wasted all that time.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,320
It wasn't wasted, right? You did get
to see all your old friends again.

37
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm not so sure...

38
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,260
Is the ship moving?

39
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,610
It shouldn't be...

40
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,210
"Thoughts of Home!
The Pirate Graveyard of No Escape!"

41
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,010
Forward!

42
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,230
Full speed ahead!

43
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,860
Hey, Luffy, are you sure
we're moving forward?

44
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,450
Yeah! Straight ahead!

45
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,020
Where on earth are you headed?

46
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,910
Where? We're going out of the mist!

47
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,910
Don't be ridiculous.

48
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,280
Once you wander into Ape's Concert,
you never get out of it again.

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,110
It's a fiendish region of the sea.

50
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,890
Hey, didn't we see that
ship a little while ago?

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,690
Don't let it bother you.

52
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,970
There are ships that look
alike everywhere you go.

53
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,010
No, this ship ran aground in the
very first place we dropped anchor.

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,890
I remember seeing the goddess on the bow.

55
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,530
D-Does that mean we've come
back to where we started from?

56
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,610
This is why I asked if you
were sure we're going forward!

57
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,750
I've been watching!
We've been going straight.

58
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,210
You can't see our way
straight in this mist, can you?

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,930
It can't be...

60
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,640
Seis Fleurs!

61
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,350
Hey, what was that for?!

62
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,640
We shot forward, but it came
flying in from behind us!

63
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,170
Sure enough.

64
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,370
Space is being distorted.

65
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,900
What do you mean?

66
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,960
I remembered something
written in the book.

67
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,570
The inside of the
Rainbow Mist is like a maze.

68
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,170
Gum-Gum...

69
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,730
H-Hey, don't do anything crazy!

70
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,200
...Rocket!!

71
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,760
Too late.

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,470
He won't necessarily return
to the same location.

73
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,180
That idiot!

74
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,330
I get it. This is a strange mist,
where no matter how far you go,

75
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,510
you end up where you started.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,400
Oh, it's a "strange mist."

77
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,160
Are you sure you understand?

78
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,030
The part about not being able
to get out of here, at least.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,200
We don't have to get out. It's fun in here!

80
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,860
Yes, we do!

81
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,830
Let's join up with Rapa Nui and the others.

82
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,100
With those kids?

83
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,680
The best way to get ourselves
out of Ape's Concert

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,020
is to consult the ones
whose territory it is, right?

85
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, but where are they?

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,940
Let's ask that boy over there.

87
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,960
How did she find me?!

88
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,480
It's no use hiding.

89
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,020
Un Fleur.

90
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,510
Would you take us?

91
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,390
To wherever your boss is?

92
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,160
Impossible!

93
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,800
Henzo came back,
and he's an old man, you say?

94
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
What sort of joke is that?

95
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,260
It's no joke.

96
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,960
He fell into the sea, in order to save us,
and we haven't seen him since.

97
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,970
I promise, I'll come after you later!

98
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,510
Go on! Keep going! Don't worry about me!

99
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,140
He's still alive, in the outside world.

100
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,010
Henzo said that he's been
looking for a way to bring us back,

101
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,530
all this time, in Luluka, and that
50 years had passed, just like that!

102
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,290
50 years? That's absurd.

103
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,670
Are you sure that old man
isn't playing a trick on you?

104
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,940
Why would he play a trick on us?

105
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,730
I wouldn't know why.

106
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,760
But if what Henzo said is true,

107
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,660
I wonder what's happened
to the town of Luluka.

108
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,080
Dad... Mom...

109
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,100
There's no use in worrying about it.

110
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,350
You'll know if it's true or not once
you go back and see for yourself.

111
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,380
You know of a way to get back?

112
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,640
Of course I do. I'm the raiding captain
of the Wetton Pirates, Ian-sama!

113
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,650
Tell us the way to get back
to the town of Luluka!

114
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,660
Sure! Just bring the key!
If you let me out of here,

115
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,000
then I'll take charge of you,
and return you to your homes.

116
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,380
Oh, okay...

117
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,380
Rongo! Akibi!

118
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,550
Don't let him fool you.

119
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,960
Ian just wants to get out of there.

120
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,620
Saying that he knows a way to
the outside world is just a ruse.

121
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,570
Huh? A ruse?

122
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,100
You sure are a tough one, Isoka-chan.

123
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,970
I haven't forgotten all those
times you mistreated us.

124
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,510
Listen up, you tenderfoots!

125
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,820
Being on the seas means always
being side by side with danger!

126
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,960
If you want to survive, then follow the orders

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,530
of the Wetton Pirates'
raiding captain, Ian-sama!

128
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,670
It's amazing! That ship over
there is full of jewels, too!

129
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,880
All right, take it to the captain's quarters.

130
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,650
They also had all this food!

131
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,990
All right, take that to
the captain's quarters, too.

132
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,960
Sea serpent!

133
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,780
Help!

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,060
Help!

135
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,060
Don't run away, face it!

136
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,370
R-Rongo!

137
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,810
Rapa Nui!

138
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,890
Hold it!

139
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,910
Take this!

140
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,390
What are you looking at me like that for?!

141
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,550
Looking at your gloomy faces
is making the food taste bad!

142
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,480
Remember, it's only because I
happened to be aboard this ship

143
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,130
that you've managed to stay alive up to now!

144
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,240
You might at least say thank you,

145
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
but I don't recall ever getting
looks as critical as this!

146
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,780
What's that?!

147
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,850
He was drawn here by the
smell of the food, was he?!

148
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,000
Guys, get outside!

149
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,710
Whoa, wait! This is my ship! Defend the ship!

150
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,270
Your boat is more important
than everyone's lives?!

151
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,760
We don't need a leader like that!

152
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,020
Damn it! My ship...!

153
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,830
We're better off without that ship.

154
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,940
Our true departure is just getting started.

155
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,030
We're all fed up with you,
always shooting your mouth off,

156
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,500
and only thinking about yourself!

157
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,720
I guess you must hate me.

158
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,040
But what if I really do know a way out of here?

159
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,470
Another transparent lie!

160
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,040
Go ahead and test me, to see if I'm lying.

161
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,560
You're concerned about the town
of Luluka, too, aren't you?

162
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
Once we get all of the dormant
treasures of Ape's Concert together,

163
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,650
we can live without doing
anything until the day we die!

164
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,660
We don't have to live as pirates
here in this hazy mist.

165
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,980
Well? Come with me,
back to the outside world.

166
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,370
Our only leader is Rapa Nui.
None of us are going to follow you.

167
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,330
My, my, there's no making headway with you.

168
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,840
Well, take your time and
think it over, Isoka-chan.

169
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,210
What's going on?!

170
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,460
There's a ship coming!

171
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,410
All hands, prepare for combat!
Fortify our defenses!

172
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,750
How did they know where we are?

173
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,550
Is that...?!

174
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,720
Pukau!

175
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,350
That ship is huge!

176
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,300
That's a wrecked warship, right?

177
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,660
Yeah. Right now, though, it's our hideout.

178
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,710
You cowards!

179
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,010
How dare you hold Pukau?!

180
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,130
What are you talking about?

181
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,110
No more talk!

182
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,740
Release Pukau!

183
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,760
Mayor! It's the Talielisin!

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,520
Oh, my dear old ship.

185
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,270
But Grandpa, why is this ship
coming back home now?

186
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,740
Yow!

187
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,920
I told you to call me "Mayor"!

188
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,750
Yes, sir.

189
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,940
Look there.

190
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,590
50 years ago, my ship
disappeared inside that mist.

191
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,260
And, since the ship has returned,

192
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,850
it means that the doorway to
Ape's Concert has been opened.

193
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,560
In other words, it's now or never,

194
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,180
if we want to get the
treasure inside there, right?

195
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,900
That's right. But how do you know that?

196
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,570
Well, your grandson there told me so.

197
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,240
You bonehead!

198
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,240
And after everything I said
about the treasure being a secret!

199
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,120
I'm sorry, Grandp-- I mean, Mayor.

200
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,790
It sure must be trouble, having
dimwitted family members, huh?

201
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,080
Mm-hmm.

202
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,520
Ain't that the truth? And why are
you acting sympathetic toward me?!

203
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,920
For whatever reasons, now that you
know the secret of Ape's Concert,

204
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,200
I can't afford you leaving.

205
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,880
You're going to silence us, is that it?

206
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,330
No, you're going to pay the
"I found out the secret" tax

207
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,130
of ten million Berries.

208
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,940
Is this a joke?!

209
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,840
More to the point, that's too much!

210
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,360
More to the point, what kind of tax is that?!

211
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,710
Are you saying you can't pay the tax?

212
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,460
Tax collection squad!

213
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,730
You called, Mayor Wetton?

214
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,020
Oh, Daddy!

215
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,560
Daddy?

216
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,490
Take them to Rainbow Tower,
and condemn them to hard labor.

217
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,170
What's that?

218
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,890
That is Rainbow Tower.

219
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,720
You are going to keep working
at that tower until you die.

220
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,560
Hellish, heavy labor, from morning until night.

221
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,180
You'll be off to the next world in no time.

222
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,300
Go on, Flip, take them away.

223
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,400
Oh, the Rainbow Mist has
appeared, hasn't it, Father?!

224
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,720
Now is our chance to get the
treasure from Ape's Concert!

225
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,040
He just said everything.

226
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,730
Secrets aren't worth a damn to them, are they?

227
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,100
All three generations are patently stupid.

228
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,920
You bonehead! Fine!

229
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Call in Henzo, and have him
investigate the Rainbow Mist!

230
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,260
Right! Bring me the transponder snail, at once!

231
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,260
Father, you're still pretty strong, huh?

232
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,900
Yes, sir!

233
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,600
Hey, calm down a minute!

234
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,220
Shut up! You took Pukau hostage,

235
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,790
and forced him to tell you
where our base is, didn't you?!

236
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,310
That would be disgraceful.

237
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,990
Rapa Nui, I'm not a hostage!

238
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,360
They just asked me to lead
them here, so I brought them!

239
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
They threatened you, to make you say that!

240
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,430
It's the truth! These people
aren't bad, I tell you!

241
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,910
Look, he doesn't get mad, even when I do this!

242
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,880
It's not true! This is all a strategy,
to get us to let our guards down!

243
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,380
You misunderstand.

244
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,820
We just want to know how
to get out of Ape's Concert.

245
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,360
And once you find out?

246
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,260
You're planning to take all the
treasures out of these shipwrecks,

247
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,440
and run off with them!

248
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,510
Believe me, Rapa Nui, these guys,
at least, wouldn't do that.

249
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,260
How can I believe the words of a grown-up?!

250
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,530
Of course they're out to get the treasure!

251
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,570
This is going nowhere.

252
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,880
Hey!

253
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,610
Look! Usopp's specially made lunch is ready!

254
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,870
Yahoo! Food!

255
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,320
You guys want some, too?

256
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,190
Can we?

257
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,080
I can't vouch for the taste, though.

258
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,320
Who asked you?

259
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,010
Yum! Did you really make this?

260
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,940
There's nothing I can't do. Hey, Luffy!
Don't eat those all yourself!

261
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,890
They're not as good as Sanji's,
but they are just regular yummy.

262
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,760
Oh, thanks. I lived alone for a long time and all.

263
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,040
There are some children over there
who look like they'd like some.

264
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,890
Hey, come on down, guys!

265
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,520
These are delicious!

266
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,850
Oh, can we really?

267
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,990
All right!

268
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,730
Don't let them sucker you in with food!

269
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,430
Have you forgotten your
pride as Pumpkin Pirates?!

270
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,750
Rapa Nui!

271
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,990
Pride won't fill your belly.

272
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,230
Huh? You guys came from the East Blue?

273
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,700
Yeah.

274
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,400
Which means, you must have
gone past Reverse Mountain, huh?

275
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,980
You've got guts!

276
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,510
Yes, we've gone through
many adventures up to now.

277
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,510
We've dueled with giants, and sea
serpents that swallow whole islands,

278
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,330
and even saved a country
from a secret society.

279
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,980
Wow, really?

280
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,920
Incredible!

281
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,520
The only reason we got
through those predicaments

282
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,770
is because we had my wisdom and bravery!

283
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,260
Out of reverence for that,
everyone calls me "Captain--"

284
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,530
What was that for?!

285
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,690
Stop sputtering when others are eating.

286
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,030
Rapa Nui, forgive me!

287
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,350
Forgive my shameful self! I spent
50 years researching a way

288
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,120
to save you from the Rainbow Mist,

289
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,360
I've finally managed to get
myself inside the mist,

290
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,370
but thanks to my carelessness,
we can't get out.

291
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,520
I'm a failure as a pirate professor!

292
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,900
But I will endure my shame to ask you,

293
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,860
if you know a way, please tell me!
How do we get out of this mist?

294
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,110
And then, we can leave here,
together, and go back to our home.

295
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,700
There is no way out.

296
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,700
And even if I did know of one,
I wouldn't tell you.

297
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,540
I still don't trust you guys, after all.

298
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
And you call yourselves friends?

299
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,150
What?!

300
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,220
Never mind us, Pops here
is your friend, isn't he?

301
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,300
Tell me, if you can't trust
your friends, who can you trust?

302
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,670
You keep out of this!

303
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,810
You expect me to just believe that
50 years have suddenly gone by?

304
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,930
Believe it!

305
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,240
No matter how much time has
passed, or how different he looks,

306
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
if he's one of your friends, who fell
in under the same banner as you,

307
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,570
you should know each other!

308
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,420
The color of your flag may fade,
but friendship is forever, you know!

309
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,310
Oh, that's me.

310
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay, okay, I'm coming. Huh?

311
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,370
Yes, hello?

312
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,510
What good does it do for you to answer?!

313
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,370
Well, well, Professor Henzo?

314
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,860
Huh? Who are you?

315
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,750
Huh? Who is this?

316
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,430
Luffy, is that you?

317
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,790
Where are you?

318
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,190
You guys just took the ship on your own,

319
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,440
and put the rest of us in a big fix!

320
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,390
Huh? Is that you, Nami?

321
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,860
You're connected to Nami and the others?

322
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,960
--Nami?
--Hold on, if we can talk to her...

323
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,540
Are we connecting to the outside world?!

324
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
Flip?! Flip, are you there?!

325
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,930
Yes, this is Flip!

326
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
Professor Henzo, where are you?

327
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,190
I'm inside the Rainbow Mist.

328
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,150
What?!

329
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,980
The Rainbow...

330
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,540
...Mist?

331
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,890
Currently, we are unable to get out.

332
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm sorry, but could you come rescue us?

333
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,720
Someone's coming for us?!

334
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,830
We can go back to Luluka, right?!

335
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,410
Isn't that great, Rapa Nui?

336
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,100
There's no time. Tell Wetton to
equip the safety search gear

337
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,360
that I invented, and to come inside the mist.

338
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,170
Also--

339
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,720
What are you doing?!

340
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,080
That name you just said, Wetton,

341
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,430
is the same man who burned
down the town of Luluka, isn't it?!

342
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:35,040
Wait! I had to team up with that man,
in order to save all of you!

343
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,920
Now it's all clear. You are not
the Henzo that we know!

344
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,470
If you were one of the Pumpkin Pirates,

345
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,000
there's no way you'd become
one of Wetton's pawns!

346
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,660
Rapa Nui...

347
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,350
Don't call me by that name!

348
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,540
You traitor!

349
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,560
Hello? Hello?

350
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,900
My, my, so they really are
inside that mist, are they?

351
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,280
What do we do?

352
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,340
Isn't it obvious? We go inside the mist.

353
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,200
Just a minute!

354
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,620
I told you,

355
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,810
you aren't allowed to go into
Ape's Concert without my permission.

356
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,310
You keep acting on your own, and...

357
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,880
Say, where is that safety gear
that he mentioned earlier?

358
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,420
Oh, in here.

359
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,090
Thank you!

360
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,080
No, don't mention it.

361
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,360
What are you giving it to them for?!

362
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,930
Thank you!

363
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,180
You fools! Seize them, at once!

364
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,620
Yes, sir!

365
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,680
And here, I was about to make
a wisecrack about eloping.

366
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,040
Go, Nami!

367
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,520
Yeah! Leave Luffy and the others,
and the treasure, to me!

368
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,230
Nami-san!

369
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,780
What?!

370
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:17,540
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

371
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:27,570
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

372
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,490
There are days where I almost lose to myself

373
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:51,930
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

374
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,050
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

375
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:08,420
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

376
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:17,270
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

377
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,390
This unique moment...

378
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,310
Hey, guys!

379
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,030
Oh, it's you, Nami.

380
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,590
What do you mean, "oh, it's you"?!

381
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,280
And after I came all the way
here just to rescue you!

382
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,910
So, where's Luffy?

383
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,090
He's not here.

384
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,180
He's disappeared beyond the mist.

385
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,330
Huh? What do you mean?

386
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,410
On the next episode of One Piece!

387
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,950
"An Inevitable Melee!
Wetton's Schemes and the Rainbow Tower"

388
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,420
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
