2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,450
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,830
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,630
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,350
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,770
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,150
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,530
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,500
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,960
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,210
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,970
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,560
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,060
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,530
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,780
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,830
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,420
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,800
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,350
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,560
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,100
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,810
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,440
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,940
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,280
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,440
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,570
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,910
And spread your wings

32
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,290
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,620
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,670
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,090
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,470
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,180
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,770
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,250
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,020
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,420
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,670
Find it!

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,830
I left everything this world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,250
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,300
The Arctic Path is enshrouded by ice.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,230
After getting split up,
the Straw Hat Crew are attacked

51
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,060
by a group of bounty hunters
known as the Accino Family.

52
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,120
It's show time!

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,900
Love Throw!

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,740
The lady is flying into my chest!

55
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,150
Today is his birthday, so everyone
came to pick up a birthday present!

56
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,830
Was the flag the present?

57
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,250
Boo! Bad guess!

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,050
These are the presents.

59
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,840
You have a 80-million-Berry bounty, right?

60
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,300
Luffy and the men on Puzzle's ship

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,310
catch the second oldest son
in the Accino Family, Blend.

62
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,470
Ah, crap!

63
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,770
Luffy!

64
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,560
Luffy!

65
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,260
As for you ex-pirates!
You'd better prepare yourselves!

66
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,300
Puzzle-san?

67
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,250
Puzzle!

68
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,520
You still haven't caught them?
How is the Straw Hat's flag coming?

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,010
It should be here soon, Papa.
Please calm down.

70
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,270
Where am I?

71
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:02,180
Meanwhile, Nami and Franky got caught
by the Accino Family's third son, Hockera.

72
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Damn it!

73
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,040
I'll break your nose!

74
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,390
Scary!

75
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,370
Usopp, how dare you harm a lady?!

76
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,330
Hey! Are you turning against me?!

77
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,000
How dare you hurt my sweet honey, Arbell?!

78
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,420
Wait!

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,050
Hey, Arbell-chan!

80
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,680
Take this, you punk!

81
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,140
Eat this! Flame Star!

82
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,940
Whoa! Move!

83
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,190
Youch, that smarts! I whacked my head!

84
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,740
The great Usopp-sama
Headbutt worked! Just as planned!

85
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,330
Arbell-chan, are you all right?

86
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,200
Salchow...

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,590
Who're you?!

88
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,220
"Stifling to the Max!
The Twins' Magnetic Power Looms"

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,950
I'm freezing!

90
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,560
I heard you're the one
who saved me. Thank you!

91
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,080
How do you feel? Does it hurt?

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,060
It seems okay.

93
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,030
Hey! You've got some nerve,
making us serve you!

94
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,280
How dare you underestimate
the Phoenix Pirates?!

95
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,850
Say your prayers!

96
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,310
Are you sure about this?
My siblings won't keep quiet

97
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,040
if something happens to me.

98
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,310
Shut up! We're done taking garbage from you!

99
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,670
You've got spunk, brat!

100
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,240
You're a...! You're nothing more than a...!

101
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,050
Stop right there!

102
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,540
Puzzle-san?

103
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,440
Don't get the wrong idea. I didn't
capture him so we could get payback.

104
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,470
Huh?

105
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,110
I want to... cut a deal with you.

106
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,990
A deal?

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,810
Yeah. I want you to let them off the hook.

108
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,990
In exchange...

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,960
In exchange, you can have my head.

110
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,830
What?!

111
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,870
P-Puzzle-san, you're...?!

112
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,570
How could you say that?!

113
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,340
This is great! You're quite the captain!

114
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,510
If you do that, what'll happen
to the Phoenix Pirates?!

115
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,550
Jiro...

116
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,020
The captain has made up his mind.

117
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,210
But...!

118
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,560
Jiro!

119
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,520
I...

120
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,160
How dare you bastards try to trick us?!
I should teach you a lesson!

121
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,750
Stansen!

122
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,910
Captain, what are you doing?
Let that creep have it!

123
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,800
Go on, Captain!

124
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,220
Captain, why? Go back to
the way you used to be!

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,140
Please! Come back to us!

126
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,520
Damn it...!

127
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,650
We aren't pirates anymore!

128
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Puzzle-san...!

129
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,090
You've got a clever captain.

130
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,580
Very well. I'll spare your whole
crew in exchange for your head!

131
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,710
No! I... I'm a member of the Phoenix Pirates!

132
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,270
Hey!

133
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,380
I'm gonna take this jerk down!

134
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,260
Jiro, stop. It's all over...

135
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,470
Kid, I dare you to so much as touch me!

136
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,560
I'll get back at you and all of your crewmates!

137
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,520
Damn it!

138
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,190
Straw Hat...?

139
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,190
Weren't you listening, punk?
Hurt me and they'll all pay the--

140
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,260
Give back my flag.

141
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,530
Luffy...

142
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,310
Your flag?! Take a look around you.

143
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,900
Now isn't the time!

144
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,230
This has nothing to do with them.
Give back my Jolly Roger right now!

145
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,040
I-I don't have it right this second, so I can't!

146
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,130
Then take me to it!

147
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,800
C-Calm down! Someone is on
his way for me as we speak.

148
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,900
Your flag is in the Arctic Path's last stop,

149
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,800
my family's base of operations, Lovely Land!

150
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,420
But you're finished once you reach Lovely Land!

151
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,730
I'll send the whole lot of you to the
afterlife before you ever see that flag!

152
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,690
Isn't the flag here yet?

153
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,650
Campaccino!

154
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,620
Papa, Lil's kite is currently flying it over!
It will be here any second now!

155
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,800
And what happened to my birthday party?

156
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,040
It will resume as soon as everyone returns.

157
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,780
Campaccino, how long must I wait?!

158
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,180
P-Papa, don't get so upset!

159
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,550
We're almost to my house.

160
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,260
This person and this person are also

161
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,930
headed over to your house, right?

162
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,730
Yup!

163
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,270
My big brother, Hockera, is taking them!

164
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,180
I see...

165
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,460
Papa is going to love this!

166
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,140
Hey! Can't you do something about the cold?

167
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,990
I could have if I'd known we'd
get turned into popsicles!

168
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,780
I know! Wanna try melting the ice
from the inside with my Fresh Fire?

169
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,150
Don't even! What if you started a fire in here?!

170
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,520
Then what do you suggest?

171
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,940
I want you to come up with
something that isn't dangerous!

172
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,450
You're one picky chick!

173
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,680
You're not picky enough!

174
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,710
Dang, this doting couple is annoying!

175
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,650
Arbell-chan, what do you see in that monkey?

176
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,570
They really pulled a number
on us earlier, Arbell!

177
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,910
Salchow, now that it's come to this,
let's show them our ultimate move!

178
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,850
Hey! They're about to do something.

179
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,500
All right! I'd better show
Arbell-chan how cool I am.

180
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,910
Oh, crud! This looks bad!

181
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,090
They're spinning around a lot more than usual.

182
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,670
I will save Arbell-chan from that ugly man!

183
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,640
Okay! We'll go with that plan!

184
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,390
You're up!

185
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,450
We're looking really great! Arbell, here we go!

186
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,320
Right, Salchow!

187
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,990
Death Spiral High Jump Ultra Love Throw!

188
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,450
Whoops!

189
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Youch!

190
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,420
Damn it! I can't dig my heels
into the ground without slipping!

191
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,710
Sanji, I'm not confident I'll survive
if I get hit by that again.

192
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,630
I swear, you always make such
a big deal out of everything!

193
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,190
This is clearly a fatal injury! Isn't it obvious?!

194
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,560
Salchow, we're the best!

195
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,570
We're looking really great, Arbell!
Let's give it another go!

196
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,060
Yeah!

197
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,610
Usopp.

198
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,150
It's time we hit them with
a combo attack of our own.

199
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,810
What is it? Did you come up with a sweet idea?!

200
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,170
Hey! What's with this situation?!

201
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,320
Now I won't slip!

202
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,530
Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow! That hurts!

203
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,840
Collier Frit!

204
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,830
Nice!

205
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,870
Arbell-chan...

206
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,130
Did I earn a high score for artistry this time?

207
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,880
Shut up, you wanted man!

208
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,840
Get off of me already!

209
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,280
Salchow! Hang in there, Salchow!

210
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,820
Ar-Arbell...

211
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,940
Have you learned your lesson?
Your measly attacks will never work on us!

212
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,790
Ar-Arbell-chan...

213
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
Sanji, how long are you gonna lay there? Get up!

214
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,280
If you're gonna give up, now is your chance.

215
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,660
I still haven't hit you with
a full 10% of my power.

216
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,030
Did you think we were randomly
skating on top of the ice?

217
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,250
Eh? Huh? What? What do you mean by that?

218
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,530
This is what we mean!

219
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,810
C-C-Cold!

220
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,800
Surrender now!

221
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,700
What?!

222
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,520
Let us catch you and we'd be willing
to save you. If you don't hurry...

223
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,370
Wh-What're those?

224
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,360
Ouch!

225
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,610
You'll die from hypothermia
if you don't surrender soon.

226
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,460
Sh-Sh-Shuddup! Hey, Sanji! Wake up!

227
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,530
Ushopp, I'm sharting to get sweepy...

228
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,250
Stupid! That's really bad!

229
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,880
I'm sweepy...

230
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,860
Fine! Fine! Just save us!

231
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,720
Look, Salchow! I caught something!

232
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,020
So did I, Arbell!

233
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,820
D-Damn it...!

234
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,580
Kissy-poo!

235
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,610
Hey, when is he gonna get here?

236
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,980
Click.

237
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,780
What's that?

238
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,980
Hey, kiddo! I've got a portable
transponder snail in my butt pocket.

239
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,130
Could you get it?

240
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,750
Blend, what's keeping you? You're late!

241
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,710
Papa is angry. Hurry back home.

242
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,990
Hey! Can you hear me, Blend?

243
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,170
Answer me!

244
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,880
The Phoenix Pirates have Blend!

245
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,140
If you mess with us, he's dead!

246
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,620
Jiro, you...!

247
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,180
I take back what I said!

248
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,940
What?!

249
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,610
Big Brother is coming.

250
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,110
Your brother?

251
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,070
You've taken your tough act too far!

252
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,030
You've just bought everyone
tickets to the afterlife!

253
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,010
What do you mean we're going to the afterlife?!

254
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,930
Wha--?!

255
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,910
I-I won't tolerate any funny business.

256
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,600
Hey, dude! Why'd you start glowing?

257
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,780
Wow! What's he doing?

258
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,220
Just wait and see!

259
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,960
What is that?

260
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,990
Huh? When'd you break free?

261
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,250
He's really fast!

262
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,200
That can't be right!

263
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,270
What's going on?
Did you use a clone technique?

264
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,020
How dare you capture my darling little brother?

265
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,990
Little Brother!

266
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,900
Big Brother!

267
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,810
It's been a while, but...

268
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,080
...let's show them our combination plays!

269
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,980
Awesome! How did you do that just now?!

270
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,870
We have the ability to manipulate magnetism!

271
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,500
We can pull ourselves together or apart at will!

272
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,010
And the magnetic powers that link us

273
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,700
can instantly separate us by the
distance of our measurable feelings.

274
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,180
Such is our...

275
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,110
...brotherly love!

276
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,530
Hey! Did you eat a Devil Fruit?

277
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,050
Why are we drawn to each other?

278
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,490
Because we are...

279
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,600
...twins!

280
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,450
Wow! Twins are awesome!

281
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,870
No, there is definitely
something fishy about them!

282
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,880
Blend, which one is our prey for today?

283
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,640
For starters, that guy is Puzzle the Phoenix.
He has a 100-million-Berry bounty.

284
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,230
And that is Straw Hat Luffy
with a 300-million-Berry bounty.

285
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,170
Oh, so that's him.

286
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,330
And that's his cotton-candy-loving pet,
Chopper. He's worth 50 Berries.

287
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:08,980
Fifty?!

288
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,410
What is with that 50-Berry bounty?

289
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,990
What indeed, Big Brother?

290
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,610
Don't say that! 50 Berries says a whole lot!

291
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,950
Whatever. Moving on.

292
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,630
Do you think you can
escape our combination plays?

293
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,360
Hey!

294
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,290
Straw Hat!

295
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,190
Look over here!

296
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,630
Don't, Luffy! Behind you!

297
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,090
Behind me?

298
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,170
Repulsion!

299
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,000
Did he fall into the ocean?

300
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,180
He was nothing before us brothers!

301
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,430
Luffy!

302
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,530
Gum-Gum...

303
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,290
...Rocket!

304
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,150
Big Brother!

305
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,550
Luffy!

306
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,580
Awesome!

307
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,820
Straw Hat...

308
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,830
Done already?

309
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,530
Campaccino!

310
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,390
What was that?

311
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,880
Is someone in here?

312
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,360
How long are you going to keep me waiting?

313
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,880
What happened to my birthday party?
Where's the flag?

314
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,480
Dang, it's hot in here! What's with this room?

315
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,800
Who're you?

316
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,060
What's this? You aren't Campaccino!

317
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,640
I have a special bottle I've been saving...
Would you like to join me?

318
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,230
What? Sure...

319
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,620
Hey, just make yourself at home!

320
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,580
Thanks!

321
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,850
The Family was sweet enough
to throw me a birthday party,

322
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,300
but then they took off mid-party
and haven't come back!

323
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,200
Yeah? Talk about a coincidence!

324
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,130
My friends vanished before I knew it.
I'm still looking for them.

325
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,130
You too, eh?

326
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,590
Oh, thanks!

327
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,090
Who knows where they went
or what they're doing?!

328
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,090
Seriously! Where'd they decide to go goof off?

329
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,140
Gum-Gum...

330
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,200
...Bell!

331
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,730
Doctor!

332
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm fine!

333
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,770
Guys, if you don't give back our flag,
I'm gonna kick your butts for real!

334
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,870
Blend, Papa is getting hot with rage!
We need to finish this up fast.

335
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,050
He's a Devil Fruit power holder!

336
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,970
If we can drop him in the ocean, he's finished!

337
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,890
Gum-Gum...

338
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,870
...Gatling!

339
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,250
Leap!

340
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,870
Fusion!

341
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,990
Luffy!

342
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,510
Captain!

343
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,470
It's no good! He's too far!

344
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,330
There is no way I'm gonna fall in!

345
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,810
Magnetic Repulsion!

346
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,360
Phew, that was close!

347
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,210
Straw Hat!

348
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,240
You cannot hope to escape from us!

349
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,000
You really are persistent!

350
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,830
Gum-Gum... Twin Pistol!

351
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,080
Repulsion!

352
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
I'm on my way, Luffy!

353
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,640
Wh-What was that?

354
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,980
Jiro, look out!

355
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,190
Jiro!

356
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,170
Are you all right?

357
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,540
Captain...!

358
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,120
Hey, take the ship back! Please go after Luffy!

359
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,760
We can't do that!

360
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,590
You can't tell a ship where
to go here in the Arctic Path.

361
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,100
Luffy...

362
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,510
We should just ignore anyone
who doesn't come back!

363
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,600
Knowing them, I bet they're having fun
slipping and sliding on the ice. Sheesh!

364
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,990
Well? What do you think?
That collection is my pride and joy.

365
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,530
Your collection?

366
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,650
Right! They're the flags of all
the pirates I've hunted down.

367
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,450
Impressive, isn't it?

368
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,710
You've got a disgusting hobby.

369
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,670
Hey, don't be so harsh!

370
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,690
Oh, it's here! It's here!

371
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm sure you'll understand
once you feast your eyes on this.

372
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,750
Their total bounty exceeds 600 million Berries.

373
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,930
This Jolly Roger belongs to the Straw Hat Crew.

374
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:03,690
What do you think with your
120 million bounty, Roronoa Zoro?

375
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,650
Bastard...!

376
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,450
How the hell did you get that Jolly Roger?!

377
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,200
Wouldn't you agree it's
a rather nice Jolly Roger?

378
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,560
Jeez, it's cold!

379
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,210
So you're gonna lock us in here, huh?

380
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,550
All of the walls are made outta ice!

381
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,380
And it's so cold that I'm starting to get sleepy...

382
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,560
Don't fall asleep!

383
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,720
If you do, you'll turn into an ice cube!

384
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,140
Where did Robin and Zoro go?!

385
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

386
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,990
"A Mansion in Chaos! An Enraged
Don and an Imprisoned Crew"

387
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
