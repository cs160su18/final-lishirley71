00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,740
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,460
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,240
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,050
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,340
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,980
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,010
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

14
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,380
the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,530
an island with two parts,
one burning, the other frozen.

17
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,690
After learning about
the ruler of the island -

18
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,370
Caesar clown, aka the Master's motive,

19
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,790
and all while trying to escape Shinokuni, the weapon of mass destruction,

20
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,540
along with their pirate ally -

21
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,250
the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

22
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,420
they are on the move to kidnap Caesar,

23
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,920
save the children, and escape from the island.

24
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,920
Jet Spear!

25
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,260
The floor!

26
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,170
What tremendous hidden strength he has.

27
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,820
But falling through here

28
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,460
will land him in the slide to the
garbage dump deep underground.

29
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,140
He'll never be able to come
back up unless he can fly.

30
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,120
I didn't expect him to
sabotage himself like that.

31
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,740
Goodbye!

32
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,830
It didn't work!

33
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,660
I was pretty sure that I could
take my heart back from Caesar.

34
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,420
But I didn't expect you here.

35
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,260
Vergo!

36
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,220
It's Vergo-san to you!

37
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,670
I'm in the middle of something.

38
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,450
Does it have to be now?

39
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,280
Vice Admiral Smoker.

40
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,000
"Fists Collide!
A Battle of the Two Vice Admirals!"

41
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,970
B BUILDING 3RD FLOOR - BISCUIT ROOM

42
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,480
Mocha, those sweet candies
are for everybody, aren't they?

43
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,230
Stop fighting.

44
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,190
Share and eat them together as usual.

45
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,280
No!

46
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,570
We shouldn't eat them anymore!

47
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,820
You're a difficult girl.

48
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,410
Hey, what have you done?!

49
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,120
Yeah, we don't have any time for you!

50
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,530
How could you say such a thing?

51
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,670
I know about you people so well.

52
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,010
The infamous Straw Hats.

53
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm happy to see you.

54
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,680
Who the hell are you?!

55
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,550
I'm Monet, a Snow-Snow Fruit eater.

56
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,690
Usopp! Brook!

57
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,830
I'll try to restrain the children here!

58
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,450
You two, go find some
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs!

59
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs?!

60
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,570
Why?

61
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,120
Luffy asked me to find them!

62
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,260
I don't know why but...

63
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,670
You can count on me to find things!

64
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,530
I'll come with you!

65
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,050
I have to find Momonosuke!

66
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,000
All right! Let's go!

67
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,940
D BUILDING - THE "SAD" MANUFACTURING ROOM

68
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,000
What are those?

69
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,670
This room's really disturbing.

70
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,760
That's none of your business.

71
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,970
Hey, why are you looking away?

72
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,150
I haven't given up yet.

73
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,660
I'll take care of you later.

74
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,280
Why don't you just shut up
and grovel on the ground?

75
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,420
Vergo.

76
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,700
I don't want the soldiers
to know the truth about you.

77
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,130
They admire you like a father.

78
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,830
It's a serious breach of trust.

79
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,550
I can't believe

80
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,600
you're Joker's dog.

81
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,350
It's too late.

82
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,480
I just saw them a few minutes ago.

83
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,980
What did you do to them?!

84
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,360
I don't remember.

85
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,690
Vergo!

86
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,220
You're heating up, Smoker-kun.

87
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,860
Don't tell me

88
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,290
you're worrying about
those Navy misfits.

89
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,050
I'm a base commander.

90
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,340
I can do whatever I want
to my good-for-nothing subordinates.

91
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,180
Plus, you're gonna have to die anyway

92
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,560
since you know
who I really am now.

93
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,670
Even if you've known them for a long time

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,710
and even if you're a base commander

95
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,190
which I don't acknowledge now,

96
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,470
once we're out of the base,

97
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,460
an unit commander is
responsible for the troops' life.

98
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,980
Don't lay a hand

99
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,850
on my men!

100
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,820
B BUILDING - THE G-5 AND SANJI

101
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,910
What's going on here?

102
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,450
Ouch! Ow! Ow!

103
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,040
There is no place to step!

104
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,460
What happened here?!

105
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,650
Hurry up!

106
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,420
Carry the injured and let's go!

107
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,920
We gotta protect Tashigi-chan!

108
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,090
Stop it!

109
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,530
Don't be so friendly!

110
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,920
He's our enemy!

111
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,220
That's just how people would
define our relationship!

112
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,180
But pirates are free!

113
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,500
When you gave the Vergo
impostor a blow, brother,

114
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,990
you looked so cool -
even I could fall in love!

115
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,100
Yeah, you looked so hot, brother!

116
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,320
Shut up!

117
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,970
I said I don't need support from guys!

118
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,690
Stop calling a pirate "brother"!

119
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,970
The tank exploded!

120
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,490
It caught fire!

121
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,440
Hey,

122
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,650
that's not good!

123
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,180
There is a crack on the outer wall!

124
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,210
Another explosion!

125
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,710
What the hell!

126
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,380
Run, guys!

127
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,400
Huh? What's wrong?

128
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,800
You look pale.

129
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,550
The gas is flowing in from the outside!

130
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,910
The deadly gas from earlier!

131
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,780
What?!

132
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,010
Run if you don't wanna die!

133
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,440
No!

134
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,730
This B Building is very big

135
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,740
but it'll be filled up
with the gas in no time!

136
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,500
Stand up already!

137
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,380
Tashigi-chan, you have to lead them!

138
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
If you lose your way, you'll die!

139
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,550
Don't go the wrong way!

140
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,910
Black Foot!

141
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,240
Come on, guys!

142
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,470
You're gonna die
if you're too slow!

143
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,930
Everybody! This way!

144
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,890
R BUILDING 2ND FLOOR - THE SECRET ROOM

145
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,930
They're so dumb!

146
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,880
They let Shinokuni in themselves!

147
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,050
But...

148
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,820
...letting them die there won't help

149
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,990
bring my experiment show to completion!

150
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,280
Hey, close the gates to Building C and D!

151
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,050
Yes, sir. What about the one to R?

152
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,620
Keep that one open.

153
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,920
I want to lure them into
the first floor of R Building.

154
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,350
They're trying to get to R Building -
gate 66 anyway.

155
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,600
I don't want them to take
an unnecessary side trip

156
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,980
so let's just guide them!

157
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,560
C BUILDING - A GARBAGE DUMP

158
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,990
That was awful.

159
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,190
Where am I?

160
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,320
It's broken.

161
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,090
So is this a garbage dump?

162
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,090
I guess I fell all the way down
to the deep underground.

163
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm hungry!

164
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,050
Come to think of it,
I had been running for so long!

165
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,580
Isn't there something to eat?

166
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,860
Damn!

167
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,750
It's all garbage!

168
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,170
Be careful, you insolent fellow!

169
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,580
I really don't like this room!

170
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,800
The "secret room" on the
second floor of R Building.

171
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,120
I didn't wanna come
to this shitty room.

172
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,900
But I can't let the Straw Hats
do whatever they like.

173
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,480
They pushed it a little too far.

174
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,310
I've got Joker on my back.

175
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,180
Once they come this far,
I'll kill them all perfectly!

176
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,030
Master!

177
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,930
We have been ready
to fight since yesterday!

178
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,830
So why did you summon us here

179
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,210
to the former office of
that despicable Vegapunk?

180
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,240
Vegapunk is also an enemy to us

181
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
since he caused the
accident four years ago!

182
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,820
Isn't there anything we can do?!

183
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,950
Shouldn't we fight them?!

184
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,080
No, you shouldn't.

185
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,720
You people are the best soldiers I have!

186
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,500
I don't want you to shed
your blood for nothing!

187
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,090
M-Master...

188
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,430
All right. Let me
explain about the plan.

189
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,970
When we close the gates
to C and D as I said before,

190
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,820
the only open paths left

191
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,560
are the ones connected

192
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,440
to the first floor of R Building
which is below this room.

193
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,680
The Straw Hats, the G-5, or the children.

194
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,330
Doesn't matter if they're our enemies or not,

195
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,200
the only place those survivors can get to
is going to be the room below.

196
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,670
There are some air vents on
the first floor of R Building.

197
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,150
So we can let the air from outside -
that is to say, Shinokuni - flow in.

198
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,420
And then there is no turning back.

199
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,690
Who can survive that?!

200
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,370
When we close all the gates,

201
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,220
it will become a big gas chamber!

202
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,880
We're gonna broadcast
what's going on in that room

203
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
for all the underground
brokers in the New World!

204
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,110
So they will see
what I'm capable of!

205
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,860
P-Pardon me for asking this,
Master Caesar.

206
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,330
Did you create that deadly poison gas?

207
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,920
Yes, I did.

208
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,000
It's like Vegapunk's poison gas

209
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,810
that spread all over the island
after the accident four years ago.

210
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,440
So it freaks us out, to be honest.

211
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,170
It's horrible.

212
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,760
Master?

213
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,220
This is...

214
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,260
...an avenging battle of science!

215
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,960
My people!

216
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,600
That day,

217
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,670
I tried to stop...

218
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,100
...the mad scientist -

219
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,190
Vegapunk!

220
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,900
"No! If such a weapon explodes,

221
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,450
what's gonna happen to
the people on the island?!"

222
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,080
"Stop it, Vegapunk!"

223
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,380
But the accident happened.

224
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,840
On top of that, he still lords over us

225
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,570
as the head of the science
department of the Navy!

226
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,680
And he's considered the
world's greatest scientist!

227
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,220
I can't tolerate it!

228
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,350
He's the cruel man who hurt you all!

229
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,900
Do you think it's right that people
still call him the No.1 scientist?!

230
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,830
Master!

231
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,820
That's why I want to prove them wrong!

232
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,830
I didn't want to make a
weapon of mass destruction

233
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,160
but I want to show them
that there is a greater scientist here!

234
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,980
That I am the greatest
scientist in the world!

235
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,130
When the Navy acknowledges it

236
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,760
and when I become the top
of the science department,

237
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,510
my dream will come true.

238
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,180
I can use my scientific knowledge
to bring peace to the world!

239
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,560
Master!

240
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,250
I'm sorry, Master! We should
be ashamed for suspecting you!

241
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,320
You're the savior after all!

242
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,320
Master!

243
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,000
Master!

244
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,250
Master!

245
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,540
Master!

246
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,740
Thank you! Thank you all!

247
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,300
Stop it, Caesar!

248
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,350
You have to abort the experiment now!

249
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,970
If such a weapon explodes,

250
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,760
what's gonna happen to
the people on the island?!

251
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,940
Shut up, you boneheads!

252
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,980
Where do you think you are?

253
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,640
This is the Navy's research facility!

254
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,320
The Navy wants to kill as
many pirates as they can

255
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,620
and what they need is a
weapon that will do it for them!

256
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,060
That's not true!

257
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,590
They don't want a weapon
that would also kill civilians!

258
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,090
You're so dumb!

259
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,340
It's called collateral damage!

260
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,190
Those who get themselves
involved must be stupid!

261
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,720
If we blow away everything,

262
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,100
we can bring peace to the world.

263
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,900
You're so...

264
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,600
You want to say I'm cruel?

265
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,060
You've got to be kidding me!

266
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,890
You're using the damn prisoners

267
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,800
as your guinea pigs
as if they're real trash!

268
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,610
What's the difference?

269
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,990
The incumbent fleet admiral,
Sengoku, is too soft.

270
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,830
But Admiral Akainu would
want a weapon that I make.

271
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,910
If you finally get it, then go away!

272
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,210
You're disturbing me.

273
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,660
Vegapunk must be jealous of me
because I'm such a genius!

274
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,140
I heard he failed to turn
people into giants again.

275
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,040
You can't make people bigger in a
short period of time unless you use magic.

276
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,730
So I kept telling him:

277
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,540
He should just go kidnap some kids

278
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,020
who are still developing

279
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,820
and try every drug he can think of!

280
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,130
Caesar...

281
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,710
That's it! That's it!

282
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,190
Wh-What are you doing?!

283
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,670
Don't fight!

284
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,380
Do you think you can
talk to me like that?!

285
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,410
I'm almost finished making a weapon

286
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,720
that you guys have only dreamed of!

287
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,430
Vegapunk!
What's going on here?!

288
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,310
You're dismissed from the
science department, Caesar.

289
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,650
Your eccentric behavior is intolerable
and I can't protect you anymore.

290
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,280
Screw you!

291
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,990
Don't do it, Caesar!

292
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,950
Fools!

293
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,300
Vegapunk, the Navy, Straw Hat,
and these guys right here,

294
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,840
they're way less intelligent than me -

295
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,390
they're all dumb as a brick!

296
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,900
Now, let's do it!

297
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,780
The gate between C and B is closed!

298
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,570
The gate between D and B is closed!

299
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,970
No one can enter Building C and D
from B Building now!

300
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,870
Run like hell!

301
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,370
Did you just say something?

302
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,230
Who the hell are you?!

303
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,520
Wh...

304
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,650
Wh...

305
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,770
Who...

306
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,230
...are you?!

307
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,250
Deep within the depths of Building C,
which is said to be inescapable,

308
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,530
Luffy finds himself in a desperate situation
and is then greeted by a small dragon.

309
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,080
The dragon calls himself a warrior
and has overcome a strange fate.

310
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,390
Because of their chance meeting,
Luffy decides to take action.

311
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,740
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,500
"A Small Dragon!
Momonosuke Appears!"

313
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
