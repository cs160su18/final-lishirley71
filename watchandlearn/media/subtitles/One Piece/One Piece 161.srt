00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,410
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,170
Say... This ground...

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,150
It's dirt.

22
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,720
Eh? Oh, right!

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,110
Sky islands are made out of island cloud...

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,280
Why is this island different?

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,250
Looks like checking into it
might be worth a lot...

26
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,350
This is the Illusion Forest Ball Ordeal,
with a 10% survival rate!

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,500
You'd better hurry before the boat
goes deeper into the Illusion Forest!

28
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,970
Hey! We gotta go after the boat
before we lose sight of it!

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,220
I'm gonna take care of the ball guy!

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,550
Don't do anything reckless!
He's got some weird powers!

31
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,910
We'll come back once we stop the boat!

32
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,180
Right! Gum-Gum...

33
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,690
...Pistol!

34
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,950
Gum-Gum...

35
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,670
...Whip!

36
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,230
Again!

37
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,140
Dammit! Can't see from down here!

38
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,780
Watch yourself, Luffy!
These priests are no ordinary people!

39
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,290
Let's find the boat ASAP
and get the hell outta here!

40
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,830
"The Ordeal of Spheres!
Desperate Struggle in the Lost Forest"

41
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,110
Don't be in such a rush! Stay for a while!

42
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,710
Now then, where are the other two?
I won't let a single one escape!

43
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,980
Here we are!

44
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,390
Hey! You see it, Usopp?!

45
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,220
Found it!

46
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,380
Gimme directions!

47
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,160
Straight ahead! Climb up
the tree after the next one!

48
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,520
You can jump onto it from the branches!

49
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,470
Got it!

50
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,550
Yikes! It's him! What's he up to?!

51
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,850
Go!

52
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,850
Look out, Sanji! There's a ball headed your way!

53
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,020
What?! What's Luffy doing?!

54
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,610
Surprise Billiard!

55
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,200
Usopp!

56
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,130
He was aiming for me!

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,140
It's gonna explode!

58
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,930
"Pop"?!

59
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,140
A dud...

60
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,220
Idiot!

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,250
Why, you...!

62
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,690
Gum-Gum...

63
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,550
...Gatling!

64
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,110
Stop, Luffy! Don't hit those balls randomly!

65
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,280
What the--?! What the--?! What the--?!

66
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,930
Oh, no! Too late!

67
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,290
Look out! They're coming from all directions!

68
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,540
You people are fun!

69
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,510
Spears! Crab!

70
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,390
Four at once!

71
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,130
What the--? Another dud?
Or should I say, I hit the jackpot?

72
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,790
I freaked out for nothing!

73
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,830
Huh? You want me to sing, too?

74
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,270
Okay! Listen in awe to the one
known as the Singing Pirate!

75
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,240
Here goes!

76
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,660
Hey! I haven't sung yet!

77
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,850
Oww! Hot! Oww!

78
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,150
Water! Water! Water!

79
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,200
Oww! Hot! Oww! Oww!

80
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,320
River!

81
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,740
Oww!

82
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,560
I went through!

83
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,610
Luffy! Don't fall into the river below!
There might not be a bottom!

84
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,220
Eh?!

85
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,410
Yikes!

86
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,360
Are you stupid?!

87
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,310
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!
Usopp Hammer!

88
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,330
Rubber Band! Usopp Hammer!

89
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,650
Yahoo!

90
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,460
Yahoo!

91
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,450
Oh! I didn't think of that!
Now I can finally try it out!

92
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,190
Got any ideas, Usopp?!

93
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,690
I sure do! I'm known as
the greatest pirate inventor!

94
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,140
I'll show ya my latest weapon!

95
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,200
Usopp Aa-aa-aa!

96
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,250
Uhh, what?

97
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,910
Just watch!

98
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,410
There it is! On the river straight ahead!

99
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,840
I can make it! Set up!

100
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,000
What is he up to?

101
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,750
Alright! Now it's just a
straight line to the Crow!

102
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,500
If it goes any further in,
we won't be able to get it!

103
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,750
I can't let this chance go!

104
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,610
Wow, not too shabby! Watch out for the balls!

105
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,500
I ain't gonna screw up!
You can call me King of the Jungle!

106
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,930
Here goes!

107
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,890
Usopp Aa-aa-aa!

108
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,240
Here goes!

109
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,150
Usopp Aa-aa-aa!

110
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,420
Alright! Go!

111
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,950
Yes! Perfect! Get on board and stop the boat!

112
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,490
What're you doing?! Get on already!

113
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,920
Yeah... about that...

114
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:55,910
I forgot that the rope is attached
to the belt, so I can't get down...!

115
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,820
Crap! Crap! Crap!

116
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,110
Yahoo! Hey, Usopp!
You seem to be havin' fun, too!

117
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,950
I need a word with you two.

118
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,810
Got it? I'll forget what just
happened, so do as I say!

119
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,760
Yes! I'm sorry!

120
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,570
I'm sorry...

121
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,740
Forget about the boat for right now.

122
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,270
All three of us are gonna attack him at once!

123
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,260
I don't care if he is a priest;
if we all attack at once,

124
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,300
we should be able to find a way to beat him!

125
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,260
Beat me?!

126
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,510
Where'd he go?!

127
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,890
Impact!

128
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,680
Sanji!

129
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,780
Life is suffering...

130
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,460
Now, for the other two!

131
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,650
Thanks!

132
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,010
Hey, did something move over there?

133
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,080
Dunno.

134
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,460
Say, did you see anything, Robin?

135
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,470
No, nothing at all...

136
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,090
You sure it wasn't just a monkey?

137
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,450
A monkey? I guess so...

138
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,390
Say. Do you think we should
check out the other shore after all?

139
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,100
No way! What if we get
attacked by sharks again?!

140
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,320
Geez! You're hopeless...

141
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,640
I can't get near it like this...

142
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,610
I promised Zoro I would fix the ship...

143
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,660
Alright! I'll do my best, too!

144
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,370
Just don't let them notice you!
Gently... Gently...

145
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,610
Gently... Gently...

146
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,190
I did it! Now I can fix the ship!

147
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,660
The whistle...!

148
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,820
One blow of this One Whistle...

149
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,780
...and I shall come to your aid!

150
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,140
Normally, I charge five million Extol,

151
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,980
but I will give you the
One Whistle as a present!

152
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,880
Wait! We still don't know your name!

153
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,200
I am Gan Fall, the Sky Knight!
And this is my partner, Pierre!

154
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,290
May luck be with you, warriors!

155
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,750
So how do we get up there?

156
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,250
I know! Let's call that old man and ask!

157
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,540
H-H-Hold on, Luffy! This is only
supposed to be used in emergencies!

158
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,060
What if that weird masked
guy shows up again?!

159
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,790
Here! I'll hold on to this whistle!

160
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,760
Any objections?!

161
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,830
Yes!

162
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,230
Yes! Yes! Yes!

163
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,220
How can you say that?!
I'm the weakest girl here!

164
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,910
It's only natural that I hold onto this whistle!

165
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,390
I wanna blow it!

166
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:27,060
You just wanna try it out, Luffy! Forget it!

167
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,920
I wanna call the old man here!

168
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,110
Let me hold on to it! I'm the weakest!

169
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,310
You wish! I'm the weakest!

170
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,660
What?! Quit screwin' around!
I'm clearly the weakest!

171
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,050
No, I am!

172
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,560
Don't downplay my hopelessness!

173
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,440
What a strange argument...

174
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,370
'Kay, let's do this! Center of the ship!

175
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,410
I'll put it on the main mast,
so if anyone's in trouble,

176
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,220
they can get the whistle from here and blow it!

177
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,080
Now it's fair!

178
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,740
Alright.

179
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,810
Got it.

180
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,330
Oh, and none of you are allowed to blow it!

181
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,980
Huh? But I wanna call the old man...

182
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,060
Blow it and I'll kick you
to the ends of the earth!

183
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,720
Yes, we'll be careful.

184
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,580
A-All right! Good thing this was here!

185
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,550
Now if anything happens,
the Sky Knight will come save me!

186
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,310
But the whistle is a last resort!

187
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,510
All right! I'm going to work hard
and watch over the ship!

188
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,990
What's that?

189
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,390
Huh? You're the only sacrifice I get to kill?

190
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,940
Cobblestones...

191
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,910
We might find more clues if we follow these...

192
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,180
Say, what do you think that sound was?

193
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,110
Dunno. Stay right there.

194
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,770
I'm sick of you things!

195
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,300
What an unlucky day.

196
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,480
You gotta be careful.

197
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,390
T-Thanks...

198
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,370
Usopp!

199
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Even if we're far apart

200
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,740
I don't want you to forget

201
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:38,420
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

202
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,000
You have a friend here to share the pain

203
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:52,600
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

204
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,100
I won't let it just be a dream

205
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,820
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

206
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:13,580
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

207
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,020
We're in huge trouble, aren't we?

208
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,520
Yeah, it's one thing after another!

209
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,890
So we can't save you yet, Chopper!

210
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,480
Eh?! I'm in big trouble!

211
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,750
You already got a strong ally on your side!

212
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,850
Eh?! O-Oh, right! Sky Knight!

213
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

214
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,640
"Chopper in Danger!
Former God vs. Priest Shura"

215
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
