00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,400
Luffy and Nami were stranded at God's Shrine.

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,590
Eneru's ship is too far from the
top of this vine. What should we do?!

19
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,750
How can we get there?

20
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,450
Isn't there some way?

21
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,620
In the meantime, Eneru had finally
found the golden bell.

22
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,290
So this is it...

23
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,550
Splendid!!

24
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,370
So this is the grand belfry that was
the pride of the legendary city, Shandora!

25
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,430
Nami, who had devised a plan, sent a
message to Usopp and the others.

26
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,340
Oh? There's something written on it.

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,080
"Cut down this huge vine so
it falls towards the west."

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,460
However, Eneru's final attack was imminent.

29
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,130
I've accomplished all my objectives.

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,500
All that's left now is...

31
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,370
...to destroy this land together with the
cumuloregalis clouds using Raigo,

32
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,310
and set off for the Endless Vearth.

33
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,230
Reject!!

34
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,280
Break! Giant Jack!!

35
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,680
Here goes! Get on, Luffy!

36
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,910
Run it at full power!

37
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,670
Okay!

38
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,650
It's insolent of you to try and come
to me!You need to be taught a lesson!

39
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,220
Mamaragan!

40
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,320
"Miracle on God's Land! The
Love Song That Reached the Angels"

41
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,290
Upper Yard is... being pulverized.

42
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,630
Luffy!! Nami!

43
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,130
Looks like he doesn't want to come in
contact with you ever again, huh?

44
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,430
Not a chance!!

45
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,680
The ruins are being exposed!!

46
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,580
He intends to pulverize the ground.

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,220
Wyper's lying on the ground down there!

48
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,790
Zoro, too! That son of a bitch!

49
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,140
The ruins...

50
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,140
It's useless, Eneru.

51
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,750
You can't bring down...

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,730
Wyper!

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,670
...the history of the proud warriors who
lived in the land of Shandora.

54
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,830
No matter where it is, this grand
power is strong, creates and nurtures.

55
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,900
You just can't bring it down!

56
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,620
No matter how many forests you burn...

57
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,480
No matter how many ruins you destroy...

58
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,110
The land won't be beaten!

59
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,490
Get out of there, Wyper!

60
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,080
It's dangerous!

61
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,670
Wyper's gonna die! Let me go, stupid!

62
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,150
Hm? I can still hear driveling from below.

63
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,210
Vearth is... That's right!

64
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,210
It's not sinking!

65
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,170
Upper Yard wasn't affected at all!

66
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
What great power!

67
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,280
That's right. Vearth is so grand!

68
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,100
Vearth wasn't something to fight over,

69
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,220
but the blood of many people was
shed, and many lives were lost.

70
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,870
Why didn't we notice it for 400 years?!

71
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,760
Wyper!

72
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,900
Wyper!!

73
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,840
Get out! The vine is
falling!Come over here, now!!

74
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,720
Go...

75
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,710
Go! Straw Hat!!

76
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,170
"God"

77
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,370
Here I come!! Eneru!!

78
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,210
They're a bunch of...

79
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,060
Hand over... the golden bell!!

80
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,510
Enough of this! I'm sick of you!

81
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,550
I think this is big enough.

82
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,990
"God"

83
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,370
Disappear with the land!

84
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,120
Raigo!

85
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,770
Nami, thanks!

86
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,720
What?!

87
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,020
There's no way I'll let
your help go to waste!

88
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,680
Wait, Luffy!!

89
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,400
The ship is that way!!

90
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,310
Luffy! There's an eddy of
air and lightning in there!!

91
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,270
Who knows what'll happen to you?!

92
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,420
What can you do before
this huge power, rubber man?!

93
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,140
Gum-Gum...

94
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:12,140
...Fi... re... works!!

95
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,400
Gold Peony!!

96
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:38,080
How dare you use thunder to create bad
weather for the idyllic sky islands?!

97
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,860
You lightning freak!!

98
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,000
Wh-What is this abnormal electric discharge?!

99
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:55,430
That's right...! He has gold, which can
transmit electricity, on his hand!

100
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,570
Well, all I have to do is drop it before the
electricity completely discharges!

101
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,220
Everything... be gone!

102
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,720
Captain McKinley! Please stop.This
is God's Land. It's pointless!

103
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,210
I don't care if there's no point!

104
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:27,000
There's nothing else humans can do when
the situation is life or death!

105
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,750
In order to survive,we
chose to abandon our land.

106
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,250
Now we've lost a place to return
to and our way forward.

107
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,770
All that we can do is pray.

108
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:51,310
When we hear the "island's singing
voice," this battle will end.

109
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,430
I wonder if no one will
survive at this point...

110
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,210
I wonder if, had I had the courage
to stand up to Eneru,

111
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,080
I wouldn't have had to
involve those people...

112
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,900
Say, Suu...

113
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I wonder if God exists?

114
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,900
If he does, I wonder if he'd save us...

115
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,190
Please... if you really exist...

116
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,030
...please protect them! God!!

117
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:39,080
Please... make a miracle
happen!Protect this land! God!!

118
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,680
Clear up!!

119
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,380
Clear up!!

120
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,280
The mass of thunderclouds has disappeared!!

121
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,480
What happened?

122
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,540
What?!

123
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,920
Luffy!!

124
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,650
Straw Hat! Ring the "fire of Shandora"!!

125
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,840
Go, Luffy!!

126
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,700
Let us hear the singing voice of the island!

127
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,970
How dare you destroy Raigo?!You
monkey from the Blue Sea!

128
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,300
Well then, I'll ring you as well!!

129
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,910
"God"

130
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,730
You insolent brat!!

131
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,690
200 Million Volt...

132
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,540
...Amaru!!

133
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,830
What the hell is that?!

134
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,630
Ring, you said?! You mean the golden bell?!

135
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,730
The next time it rings,it will
be the end of the battle.

136
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,520
Are you trying to hang onto such a legend?!

137
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,840
I am God!

138
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,040
You are just a Paramythia!

139
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:53,610
There's no way that I can't crush
you with my Logia power!!

140
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,990
I said it doesn't work on me!!

141
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,530
I'm sick of this "I'm God" crap!

142
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,590
What god wouldn't save anything at all?!

143
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,940
Ouch!!

144
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,680
Oh? You grabbed hold of it to
avoid being skewered, huh?

145
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,020
Luffy!!

146
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,430
Ow, ow, it's hot! Ouch!

147
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,310
What are you going to do, rubber man?!

148
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,960
You have nowhere to escape!

149
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,940
The pull of your arm will make the
spear dig deeper and deeper into you!

150
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,960
Yet, if you get away, you'll fall!

151
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,510
You've done well to climb up this high!

152
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,060
However, this is the end of
you and this land, too!

153
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,670
I can create another Raigo!

154
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,790
This is our citizens' duty... I'm sorry!

155
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,090
Luffy... are the sky
islands...going to disappear?!

156
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,160
So you chose to fall!

157
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,940
Luffy!!

158
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,720
Nami! Out of the way!

159
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,430
Wh-What're you...?!

160
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,820
Don't mess with me, earlobes!!

161
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,230
Gum-Gum... Rocket!!

162
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,140
Gum-Gum...

163
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,570
Are you trying again?!

164
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,290
Until the bell rings!!

165
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,920
This time, I'll skewer you!

166
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,920
Gold Rifle!!

167
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,770
It's too fast!!

168
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:02,370
When you return to Jaya, what will you
think when you see we're gone?

169
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,410
Hold on a little longer! I'll let you know...

170
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,500
...that "we are here"!

171
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,440
Light the fire of Shandora!!

172
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,070
It's been 400 years since the
battle in the sky started.

173
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,570
Just once, we wanted to...

174
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,900
That's right. The sacred ground will...

175
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,790
...sing again...

176
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,130
...someday, for sure.

177
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,320
Six years ago, I saw a giant city of
goldon the Grand Line island of Jaya!

178
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,800
The city of gold does exist!

179
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:31,630
No one in history's ever disproved the
city of gold or the sky island.

180
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,470
That's what romanticism is!

181
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,060
Reach!!

182
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,550
Old guy! Can you hear it?

183
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
The city of gold is here!

184
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,030
For 400 years, the city of gold has
been here all this time...

185
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,120
...in the sky!!

186
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

187
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens as you wander about

188
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,you
keep your gaze constant

189
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection
wanes as you slowly disappear

190
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

191
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who
spend countless nights drifting

192
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

193
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

194
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,420
I can hear the bell. This is romanticism!

195
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,670
I thought the story was a meaningless fantasy
and I'd forgotten about it.

196
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,470
But there is only one bell in this
world that echoes this much.

197
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,350
The city of gold was in the sky!

198
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,560
Noland wasn't... My ancestor wasn't a liar!!

199
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

200
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,740
"The Battle Ends! Proud Fantasia Echoes Far"

201
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,970
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
