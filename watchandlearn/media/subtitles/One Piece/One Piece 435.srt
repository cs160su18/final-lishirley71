2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,830
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,610
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,880
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,000
Luffy met Buggy, former
Baroque Works agents Mr. 3

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,500
and Mr. 2 Bon Clay in the prison
and they all fell into level 4!

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,460
Smells good...

56
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,500
Ouch, ouch... Smells good...

57
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,100
I've had enough of you running
around and playing by your rules!

58
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,730
Who're you?!

59
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,320
M-Magellan!

60
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,050
You're dead, you vermin!

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,290
"Mighty Magellan! Bon Clay Bugs Out!"

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,940
Uh oh! I gotta get out of here!

63
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,900
The Burning Heat Floor is too hot!

64
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,300
W-Warden! W-Wait for just a second!

65
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,570
Don't start fighting yet!

66
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,410
Get away from here! Warden's
poison will get us, too!

67
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,960
Damn you! I was about to find
all of that good smelling food!

68
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,050
I'm hungry! You need to get out of my way!

69
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,990
You're so high-spirited. Don't worry.

70
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,390
You won't need to think
about eating ever again!

71
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,130
What do you mean?

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,460
S-Straw-chan! Don't fight him!

73
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,320
He's the warden of Impel Down--Magellan!

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,080
He ate the Venom-Venom Fruit!

75
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,930
You gotta run away! He's the last
person that you wanna fight!

76
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,200
Venom-Venom? He's poisonous?

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,880
Yes, I am.

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,020
Straw Hat Luffy! You're a rookie pirate

79
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,580
with a 300 million berry price
whose caused far too many problems

80
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,630
by rebelling against the Navy
and the World Government!

81
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,880
And now, you've snuck into this great,

82
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,600
historic prison with iron-tight security!

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,560
I have to thank you for ruining
my reputation as a warden!

84
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,020
I know why you're here!

85
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,680
You came to rescue your
brother Portgaz D. Ace,

86
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,450
the second division commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates!

87
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:32,830
But I assure you that there's no way that
you can save him and get out of Impel Down!

88
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,790
Straw Hat Luffy! This is where
you will meet your fate!

89
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,580
I'll find out all about when
and how you broke in...

90
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,550
...after I pass down your sentence!

91
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,430
Come out, Luffy!

92
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
That was close!

93
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,100
It looks like I can't
go any farther with you.

94
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,120
I can't use my power while
wearing those Sea Prism cuffs.

95
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,320
And they'll take my cloak
away so I can't hide you.

96
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,860
I wish I could do more but...

97
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,620
What're you talking about?

98
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,120
I wouldn't have made it this
far without your help!

99
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,370
Luffy.

100
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,080
I'm not gonna tell you
even if it means death!

101
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,480
Every prisoner says that
before they are tortured!

102
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:32,010
However, Straw Hat, what you're about
to go through is far worse than torture!

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,940
Straw-chan!

104
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,480
Magellan's whole body is poisonous
so you can't even touch him!

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,850
Do you think you can beat a guy like that?!

106
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,850
I will!

107
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,120
Let's go back to the Pool
of Blood and turn right!

108
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,780
Straw-chan! Give up on that
food and let's get to level 5!

109
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,530
That's no use!

110
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,670
Three demon guards and their commander
are guarding the staircase to level 5!

111
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,540
What?!

112
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,080
All exits on this floor
have already been covered!

113
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
There's no way for you to...

114
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,140
I'll let them get away and
lay the blame on Warden!

115
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,600
...get out of here!

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,470
No! I don't wanna believe it!

117
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,820
Hydra!

118
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,750
W-What's that?!

119
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,070
Made out of poison?!

120
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,740
A body of pure poison?!

121
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,370
Gum-Gum...

122
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,750
...Pistol!

123
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,170
No!

124
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,450
--Straw-chan!
--Bon-chan!

125
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,910
--Why did you do that?!
--I told you that you can't fight!

126
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,290
The poison will harm you
if you get it all over you

127
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,770
but even one touch will be lethal!

128
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,740
I can't fight without touching it!

129
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,080
That's why you can't fight him!

130
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,120
Can't you say anything
other than "you can't"?

131
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,420
Magellan's target is Straw-chan!

132
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,080
Un, deux, trois!

133
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,130
Gum-Gum...

134
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,090
Gum-Gum...

135
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,090
...Queer Pistol!

136
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,100
...Queer Gatling!

137
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,060
...Queer Giant Scythe!

138
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,440
Now, can you tell which
is the real Straw-chan?

139
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,940
I'm sure it's very hard to tell!

140
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,440
Bon-chan, your clothes...

141
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,910
You gotta get away while I draw the
Hydra's attention to me, Straw-chan!

142
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,800
Huh?

143
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,750
Here, here! I'm here, Hydra-chan!
Come on, come on! Oh come on!

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,720
I got you!

145
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,790
I said "that's no use!"

146
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,050
--There are more?!
--No!

147
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,010
Oh Come My Surprise!

148
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,670
Please wait, Warden Magellan!
We're still evacuating...

149
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,190
Augh! Why is he poisoning his own people?!

150
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,780
No! Hydra's poison is a paralytic neurotoxin!

151
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,490
It's gonna run through your body causing
horrible pain and eventually it will kill you!

152
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,580
It hurts! Get me an antidote now!

153
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Augh! Stay away!

154
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,130
Get away when I'm fighting! Fools!

155
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,510
I-I'm very sorry, sir!

156
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,880
I'm hungry, hungry, hungry!

157
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,720
He still has an appetite
under these circumstances!

158
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Straw-chan is quite a guy!

159
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,890
But it seems impossible
to get away from Magellan!

160
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,070
Follow me if you can!

161
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,860
Ouch, ouch, ouch! Ouch!

162
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,780
I-I-It's burning!

163
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,450
Yes! One head's gone!

164
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,250
That's what I'd expect from Ace's brother.

165
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,960
But it's over now!

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,790
Oh no! Warden Magellan's gonna do it!

167
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,640
Chloroform Ball!

168
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,270
That was close!

169
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,060
Put your gas masks on! Stay clear!
Warden's in the midst of a battle!

170
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,570
--Tear and sneeze gas?!
--Damn! It's Magellan's poison gas!

171
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,820
--Go somewhere else to fight!
--Atchoo! Who's the opponent?

172
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,290
Atchoo! Maybe the intruder
that they were talking about?

173
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,790
Now it's poison gas in addition to
the heat of hell?! Give me a break!

174
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,960
Atchoo! What the... Atchoo! Atchoo!

175
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,380
My eyes itch and they're tearing up!

176
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,060
What happened to me?! I
can't fight... Atchoo!

177
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,600
...Like this! Atchoo!

178
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,890
What's happening now?!
The Hydra stopped moving!

179
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,400
Venom Road!

180
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,780
No matter how hard you try...

181
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,120
...you can't get away from me!

182
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,850
Can't see a thing!

183
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,250
Did you want to touch these?!

184
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,990
One touch and it's all over.

185
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,380
Augh! The rock wall is melting!

186
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,590
Now, it's your turn to melt!

187
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,590
I need to rescue Ace...

188
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,390
In the end, brothers like you and Ace...

189
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,020
...share the same fate!

190
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,250
Please! Give me the antidote now!

191
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,630
They were poisoned by Warden?

192
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,970
Yeah, I heard that he's fighting
with Straw Hat Luffy right now!

193
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,840
If it goes bad, we're gonna get poisoned too!

194
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,600
I hope we don't!

195
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,810
Looks like Straw Hat's in a tough battle!

196
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,890
It's good for us!

197
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,730
Why?

198
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,570
Warden Magellan is the
strongest one in Impel Down

199
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,780
and he's focusing on Straw Hat now!

200
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm sure that they are guarding
the staircase to level 3, too

201
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,370
but at least, we know that we
won't face the worst terror!

202
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,140
That means that this is our chance!

203
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,130
Straw-chan's in trouble!

204
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,240
But I can't do anything for my dear friend!

205
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,220
This is the least I can do!

206
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,690
Straw-chan!

207
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,980
Hang in there!

208
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm just...

209
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,320
...spinning for you!

210
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,910
It's not gonna help him!

211
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,700
How stupid am I?!

212
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,210
My life will be worth something
if I can die for my friend!

213
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,540
You gotta get up and fight in the
name of Oh Come My Way, Bon Clay!

214
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,340
Having said that...

215
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,170
I can't move my legs!

216
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,400
Ouch!

217
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,610
Straw-chan!

218
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,030
I can't even help my friend?

219
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,990
Can't I do something?!

220
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,450
Calm down and think!

221
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,460
Swan...

222
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,170
...Arabesque!

223
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,260
Swan is dead...

224
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,510
Gimme a break!
It's not gonna work!

225
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,770
Wait just a Fouett?!

226
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,600
The rose wilts...

227
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,900
Gimme a break! That won't work either!

228
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,000
Memoirs of a Winter's Sky!

229
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,790
I did it!

230
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,210
The garden of Oh Come My Way is calling me...

231
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,540
Absolutely not! I've run out of ideas!

232
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,300
I can't think of anything!

233
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,260
I can't... No matter what
I do, I can't help him!

234
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,320
Gum-Gum...

235
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,900
...Stamp!

236
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:49,440
Magellan guards the worst prisoners
in the worst prison in the world!

237
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,960
He's the master of hell!

238
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
Make up your mind, Bon Clay!

239
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm sorry!

240
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,020
There's no way to beat Magellan!

241
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,450
We have no chance to win!
I'm sorry but I gotta run!

242
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm sorry, Straw-chan! I'm sorry!

243
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,210
This is our only chance to get away
while Magellan is fighting Straw Hat!

244
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,980
Are you out of your mind, you idiot?!

245
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,210
Look how many there are!

246
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,050
It doesn't matter! Think about it!

247
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,100
They put demon guards at
the staircase to level 5

248
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,940
because they don't want to let
Straw Hat get to the lower levels!

249
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,900
The security here is the poorest!

250
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,700
If we miss this chance, they'll
tighten their defenses!

251
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,610
This is our best chance! Because
eventually Straw Hat's gonna lose!

252
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,850
We gotta get to level 3 before that!

253
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,730
Maybe you're right!

254
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,330
I never heard anything about Vice Warden
Hannyabal eating any Devil Fruit!

255
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,840
If I can blow the others
up with my Muggy Ball,

256
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,040
all we have to deal with is Hannyabal!

257
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,050
That's right! Let's do it!

258
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,020
I don't want to stay in this heat anymore!

259
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
Ready?!

260
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,520
--We're gonna fight our way through!
--Right!

261
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,320
Hannyabal-sama! Here come
Buggy the Clown and Mr. 3!

262
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,910
They're trying to get to
level 3! Don't let them!

263
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,530
Muggy...

264
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,810
Candle...

265
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,960
Wait!

266
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,590
Stand down, everyone!

267
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,960
Hannyabal-sama!

268
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,510
I'm the vice warden and I'm in charge here!

269
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,300
Yes! Here comes my chance!

270
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,930
Heaven is on my side!

271
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,980
On top of the invasion of Straw Hat Luffy,
if these two are allowed to pass through,

272
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,360
I'm sure that the top
officials won't be happy!

273
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,920
And they're gonna blame Warden
Magellan for all of this!

274
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,950
And then...

275
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,830
I will become the warden!

276
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,710
Hannyabal-sama! Shouldn't we catch them?!

277
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,560
What shall we do?! Give us an order!

278
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,460
Alright, clear the way!

279
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,660
What?!

280
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,260
We were expecting you! Please come this way!

281
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,590
Hurry and make way!

282
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,060
Don't be rude to our guests!

283
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,100
Is it okay to do this?

284
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,270
Maybe this is a part of
the Vice Warden's plan!

285
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,740
Please! Go right ahead!

286
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,950
Screw you!

287
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,120
We see through your plan, you fool!

288
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,970
It can't be this easy!

289
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,220
We know that this is a trap!

290
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,040
Special weapon--Muggy Ball!

291
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,010
Candle Lock!

292
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,160
Why didn't you just go?!

293
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,400
You stupid bastards!

294
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,490
--Oh no!
--Oh yeah!

295
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,660
Don't you wanna give up now?

296
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,250
I'm gonna rescue Ace

297
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,420
and we're gonna get out of here!

298
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,050
I'm not gonna die without even seeing him!

299
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,430
I'm not gonna let you execute Ace!

300
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,720
What's that smoke?!

301
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,200
I don't wanna lose to you by not
touching you because you're poisonous!

302
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,400
I'd rather touch you and...

303
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,240
...give you my arms!

304
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't want your arms!

305
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,920
But if you want me to have
them, I'll take them!

306
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,960
Gum-Gum...

307
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,440
...Jet Bazooka!

308
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,210
Luffy, after attacking Magellan,
whom was unscathed,

309
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,960
ends up trapped by the Venom-Venom Fruit.

310
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,160
In order to save Ace, Luffy brashly
releases a self-destructive attack!

311
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,010
What will the battle's outcome be?

312
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,930
"The Showdown Has Come!
Luffy's Desperate Last Attack!"

314
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
