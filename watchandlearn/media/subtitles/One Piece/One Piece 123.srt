2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,680
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,410
What?! A cannonball will be shot
into the Square in ten minutes?!

20
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,140
That's right. The attack is scheduled at 4:30.

21
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,970
4:30?!

22
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,490
We found you, Princess Vivi!

23
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,900
I wonder how far I'll be
promoted if I kill you...

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,010
I'll go on ahead!

25
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,780
On ahead!

26
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,190
Ten more minutes...!

27
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,440
This is really the last chance!

28
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,230
The next ten minutes...
will decide... this country's fate...!

29
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,310
Gum-Gum... Bazooka!

30
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,130
We don't have the slightest
intention of giving way to you!

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,890
Don't get in my way! Treinta Fleurs!

32
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,470
Strangle!

33
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,590
Sergeant Major! This woman... is Nico Robin!

34
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,920
She's got a bounty and was talked
about worldwide 20 years ago!

35
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,110
My right hand dries out everything...

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,170
Ground Death!

37
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,880
"That Looks Gator-ish!
Luffy, Run to the Royal Tomb!"

38
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,670
That was close!
His right hand is a problem...

39
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,630
The lawn has turned into desert!

40
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,100
Where'd he go?

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,170
You made me waste my energy...

42
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,910
You missed...

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,620
Cro...co...

44
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,290
You...

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
...lose again...

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,750
Straw Hat Luffy... This is a good way to die...

47
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,680
Within six minutes or so, this yard will
be blown up along with the Square.

48
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,230
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry...

49
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,180
You just relax here and celebrate the
birth of a new king of the sand country.

50
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,810
Well...

51
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,240
I should get going, too...

52
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,780
He said it's in the mortuary
temple to the west of here...

53
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,340
Ahh! That was close! I thought I was a goner!

54
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,130
That bastard... He's gone now...

55
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,110
I saw him flying that way!

56
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,540
I won't let him get away! That gator!

57
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,860
"West of the palace -- The mortuary temple
(royal tomb)"

58
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,370
So this is the royal tomb... where the
bodies of generations of kings sleep...

59
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,930
Where's the Poneglyph?

60
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,480
Hidden stairs!

61
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,430
The Poneglyph is deep underground.

62
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,530
Normally, people aren't even
aware of Poneglyphs' existence...

63
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,410
What's happening behind the scenes is deep.

64
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,650
Even if countries belong
to the World Government,

65
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,400
it doesn't mean their kings know everything.

66
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,810
You aren't to be blamed...

67
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,610
...since you probably didn't know
there was someone in this world

68
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,070
who can decipher them.

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,100
You can read Poneglyphs?

70
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,570
Yes... That's why Crocodile and I teamed up.

71
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,310
Because of that, he can't kill me.

72
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,990
It's likely that the Poneglyph in
this country tells where Pluton is.

73
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,270
Isn't that right?

74
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,880
I don't know...

75
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,120
Alabasta's royal family has been
obligated for generations to protect it.

76
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,740
That's all it is to us.

77
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,200
Protect?! Don't make me laugh!

78
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,500
What an impressive-looking place...

79
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,460
It's behind the doors in the back.

80
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,040
Indeed...

81
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,270
I won't... let you go...

82
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,780
How many times do you have to
come at me before you're satisfied?

83
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,330
Nico Robin...

84
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,400
I'll... capture you...

85
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,090
Croco...dile...

86
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,850
Looks like you were taken
down by that woman...

87
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,480
I never thought that you'd
follow me to this town... Navy...

88
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,050
Where's your boss? Did that
smoke bastard run away?

89
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,070
Losers can't speak about justice.
We're in that kind of sea.

90
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,830
Go back to your base and just devote
your time to talking about justice.

91
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,100
Crocodile!

92
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,630
You small fry...!

93
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,740
What the heck are you doing?!

94
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,400
What am I doing?! I'm trying to
put myself in Crocodile's shoes!

95
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,900
Like, if I were him, where
would I shoot a cannon from...?

96
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,200
Forget it! Just look for the cannoneer!
We've got less than five minutes!

97
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,910
Five more minutes! A million lives
will be blown up in five minutes!

98
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,170
We gotta hurry...! We gotta
hurry up and find the cannoneer!

99
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,920
Chopper! Can't you find
the guy by using your nose?

100
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,820
I can't. The smell of
gunpowder is all over the town!

101
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,590
Then... listen.

102
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,420
Find the smell of "a cannoneer who may
be aiming at the center of the Square."

103
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,460
What kind of smell is that?

104
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,210
How should I know?! Try your best!

105
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,330
What?!

106
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,880
A cannonball that can
blow up a 5 km diameter...

107
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,830
Wait. Then it must be big...

108
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,510
If it is to be shot from a cannon,
it won't travel very far...

109
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,830
Then it should be closer
to the Square after all?!

110
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,230
Ahh! I don't have time to go around!

111
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,110
I'll take a shortcut!

112
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,580
How is it from the sky, Pell?!

113
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,320
I searched every corner of the rooftops
of the buildings near the Square,

114
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,830
but I saw no preparations
for the cannon anywhere.

115
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,400
Then... it might be from
somewhere inside a building...

116
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,810
I'll search all of them!

117
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,160
Okay!

118
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,060
Straw Hat!

119
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,020
Where did... the gator go?

120
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,540
We've been warned that at 4:30 pm,
an explosion will happen

121
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,810
in the Palace Square where the
rebellion is going on right now!

122
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,530
Please stop it somehow!
A million lives are at stake!

123
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,040
Losers can't speak about justice.
We're in that kind of sea.

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,290
Go back to your base and just devote
your time to talking about justice.

125
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,750
Tell me! Where's the gator?!

126
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,230
He went in the direction
of the mortuary temple.

127
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,210
That way?! Thanks!

128
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,710
What justice...

129
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,390
The hell with Navy Headquarters...

130
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,910
Oh? I can't move well...

131
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,750
This is strange... when I ate meat...

132
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,460
What's wrong...?
These are such small wounds...

133
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,110
I wonder if I'm a little tired...

134
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,680
Did it tell you what you wanted to know?

135
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,740
Hm...? Oh, I see... Hidden stairs...

136
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,690
Four... four more minutes...!

137
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,130
Aren't there any others?!
Is this all this country is hiding?

138
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,640
You're not satisfied? I kept my promise.

139
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,310
Yes...

140
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,070
Just as you'd expect from a national secret...

141
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,750
No matter how desperately you search,

142
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,530
it can't be found unless you know where it is.

143
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,180
So this is the Poneglyph, huh, Nico Robin?

144
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,240
That didn't take long...

145
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,790
It's strange, or how should I put it...
Were you able to decipher it?

146
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,290
Yes.

147
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,920
Good. Now, read...
the so-called Poneglyph...

148
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,980
Kahira conquered Alabasta...
in Sky Ephemeris Year 239.

149
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,060
In 260, Taymer ruled the Bitain Dynasty.

150
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,070
In 306, the Taff Cathedral
was completed in Erumalu.

151
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,960
In 325, the hero Mamdin of Oltia...

152
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,720
Hey, hey... Wait! Wait!
Is that what we wanna know?!

153
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,610
Who cares about the history of this country?

154
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,350
Just tell me the location of the world's
most disastrous "military power"

155
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,780
that is sleeping in this country!

156
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,050
Where is the Pluton?!

157
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,510
It's not written here.

158
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,810
What?!

159
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,270
History is the only thing written here.

160
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,270
Is that true?!

161
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,480
Pluton... I didn't see that
word mentioned even once.

162
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,440
Well... I see... That's unfortunate...

163
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,440
You've been an excellent
partner to me, but...

164
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,200
...I think I'll kill you here.

165
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,410
Wha...?!

166
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,820
The agreement that we made four
years ago has been achieved here.

167
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,030
This is what you said then.

168
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,900
If I take you to where the Poneglyph is,

169
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,790
you'd turn over the information
on the weapon to me...

170
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,820
Your work in Baroque Works
these past four years was excellent

171
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,150
both in terms of brainpower
and command ability.

172
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,330
That's enough for me... to say
that you were a useful woman.

173
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,830
But... you broke your word at the end!

174
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,410
The Poneglyph in this country doesn't
even show a clue on the Pluton.

175
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,510
Or... is it that you weren't
planning to tell me from the start,

176
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,630
even if you found out?

177
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,850
However... I don't feel
any anger against you...

178
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,110
You know why, Nico Robin?

179
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,290
How silly... We were a team for four years.

180
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,400
I knew you'd pull something like this.

181
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,380
Water?!

182
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,870
If you get wet, a knife
can stick in you, right?!

183
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,920
He dodged it! Where'd he...

184
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,780
I'll forgive you for everything, Nico Robin...

185
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,500
...because I've never... trusted
anyone... from the beginning.

186
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,640
I now know from Cobra's reaction
that Pluton really exists.

187
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,660
I don't have to depend on the
Poneglyph. I'll find it on my own.

188
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,650
Once this country becomes mine,
it's just a matter of time.

189
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,300
Hm?! What's going on?! It's still too
early for the attack on the Square!

190
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,260
It must be you. What'd you do?!

191
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,000
Well... nothing major...

192
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,060
This underground sacred temple is built

193
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,060
so that pulling just one small column
out will cause the entire balance

194
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,270
to be disrupted and destroy the temple.

195
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,220
You two... will die here with me.

196
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,280
As the 12th king of the Nefertari Family,

197
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,980
I can't give this sand kingdom
to someone like you.

198
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,970
Where is it? Three minutes left...

199
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,520
A cannon big enough to
blow up a 5 km diameter...

200
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,880
There can't be many places
where such a thing would fit...

201
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,070
Why can't we find it when
we search this much...?

202
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,110
An open space where a big cannon can fit...

203
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,890
A stray bullet!

204
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,310
An open space...

205
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,160
Hey, no fair, Koza! You were
hiding in a place like this?!

206
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,840
Leader! No fair!

207
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,880
That's right... That place can...

208
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,580
That's dangerous, you bastard! Smoke Star!

209
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,370
It doesn't attract people's
attention and it's a big space.

210
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,230
Idiot! Ahh! I'm not from the Rebel Army!

211
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,000
Usopp Hammer!
Usopp's Rubberband of Doom!

212
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,540
Did that teach you, you bastard!
Geez... who do they think I am?

213
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,230
Don't be surprised when I
tell you this. No, be surprised!

214
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,690
I am that famous Captain... U...

215
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,740
What? O-Oh, it's you, Vivi.
Did you find the cannoneer?!

216
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,650
I figured it out! It's gotta be there!

217
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,280
What?! Really?! Okay, then! I'll signal them!

218
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,240
In any case, I'll call everyone!
You're sure about it, right?

219
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,110
Yes!

220
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,740
Special Attack... Red Serpent Star!

221
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,240
Ahh?!

222
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,420
Oh?!

223
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,000
Boy, I slept well.

224
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,460
Huh...? Oh, that's right.

225
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,950
My body suddenly became
incapable of moving...

226
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,880
...so I decided to risk it and take
a nap since it couldn't be helped.

227
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,740
And now I feel fine, so...

228
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,840
Oh, yeah!

229
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,840
Gator! I'll beat him up!

230
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,700
That hole...

231
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
It looks gator-ish...

232
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,680
Whoa... You're a model king...

233
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,030
Are you trying to be buried alive,
taking me with you...

234
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,520
...for the country...?!

235
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,520
But... you can't kill me...

236
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,730
Hm?

237
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,560
I can change all the bedrocks
into sand and escape from here.

238
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,970
You'll die in vain, Cobra.

239
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,230
It's now less than three minutes.

240
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,150
With the collapse of this sacred temple
and the big explosion of the Square,

241
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,940
everyone in my way will
be blown up in an instant!

242
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,300
In that moment, this land...
will become my country.

243
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,900
Crocodile!! Where are you?!

244
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,890
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

245
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,660
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

246
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:38,870
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

247
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:44,310
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

248
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:50,510
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

249
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:56,850
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

250
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,790
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

251
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,890
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

252
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,800
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

253
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,770
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

254
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,940
A never-ending journey to be together

255
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,440
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

256
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,790
I've cornered you, gator!

257
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,880
Straw Hat... Why are you alive?

258
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,990
Just how many times do you want to be killed?

259
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,530
What? Is the cannoneer really in such a place?!

260
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,390
Yes! There's nowhere else I can think of!

261
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,990
Okay then! Everyone's headed here.
So we'll leave a message!

262
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,090
I'm gonna go on ahead!

263
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,430
What?! Hey, Vivi! Wait! Wait for me!

264
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,700
On the next episode of One Piece!

265
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,470
"The Nightmare Draws Near!
This is the Sand Sand Clan's Secret Base"

266
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
