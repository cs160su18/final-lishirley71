00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,140
He's not here!

22
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,970
Which guy?

23
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,270
That guy!

24
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,900
That guy?

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,540
That tin bastard!

26
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,210
Ahhh! That bastard!

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,530
I'll find him right away and finish him off!

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,280
What's going on here?

29
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,740
What have they done... to my castle?!

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,270
Doctorine...

31
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,110
Hm?

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,580
He called me...

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,750
his friend...

34
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,630
"When the Kingdom's Rule Ends!
The Flag of Faith Flies Forever!"

35
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,210
This is no time to be in bed resting!

36
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,580
I should get out of here
while Doctorine isn't around!

37
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,070
I couldn't take being stuck
here for three days.

38
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,990
Huh?

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,370
I got lucky! Looks like I can
leave without a problem.

40
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,870
Wh-Who's... this guy?!

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,840
You must be one of the Straw Hats!

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,550
He definitely looks like a bad guy!

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,050
No, that's not true at all!

44
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,350
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about!

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,310
What?! I'm wrong?! Really?!

46
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,040
That's right! I'm a navigator
who's just passing by here!

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,420
Oh, I see...

48
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,140
Well then... see ya...

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,740
Okay!

50
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,450
Hm?!

51
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,950
Liar!

52
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,440
--No!
--You idiot! Wait!

53
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,200
Don't come this way! Go away!

54
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,090
Did I gain some weight recently?

55
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,430
Then I'll do this...
Munch Munch Factory!

56
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,420
I'll eat myself!

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,060
Ah! What's that?!

58
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,000
H... He turned into a bucket!

59
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,900
Miraculous bone structure
shaping technique... complete!

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Slim Wapol!

61
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,800
I won't let you escape.

62
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,470
No!

63
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll eat you first!

64
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,320
I found you!

65
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,280
Huh? Was he that skinny before?

66
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,450
Ahh!

67
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,690
Luffy... Why is my jacket all beaten up...?

68
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,670
Ahh!

69
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,420
How much do you think I paid
for this jacket?! 28,800 berries!

70
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,070
And that's the price
after I talked them down!

71
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:37,100
I'm sorry, but that guy shot a bomb
at me! I couldn't help it!

72
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,020
Geez... but oh well. I'll forgive you.

73
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,790
I didn't expect it to come back in
good shape when I let you borrow it.

74
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,970
As payment for the damages,
you owe triple that amount plus some.

75
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,550
The total is 100,000 berries.
Consider it a loan.

76
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,820
Ahh! Don't tell me you
expected this to happen!

77
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
That's it, you bastards!

78
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,300
Darn! His body sure is made tough...

79
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,860
Look! Believe it or not,
this is the arsenal!

80
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm the only one who has
the key to this room.

81
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,220
Naturally, there are a wide
variety of weapons in here.

82
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,600
When I eat them up and make them

83
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,140
part of my body using
Munch Munch Shock,

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,490
you'll witness a horrific human weapon!

85
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,250
Now, be prepared. The door will open!
It'll be scary!

86
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,500
The key to that horrific door is...

87
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,330
gone!

88
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,190
No, this isn't over yet.

89
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,510
Ah! He's running away! Wait!

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,910
I've got another trump card.

91
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,890
Oh, it's just the key to the arsenal.

92
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,550
It would've been nice if it
were a key to a treasure room.

93
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,430
How disappointing...

94
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,970
Nami-san!

95
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,020
Good! You're safe!

96
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,410
What happened?! Why're you crawling
like that, Sanji-kun? Are you all right?

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,660
Nami-san, you're that concerned about me?!

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,000
If I get enveloped in that warmth...

99
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,090
Don't!

100
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,780
Nami...-san...

101
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,130
Wait! Wait, wait!

102
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,300
Dammit! The upper levels
are full of snow, too!

103
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,480
I won't let them get away
with this...! I won't!

104
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,270
I'll make them all experience
how great the king is!

105
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,140
The power of Drum is my power.

106
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,490
I'll use the ultimate weapon
of the Drum Kingdom...

107
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,580
the Tin Titan Royal Crown
Seven Barrel Cannon!

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,710
I've now cornered you! Be prepared!

109
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,800
Humph! It's you who's
corndered, Straw Hat!

110
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,130
Time to be blown away!

111
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,140
Huh...?

112
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,290
A bird's nest...!

113
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,790
Snow Birds!

114
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,840
How dare you make fun of me!

115
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm surprised to see a rope connected
to the castle from a place like this...

116
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,060
A young man in town found it by accident.

117
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,700
This place used to be Dr. Kureha's house!

118
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,140
This is a great view!

119
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,040
Yeah... Hey, isn't this
a little overcrowded?

120
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,290
We can't let Dalton-san
go alone when he's injured!

121
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,730
We'll fight, too!

122
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,210
W-Well, I get it. But we'll
never get there like this!

123
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,750
Paddle! Paddle harder!

124
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,800
Dalton-san, don't push too hard.

125
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,090
Wapol...

126
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,290
Who do you think you are, Dalton?

127
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,700
"There's no medicine that
can cure fools" you say...?

128
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,730
Did you just call me a fool?

129
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,610
You think you've become an emissary of
justice who saves people or something?!

130
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,320
Don't be so full of yourself!
You're just a retainer!

131
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,360
A week or so in this cell will probably
make you realize your mistake.

132
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,130
I'd imagine an impulsive rebellion
wouldn't last so long.

133
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,390
You're an excellent guard
the citizens trust.

134
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,590
Reconsider it, Dalton.

135
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,600
Thanks to that idiot doctor Hiriluk,
you just got caught up in a little fantasy!

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,640
Giving up your status
and destroying the country...

137
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,610
What good will that do you?!

138
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,360
I'll forgive you, if you can just say...

139
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,490
"I'm sorry" to me, the king, Dalton-kun.

140
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,430
To hell with status! To hell with the king!

141
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,220
I'm the king! I'm the king of
the Drum Kingdom! I'm the king!

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,010
This is it for you.

143
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,890
It doesn't matter...
if you're a king or god...

144
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,860
It doesn't matter who's
great or who's not great!

145
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,400
After all, I'm a pirate.

146
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,500
It does matter, Straw Hat!

147
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,160
The Drum Kingdom is a member
of the World Government.

148
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,000
Now listen. This is a world-class offense!

149
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,920
Like I said, that doesn't matter, either!
This is my own fight!

150
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,090
Y-You damn Straw Idiot...!

151
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,550
I'll digest you!

152
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,720
Try and eat me.

153
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,260
Not yet! Munch Munch Shock!
Tongue Cannon!

154
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,020
Ah! His tongue became a cannon!

155
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,350
Disappear!

156
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,310
Ahh!

157
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,480
Dalton-san! Please hang in there!

158
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,510
What should we do?

159
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,730
Dalton-san! Dalton-san!

160
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,620
Dalton-san!

161
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm... I'm all right.

162
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,070
Dalton-san...

163
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,700
I'll make sure... to end this country!

164
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,180
To hell with history!

165
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,390
Hey hey, wake up, Dalton.

166
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,860
Governance is about caring
for your country... you say?

167
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,300
Governments don't need to have a heart.

168
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,640
He's right. What's important is the system.

169
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,640
Ah!

170
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,260
Wh... What're you doing?!

171
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,040
Let me go! Stop it!

172
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,530
I currently have many patients to treat!

173
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,120
Throw him into the sea!
If he resists, you can kill him.

174
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,980
Hey, let me go! Please!

175
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,300
My patients are waiting for me.

176
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,880
Please!

177
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,040
To hell with state control!

178
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,510
Good... So none of them are sick?

179
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,810
What's wrong with wishing
the country to have a heart?!

180
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,270
D... Dalton-san... What're you...

181
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,320
Dynamite!

182
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,530
Listen, everyone.

183
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,830
When we get to the castle and once
I get inside, lay on the ground.

184
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,770
Are you worried about him?

185
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm not worried about him at all!

186
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,340
He's a pirate!

187
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,630
What an idiot!
He let his guard down!

188
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,040
Actually, that's you.

189
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,830
Wh-What?!

190
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,730
One, two...

191
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,100
What?! What're you going to do?!

192
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,440
Hey, let me go!

193
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,490
Gum-Gum...

194
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,280
Bowgun!

195
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,370
Doctorine...

196
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,480
Yeah... It seems...
that it's finally come...

197
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,180
the end of the long nightmare...

198
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,900
End...

199
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,180
This country is sick right now.

200
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,240
Its citizens, king, and the
government, too, are all sick.

201
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,400
People suffer from a sickness of the heart.

202
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,130
I'll definitely save this country
using medical science one day.

203
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,870
Get out of here, quack!

204
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,630
Never come back!

205
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,460
Run, Chopper!

206
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,840
Whoa!

207
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,680
Ahh!

208
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,510
You'd better be prepared if

209
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,650
you're gonna meddle with
someone else's skull flag!

210
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,660
--Gum-Gum...
--Ahh!

211
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,190
Doctor...

212
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,420
--Hold on a sec!
--Gum-Gum-Gum-Gum-Gum-Gum...

213
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,500
--I'll give you status and a medal!
--Gum-Gum-Gum-Gum-Gum-Gum...

214
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,210
Look! There's someone on top of the castle!

215
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,930
Doctor...

216
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,980
The kingdom is...

217
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,220
The Drum Kingdom is...

218
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,530
Then... I'll make you vice-king...!

219
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,490
about to fall!

220
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,780
...Bazooka!!

221
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,260
The Drum Kingdom
was defeated by the skull.

222
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,680
Alright, then! I'll go check.
Don't worry. You can come later.

223
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,260
Ahhh, Zoro's going ahead of me again!
Serious power, activated!

224
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,140
Hey, let go!

225
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,500
Alright! I got your back.

226
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,650
Hey, if you're scared, you can come later!

227
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,610
Hm?

228
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,040
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm not scared!
Because I'm...

229
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,030
What?!

230
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,660
Luffy!

231
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,280
Ah?! Zoro! Usopp!

232
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,130
Ah!

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,040
What'd you do that for, you jerk?!

234
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,840
Oh, it's you guys!

235
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,190
Since I recognized the
clothes you're wearing,

236
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,430
I thought you were one of them.

237
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,070
So you guys came up, too.

238
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,710
Usopp, didn't you say
you couldn't come up?

239
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,900
Don't be silly!

240
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,780
If I see a mountain in front of me,
I climb it. I'm that kind of guy.

241
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,370
But coming up this cliff
was quite an adventure.

242
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,350
We came up by ropeway. Luffy-san,

243
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,830
are Nami-san and Sanji-san okay?

244
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,330
--Yeah, they're fine now.
--Now, get it together...

245
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,360
--Ahh, I'm glad to hear that!
--Now, get it together...

246
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,790
--Ahh, I'm glad to hear that!
--We were also attacked by

247
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,100
--Ahh, I'm glad to hear that!
--a huge condor on our way!

248
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,750
Man was I surprised.

249
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
But then I was like,

250
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,970
--I'm glad...
--or maybe I should say,

251
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
just what you'd expect from me...

252
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,240
--So,
--The moment it flew at his heart,

253
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,600
--what were you doing
on top of the castle?
--The moment it flew at his heart,

254
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,140
--what were you doing
on top of the castle?
--Captain Me dodged as if dancing

255
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,880
--I was beating the crap out of the king.
--Captain Me dodged as if dancing

256
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,180
--I was beating the crap out of the king.
--and quickly rode on the flying condor!

257
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,790
--Then as I suspected... the one who
--and quickly rode on the flying condor!

258
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,860
--flew far into the sky earlier was Wapol!
--It was actually me!

259
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,280
--flew far into the sky earlier was Wapol!
--I put a rope around its neck and said,

260
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,400
--You beat him...?!
--I put a rope around its neck and said,

261
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,860
--Yep! Why?
--I put a rope around its neck and said,

262
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,840
--Yep! Why?
--"My name is Captain Usopp!"

263
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,820
--"My name is Captain Usopp!"

264
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,160
So what about his two top men?

265
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,240
The reindeer beat them up.

266
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,120
Those two... A reindeer did...?

267
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,300
--How's that? Are you guys amazed?

268
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,830
--Oh yeah! Usopp,
--How's that? Are you guys amazed?

269
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,160
--listen! I found a new friend!
--Check me out!

270
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,460
Hm? What?

271
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,590
Reindeer...

272
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,540
Reindeer...?

273
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,310
Blue nose...

274
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,810
Wait!

275
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,280
For laughing at Hiriluk's death, I apologize!

276
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,720
Without enough power,
you'll just die in vain...

277
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,310
Don't sacrifice yourselves
any longer for this country...

278
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,370
You are that reindeer...

279
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,260
I see... You've been fighting
all this time since then!

280
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,560
Thank you.

281
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,850
Drum will definitely...

282
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,300
definitely be reborn...

283
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,730
Hm?

284
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,630
Ah!

285
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,410
Wh-What's that strange creature?!

286
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,980
A-A reindeer? No...

287
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,420
That's a... m-m-m-mons...

288
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,630
Hey, stop it!

289
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,590
Ahhh! It's a monster!

290
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,190
Don't call him a monster!

291
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,430
He's the new friend I was talking about!

292
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,640
What?! That thing is?!

293
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,230
He got shocked and ran away!

294
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,240
Wait! Monster!

295
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,370
Hey!

296
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,130
Hey!

297
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,070
Reindeer!

298
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,030
Hey, wait!

299
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,990
Hey! Reindeer!

300
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,280
You're my friend!

301
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,220
Hey! Reindeer!

302
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,100
--You're definitely my friend!

303
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,200
--Doctor...
--You're definitely my friend!

304
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,960
--Doctor...
--Hey!

305
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,040
--This is for the best, right?
--Hey!

306
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,540
--This is...
--Wait!

307
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,200
Wait! Reindeer!

308
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,010
No way I'd wait!

309
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,170
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

310
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

311
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

312
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:57,260
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

313
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

314
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,400
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

315
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

316
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,970
Doctorine, thanks for teaching me
medical science all this time.

317
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,370
Although I experienced many hardships,

318
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,050
I love this country where
I met Doctor and you.

319
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,140
But I'm leaving. I'm going out to sea!

320
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,970
I wanna see the world with my own eyes!

321
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,270
