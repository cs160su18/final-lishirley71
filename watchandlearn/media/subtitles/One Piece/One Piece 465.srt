2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,750
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,640
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,850
So let's go

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,190
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,000
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,410
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,880
I'll keep getting back up

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,260
To the future I believe in...

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,350
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,590
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,690
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,610
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,660
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,520
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,460
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,900
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,360
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ
to rescue his brother, Ace

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,020
who will be executed in public!

64
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,450
Meanwhile, the Whitebeard
Pirates storming Marineford...

65
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,660
...begin an all-out war with the Navy!

66
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,700
Oars!

67
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,800
Just a little more to get to Ace-kun!

68
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,730
Doppelman!

69
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,490
Spiky Shadow Lizard!

70
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,310
"Justice for the Winners!
Sengoku's Strategy in Action!"

71
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,270
See? This is how you kill a person!

72
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,190
Captain Oars!

73
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,420
Damn you Warlord!

74
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,520
Captain!

75
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,200
Oars!

76
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,960
Ace-kun...

77
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,640
Oars!

78
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,410
Ace-... kun...

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,420
Ace-...

80
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,760
...kun...

81
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,400
Oars!!

82
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,180
I'll create the most powerful
zombie soldier out of his corpse!

83
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,750
Oars...

84
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,190
Your guard is down, Whitebeard!

85
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,330
Vice Admiral Lonz!

86
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,820
H-He beat the Giant -
the vice admiral of Navy so easily!

87
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,900
Oars...

88
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,290
Climb Oars' body and advance!

89
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,000
INSIDE THE BAY OF MARINEFORD

90
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,460
This is great!

91
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,700
Doflamingo! How could you do that to Oars!

92
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,710
I'll make you pay at any cost!

93
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,330
What's so funny?

94
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,360
What's so funny?

95
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
This feeling that I'm in
the center of history!

96
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,010
This place is the turning point now!

97
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,670
What are you talking about?!

98
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,350
That's our commander!

99
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,400
Doflamingo can't do anything but run now!

100
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,160
R-Rear Admiral Yukimura!

101
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,180
I can't! I can't! I can't!

102
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,290
I'm scared and I can't do anything!

103
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,010
Even those strong fighters
falling one after another!

104
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,710
I can't take this! A loser like me!

105
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,620
Wait, Coby! I'm coming with you!

106
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,140
Get back to the battlefield!

107
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,850
Let me go! Please!

108
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,730
Admiral Akainu! Why is he here?

109
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,540
I'm scared of dying

110
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,190
and when I think about my family,
I feel weak at the knees!

111
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,400
Please! I'm begging you! Please!

112
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,580
We Navy soldiers are...

113
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,870
...fighting pirates with the "justice" of
the world emblazoned on our own backs!

114
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:33,920
Anyone who turns tail and runs
cannot be called a Navy soldier.

115
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,270
I would call him...

116
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,000
...a speck of dirt!

117
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,980
If you truly think about your family,
don't live in disgrace!

118
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,680
N-No! He can't kill a man who's on our side!

119
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,840
Admiral Sakazuki!

120
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,530
We are ready to proceed with the strategy.

121
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,150
Good! The time has come!

122
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,420
"The strategy?"

123
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,800
Ace!!

124
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,910
THE BAY HEAD OF MARINEFORD

125
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,910
Use the space that Oars opened up!

126
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
Get into the bay!

127
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,910
Let's destroy the bay
head to open more space!

128
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,750
Fire straight ahead!

129
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,930
Damn! Not even a scratch!

130
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,690
Leave it to me!

131
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,770
An ice cutter?!

132
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,570
That's "Ice Witch" Whitey Bay!

133
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,310
That was quite easy for us.

134
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,370
Alright, everyone! Let's go!

135
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,870
Thanks!

136
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,370
We must move into the bay, too!

137
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,920
What's the matter, 13th division
commander Water Buffalo Atmos?

138
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,350
M-My body... What did you do, Doflamingo?!

139
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,590
Commander Atmos!

140
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,220
Don't! Stay away from me!

141
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,940
--What's wrong?
--Now!

142
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,310
Commander!

143
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,190
No!

144
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,360
Commander Atmos... Why?

145
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,960
I can't control my body!

146
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,780
Don't do this, Doflamingo!

147
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,000
Commander!

148
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,570
Commander!

149
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,310
"Pirates are evil and the Navy is justice?"

150
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,760
That has been rewritten
many times  in the past!

151
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,890
Values are different to kids
who don't know what peace is

152
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,470
and kids who don't have
firsthand knowledge of war.

153
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,000
The one who ends up on top will rewrite
what's right and what's wrong.

154
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,890
This place is the turning point!

155
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,660
"Justice will prevail?"

156
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,280
Of course, it will!

157
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,580
Because the winners claim justice!

158
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,760
They've broken through
the bay head at 2 points!

159
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:24,210
The bay will be flooded by allies
of the Whitebeard Pirates!

160
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,120
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

161
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,850
No problem.

162
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,370
Tsuru-san, let's put it into action.

163
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,350
THE BAY HEAD OF MARINEFORD

164
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,980
It's a suitable time.

165
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,970
Outta our way!

166
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,200
If not, you'll get more than a wound!

167
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,500
Outta our way, old bag!

168
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,620
I got washed!

169
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,090
I got hung!

170
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,320
But I feel so good!

171
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,250
You're a million years
too early to defeat me.

172
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,520
Connect to all ships and soldiers!

173
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,760
Ring, ring, ring...

174
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,350
Ring, ring, ring...

175
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,270
Ring, ring, ring...

176
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,850
Ring, ring, ring...

177
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,670
Ring, ring, ring...

178
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,730
He's up to something.

179
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,440
A resourceful admiral--"Buddha" Sengoku.

180
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,010
His name is Gol D. Ace.

181
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,890
Old man!

182
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,580
What are you doing here?
Disagree with the strategy?

183
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,380
No, they're pirates.

184
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,710
There's no room for pity!

185
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,850
Then...

186
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,750
Shut up!

187
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,760
It's no big deal.

188
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,840
I just wanna be here.

189
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,140
Stupid!

190
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
Ace!

191
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,990
What's wrong with you, old man!

192
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,490
"I wanna go out to sea?"
I won't let you at any cost!

193
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,430
Don't be bossy, you're not even my father.

194
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,040
I don't have to listen to you, old man.

195
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,750
You better call me grandpa!

196
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,420
Old man.

197
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,230
You wanna get another fist of love?

198
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,500
Grandpa!

199
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,890
I'm gonna be a lot stronger and...

200
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,220
...I wanna go out to sea with Ace!

201
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,800
Ouch!

202
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,280
Stupid! I don't wanna hear it from you, too!

203
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,680
Don't hit Luffy!

204
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,940
Shitty old man.

205
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,110
Shitty?!

206
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,730
Hey, Ace! Come here!

207
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,700
Listen, to be prepared for unexpected battle,

208
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,750
you got to eat to the fullest when you can!

209
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,950
That's important for a Navy soldier!

210
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,380
Both of you, keep that in mind!

211
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,040
Navy?! You can't just decide that for us!

212
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,050
What?!

213
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,090
I'll become a pirate!

214
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,050
You'll join the Navy!

215
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,620
--Pirate! Pirate! Pirate! Pirate!
--Navy! Navy! Navy!

216
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,220
Yum-yum!

217
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,660
No! He ate everything!

218
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,980
It was good!

219
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
So quick!

220
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,280
I'm gonna become a pirate...

221
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,180
If Luffy becomes a Navy soldier,

222
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,240
the food stock of his ship
will be gone within a day.

223
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,860
He would be a bigger
handful than the pirates!

224
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,400
I have no pity for villains but...

225
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,490
...family is a different story.

226
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,270
What am I supposed to do?!

227
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,430
Ace, you fool!

228
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,900
Why didn't you lead your life as I said?!

229
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,060
Ace.

230
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,600
You two should become strong Navy soldiers.

231
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,680
Okay?

232
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,670
Become a strong Navy soldier.

233
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,370
Old man...

234
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,740
If you have your doubts at this final moment,

235
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,890
I take no pity on even you, Garp.

236
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,640
If I had doubts,
I would've done something already!

237
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,440
Did you just hear that,
Helmeppo-san? Their strategy...

238
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,260
Yeah...

239
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,390
They're gonna forget the schedule
and execute "Fire Fist" Ace.

240
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,970
If they do that...

241
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,400
What's that?

242
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,790
What's that?

243
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,910
Something's falling from the sky.

244
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,710
Is that a surprise attack
of the Whitebeards?!

245
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,960
I said that you were doing it too much!

246
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,570
It's because of his wink!

247
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,940
Is it my fault, Croco?!

248
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,820
Doesn't matter, we're gonna die!

249
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,100
It's frozen all over down there!

250
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,190
Heehaw!

251
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,340
Oh! I'm a rubber man so I'll be fine!

252
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,530
You just care about yourself?!

253
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,250
Do something!

254
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,830
I don't wanna die like this!

255
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,510
Somebody, stop me!

256
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,600
I shouldn't have listened to you, Straw Hat!

257
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
Dammit!

258
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,030
Ace!

259
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,970
Luffy and his friends suddenly
appear out of the sky

260
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,100
and drop right in the
middle of the battlefield.

261
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,480
Luffy finally spots his brother, Ace,

262
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,300
and cries out to him.

263
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,750
The final battle to save Ace begins now!

264
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

265
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,950
"Straw Hat Team Arrives!
Tension Grows at the Battlefield"

266
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,950
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
