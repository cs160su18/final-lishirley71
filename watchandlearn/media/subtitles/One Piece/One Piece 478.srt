2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,630
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,860
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,630
He and the Whitebeards finally got over the
cling walls to make it to the scaffold!

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,080
As an all-out battle between the Navy and
the Whitebeards continues at the Oris Plaza,

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,460
Luffy runs toward Ace!

64
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,880
Damn!

65
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,560
Even you can't win out against the
onslaught of time, Whitebeard!

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,270
That's what I was afraid of the most!

67
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,320
If you have an unguarded moment,
you will lose the fight!

68
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,940
Marco!

69
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,120
You can't look away like that!

70
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:36,170
Should I be the last voice
you hear before you die?

71
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,260
Pops!

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,220
If I'd be able to do all I could...

73
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,100
I'd be happy to die!

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,790
Let me fight, Ivan-chan!

75
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,030
If I can't fight now

76
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,650
and if I can't rescue Ace, I...

77
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,620
I'd rather take my own life afterwards!!

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,580
Let me have the strength to fight for now!

79
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,860
All right!

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,670
Do whatever you want!

81
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,600
Luffy!

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,400
Ace!!

83
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,680
"To Live Up to a Promise!
Luffy and Coby Collide!"

84
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,920
So slow! What's taking them so long?!

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,880
I'm sorry for being late!

86
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,710
I brought two executioners as replacements!

87
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,590
--Finally! Hurry and get ready!
--Yes, sir!

88
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,680
Straw boy, once again,

89
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,370
you better keep in mind that the next time
you drop, you won't be able to bounce back!

90
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,480
The Energy Hormone is just fooling your body!

91
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,650
It isn't repairing any of the damage!

92
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,410
I...

93
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,870
I...

94
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,770
I won't fall again!

95
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,630
What?! Another foolhardy statement!

96
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,880
Look at them!

97
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,810
Wait!

98
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,980
They're trying to execute Ace again!

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,400
Oh, well, my words can't change Straw
boy's mind under these circumstances!

100
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,830
All I can do is keep them from beating him!

101
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,820
Straw Hat?!

102
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,910
Straw Hat is coming!

103
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,990
Kill Straw Hat!

104
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,250
Leave it to me!

105
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm gonna finish him!

106
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,780
It's not over! I won't let
you pass through here!

107
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,470
--If you wanna advance...
--...You gotta beat all of us!

108
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,160
We'll show you the spirit of the Navy!

109
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,550
Heads up!

110
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,260
Death Wink!

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,850
10 points! I'll back you up!

112
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,480
Thanks, Ivan-chan!

113
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,940
Luffy-san...

114
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,870
You're...

115
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,830
Coby!

116
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,680
That day...

117
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,550
I've decided to be the King of the Pirates,

118
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,680
so if I die fighting for
that, that's fine with me!

119
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,440
Do you suppose I can do it, too?
If I'm prepared to die for it?

120
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,490
Do what?

121
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,480
Do you think... even I could join the Navy?

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,400
Navy?

123
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,650
Yes! Catching bad guys is my dream!

124
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,370
It's been my dream ever since I was little!

125
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,080
If I hadn't met Luffy-san, I
couldn't have become what I am now.

126
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,950
That's right! In order to
live as a Navy soldier,

127
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,220
I have to fight to change myself!

128
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,090
Because this is a battlefield!

129
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,570
I have to commit myself towards killing him!

130
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,150
Gum-Gum...

131
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,070
Shave!

132
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,530
I'll become a Navy...

133
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,550
...ad...

134
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,590
...admiral someday!

135
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,680
Whoa! Oh, I mean...

136
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,140
I-I-I'm sorry! I got carried away!

137
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,060
It's embarrassing! I wanna crawl in a hole!

138
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,550
After I met you, I became
emboldened a little bit...

139
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,320
Coby!

140
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
You wanna fight me, right?

141
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,150
Then, of course you have to
become such a heavy hitter!

142
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,620
Do you think I can become an admiral?

143
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,660
Next time we see each other,
we'll be much stronger!

144
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,270
And much greater!

145
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,710
Why?

146
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:08,190
They know that it's just a wild dream that
makes me lightheaded at just the thought of it.

147
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,770
Then how can they believe in it?

148
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,150
...Bullet!

149
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,370
He's as strong as I thought!

150
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,830
It's useless. I have to
become much much stronger...

151
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,420
Hey, Coby!

152
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,130
Damn!

153
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,700
What is it this time?!

154
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,980
You guys are...

155
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,940
...the Kuma imposters!

156
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,150
Monkey D. Luffy.

157
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,320
Oh no! What a pain in the ass!

158
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,790
Hey you, watch out!

159
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,090
Boa Hancock. The Seven Warlords.

160
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,550
Abort attack. Friendly operative.

161
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,870
That's right! You guys are on the same side!

162
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,640
Thank you, Hancock!

163
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,690
She's the empress, right?
How do you know her?

164
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,610
Luffy! He called my name again...

165
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,780
Thank you, Hancock.

166
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,660
Every time he calls me like that, I'm so...!

167
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,490
Hancock.

168
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,830
Yes.

169
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,370
Hancock.

170
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,500
Yes.

171
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,950
Hancock!

172
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,750
Yes!

173
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,120
Hancock.

174
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,840
Move aside, Boa Hancock.

175
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,110
I don't want you to call my name!

176
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,070
Magma brat!

177
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,120
P-Pops...

178
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,950
I-I'm on my way!

179
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,790
You are off guard!

180
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,500
Take a couple more of these
and get yourself a good rest!

181
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,720
Pops!

182
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,180
Things don't always go the way you want!

183
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,630
Of course,  Marco the Phoenix regenerates!

184
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,060
Hey! It's your turn now!

185
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,650
Sea Prism Stone?!

186
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,990
Commander Marco!

187
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,870
It looks painful!

188
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,630
Commander Jozu has been beaten, too!

189
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,640
They even beat our commanders one by one...

190
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,960
They're falling apart!
The Whitebeard Pirates!

191
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,770
Old man!

192
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,300
You Fish-Man monster!

193
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,290
Grr! Let me go!

194
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,250
Now move it!

195
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,420
Everyone, beat Whitebeard!

196
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,730
Pops!

197
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:32,360
JUSTICE

198
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,680
Pops!

199
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,890
Stay away!

200
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,700
They think that they can beat me...

201
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,410
...this easily!

202
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:29,140
I don't need any help because I'm...

203
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,130
I'm...

204
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,070
I'm Whitebeard!

205
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,440
H-He's a monster!

206
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,420
Don't hesitate! He's wounded!

207
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,510
--Everybody, follow me!
--Yes, sir!

208
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,650
Did he call me wounded?

209
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:15,990
That's ridiculous! I won't
die from such a small wound!

210
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,160
I won't die from... such a small...!

211
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,510
I know...

212
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,010
...what will happen...

213
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,970
...if I die!

214
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,230
Then, you know,

215
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,400
I can't allow myself to die until...

216
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:08,080
...I see a bright future ahead for my sons!

217
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,160
Right, Ace?

218
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,560
Pops!

219
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,730
You dotard!

220
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,030
What is it?!

221
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,330
W-What are they doing?! Guarding
the back of Whitebeard?!

222
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,750
Are they willing to die with Whitebeard?!

223
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,500
You guys don't have to understand!

224
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,240
We'll defend Pops' glory!

225
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,140
That's too thoughtful, you fools!

226
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,520
Pops...

227
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,150
Captain Squard,  let's go
and fight with Pops, too!

228
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,290
Captain? Where are you going?

229
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,830
Don't come with me.

230
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,250
I'll pay the price in my own way.

231
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,600
If you wanna see the future,
I'll show you now, Whitebeard!

232
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,390
Do it!

233
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,940
Ace!

234
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,490
Ace!

235
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,480
It's no use!

236
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,660
Do you think that I can't
stop you for doing it?!

237
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,790
See it for yourself, Whitebeard!

238
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,590
Don't do it!

239
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Don't do it!

240
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:05,760
Don't do it!!

241
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,250
I'm on my way!

242
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,250
Hey, was that...?!

243
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,090
Conqueror's... Haki!

244
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,300
Hey, come on! For real?!

245
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,270
That was surprising!

246
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,990
That brat...

247
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,510
Luffy unconsciously used the Conqueror's
Haki and stopped Ace's execution.

248
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,050
But the Navy, wary of his
display of latent power,

249
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,890
combine their efforts in an
attempt to eliminate him.

250
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Just then, Iva-san finally
reveals his last trump card!

251
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

252
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,150
"The Scaffold at Last! The
Way to Ace Has Opened!"

253
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
