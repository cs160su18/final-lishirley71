2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,900
After realizing the purity of his heart

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,270
and hearing about his fight
against the Celestial Dragons,

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,320
Hancock finally came to trust Luffy.

41
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,480
"Saving Ace! The Next Stop:
the Great Prison!"

42
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,170
Are you really gonna give me a ride?!

43
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,630
Don't worry. I wouldn't lie.

44
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,670
That's great! It doesn't have to be
a great boat as long as it sails.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,180
Departure will be tomorrow morning.

46
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,570
The Kuja Pirates will give you a
ride to the Sabaody Archipelago.

47
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,060
--What?! By our pirate ship?
--Sorry to be a pain!

48
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,980
Rest well tonight to prepare for tomorrow.

49
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,820
I can't wait to get off this island tomorrow!

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,640
I really wanna see everybody soon!

51
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,320
Really. What a strange man.

52
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,240
Sonia! Mari!

53
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,920
Invite Luffy to tonight's banquet!

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,510
--A man to our banquet?!
--Big Sis, that's too...

55
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,840
--Didn't you understand what I said?
--Y-Yes...

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,780
What banquet?

57
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,200
It's a banquet to celebrate the Kuja
Pirates' safe return with a big haul.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,360
You got any food at this banquet?

59
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,030
I haven't been to one in
a while! Yes!! A banquet!

60
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,810
Are you gonna come, too?

61
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,500
No, I'm a little tired.

62
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,540
I'll go to bed early.

63
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,150
Okay. You'll give me a ride and food.

64
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,120
I can't hardly believe it!

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,090
Doesn't he mean he can hardly believe it?

66
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,420
Banquet! Banquet! Banquet!

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,980
I didn't think that Snake Princess
would trust him this much.

68
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,150
I like you!

69
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,670
It's dinner time!! A banquet!!

70
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm gonna eat!!

71
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,830
This tastes great!

72
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,740
This one's good, too!

73
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,220
There's a lot of good food!
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,390
Then, I'll eat yours,
alright? Oh, you guys, too.

75
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,340
That man saved our lives.

76
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,660
I heard he'll leave tomorrow morning.

77
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,810
Men's bodies are strange as the rumors said.

78
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,720
I saw it at the arena. They can
stretch their legs really long!

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,920
I wanna get my hands on Luffy-sama
to see how much he can stretch.

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,540
--"Luffy-sama"?
--That's his name.

81
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,600
Oh, Luffy-sama!

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,020
Watch your mouth!

83
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
It's unthinkable to address
a man in such a way.

84
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,150
Don't forget the rule of Amazon Lily!

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,240
Then, why is Luffy-sama here?

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,700
Right?

87
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,250
Why is a man who once got the
death sentence here, Ran?

88
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,570
And of all places, our celebration!

89
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,790
I can't believe that Snake
Princess has forgiven him.

90
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,220
Maybe, it's...

91
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,270
...a trap laid by Snake Princess.

92
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,300
A trap?

93
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,430
He surprised them at the arena by putting
up a fight so she wants him to eat a lot

94
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,130
and catch him off guard and give him hell.

95
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,390
So it's our role to give him hell, right?

96
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,120
Are you ready?

97
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,460
Let's take care of the man!

98
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,050
Wait!

99
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,380
He's starting to act strange.

100
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,900
Oh, no! Did he notice?

101
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,800
Hey! Screw you people!!

102
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,830
That's enough!!

103
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,670
He sensed the trap!

104
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,780
Maybe he wants to fight us
with the pan and the ladle.

105
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,020
That sounds like something
that stupid man would do.

106
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,360
Don't get beaten!

107
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,760
Why aren't you singing?!

108
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,070
What are you doing?

109
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,420
Look, you people! This is
how you have a banquet!

110
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,810
Yo ho ho ho… Yo ho ho ho…

111
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,760
Yo ho ho ho… Yo ho ho ho…

112
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,720
Gather up all of the crew!
Time to ship out Binks's Brew!

113
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,620
Sea wind blows to where, who knows?
The waves will be our guide!

114
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,760
O'er across the ocean's tide,
the sunset is goin' wild

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,960
See the sky! Birds singing
in circles passing by!

116
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,990
--What's that?
--Men are funny!

117
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,120
It's funnier than Sweetpea's drunk dance!

118
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,040
I hate to admit it, but I can't top this.

119
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,800
Sailing out on our journey
to the ends of the sea!

120
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,010
Hey! Yo ho ho ho… Yo ho ho ho…

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,390
Yo ho ho ho…

122
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,960
Why can't you get it? It's like this!

123
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Like this! This!

124
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,150
This!

125
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,110
Is it like this?

126
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,710
That's so funny, Luffy-sama!

127
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,990
Men stick chopsticks in their nasal cavities
to their mouth

128
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,120
and hold baskets in their hand...

129
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,170
What a classless dance!

130
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,000
Gum-Gum Belly-talk!

131
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,770
Here! This is the specialty of Maiden Island!

132
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,320
What? Specialty?

133
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,250
Penne gorgonzola with Sea King meat.

134
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,090
I often eat Sea King meat
but this is different!

135
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,190
It really does stretch!

136
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,090
It's soft like gum!

137
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,520
Your time's up!

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,590
--What? One more time!
--No, then you won't stop!

139
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,890
Wow, this Sea King meat is
very good! It's hard to eat...

140
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,260
W-W-What are you doing - picking
and stretching my body?!

141
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,570
We can't help it! You'll
leave tomorrow, right?

142
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,410
There are a lot of people who
want to touch you just one time.

143
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,830
--It's taking too long! I wanna touch him now!
--Me, too!

144
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:53,340
"20 gol per touch"

145
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,170
--You're so popular!
--Luffy-chan!

146
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,340
You can't do business using
me without asking me!!

147
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,510
Come on, Luffy-chan! Tonight is
our only chance to touch a man!

148
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,910
Hey! S-Stop, you people!
I can't eat! Hey! Hey!

149
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,360
Where's Margaret?

150
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,560
--Where did Luffy-sama go?
--No! He ran away!

151
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,070
He can't have gotten too far!
Let's find him and touch him!

152
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,910
What's the matter with them?

153
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,370
Keep hiding!

154
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,210
This is only food that I could bring.

155
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,380
It's great that you can
return to your friends!

156
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,050
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that
I got you into some trouble.

157
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,220
I worried when you turned into stone!

158
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,690
But you protected us, right?

159
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,820
I heard what happened.

160
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,320
Thank you, Luffy!

161
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,000
What's wrong with Big Sis?

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,840
She hasn't eaten anything and while she
said she's tired, she also can't sleep.

163
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,050
The forcing assemble thing
is maybe bothering her.

164
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,270
Tomorrow morning...

165
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,700
Big Sis!

166
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,750
--Granny Nyon!
--What's the matter, Margaret?

167
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,930
Luffy's been chased by girls of the village.

168
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,140
No wonder. They don't see men often.

169
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,760
Hey, Granny Bean!

170
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,180
This part of the village is
secluded. Stay here for a while.

171
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,640
And my name's not Bean!!

172
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,270
He has something to eat, so just
bring him tea or something.

173
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,070
Okay.

174
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,740
Granny, you like to read newspapers, huh?

175
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,700
Coo News isn't delivered to a Calm Belt

176
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,700
so it's hard to get it but since our
empress is a Warlord of the Sea,

177
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,000
I have to know what's going
on in the world at least.

178
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,710
Who's a Warlord of the Sea?

179
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,960
Snake Princess.

180
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,810
Wh...

181
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,920
What?!

182
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,930
She's a Warlord of the Sea?

183
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,620
Does that mean she's
really strong in a fight?

184
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,930
You are a pirate.
Didn't you notice it?

185
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,400
N-No, I didn't.

186
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,020
Don't you read newspapers?

187
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,320
No, I don't read them.

188
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,810
Oh, what a shock!

189
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,720
Snake Princess became
empress of this country

190
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,590
and a captain of the
Kuja Pirates 11 years ago.

191
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,960
She was young but

192
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,290
they put a price of 80 million on
her head after her first expedition.

193
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,500
Just one?

194
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,720
It had to do with the bad reputation
Kuja had even before her.

195
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,640
The World Government became
cautious about her from the start

196
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,310
and they suggested that she become
one of the Seven Warlords.

197
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,690
But now, that title is about to be revoked.

198
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,650
Because...

199
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,650
W-What?!

200
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,860
The Seven Warlords and Navy Headquarters

201
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,700
are gonna fight
the Whitebeard Pirates?!

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,230
What's that?! What'll happen?!
W-W-W-W-Wait a minute!

203
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,540
T-This is too much to hear at once!

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,090
What a foolish man!
You don't know anything.

205
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,850
I must say, that was just a prediction.

206
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,680
But the battle will probably happen.

207
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,650
The World Government has made a move.

208
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,850
Whitebeard is a man who would never
allow his mates to be killed.

209
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,080
Even though they know this, they
announced the public execution of...

210
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,200
...Portgaz D. Ace, a great
commander of Whitebeard's.

211
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,120
They announced the public execution of...

212
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,310
...Portgaz D. Ace, a great
commander of Whitebeard's.

213
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,890
What's wrong?

214
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,810
Of who?

215
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,400
Ace. "Fire Fist" Ace.

216
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,820
Ace... is gonna get executed?

217
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,790
I heard a pirate called Blackbeard...

218
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,750
...became a Warlord by
defeating "Fire Fist" Ace.

219
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,510
Blackbeard...

220
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:37,350
The World Government will take full
advantage of this big fish they've caught,

221
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,390
--a pirate named Ace...
--Granny...

222
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,730
Granny!!

223
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,330
That's my brother!

224
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,900
Ace is my older brother!

225
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,020
What?!

226
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,980
Is that true?! He's your brother?!

227
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,200
I didn't know that he was captured.

228
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,410
And he's gonna be executed?!
Then, there's no chance for him to escape!

229
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,590
If Whitebeard wins this battle,
there will be a chance for him.

230
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,420
What should I do? Where are
they gonna execute him?

231
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,130
It'll take place Marinford's town square,

232
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,970
where Navy Headquarters stands.

233
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,600
It says "in one week," which
means 6 days from today.

234
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,680
What?! That's too soon!

235
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,440
How long will it take to get to
Sabaody Archipelago from here?

236
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,360
It will take more than a week.

237
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,360
If it takes that long, then Ace will
be finished before I meet my crew!

238
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,780
Then how long will it take
to get to where Ace is?

239
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,210
Impel Down is where he locked, and
it'll take a week by a pirate ship

240
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,390
and 4 days by a navy ship.

241
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,340
Why?! Navy ships are that fast?

242
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,630
There's a current used exclusively
by the World Government.

243
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,680
Enies Lobby.

244
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Impel Down.

245
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,350
Navy Headquarters.

246
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,640
There's a giant whirlpool which
connects those three facilities.

247
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,680
When you open the Gate of Justice
at any of the three facilities,

248
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,990
the current runs inside
allowing you to enter.

249
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,160
That means if the gates aren't open,
you'd just keep drifting on the current.

250
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,580
Pirate ships would rather avoid the current

251
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,040
by going a long way round.

252
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
What should I do?

253
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,810
What do you want to do?

254
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,950
Don't tell me that's your
brother's Vivre Card!

255
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,310
Oh, is it the sheet that moves
around that you care about so much?

256
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,720
That's a different one.

257
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,690
This is the one that Ace gave to me.

258
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,140
That's also known as a paper of life.

259
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,870
It tells you a direction in which the
person is and about their vital energy.

260
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,410
So, if it's that small, it means...

261
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,080
When I got it, it was ten times bigger.

262
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,830
Ace has his own adventure...

263
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,640
I wanted you to have it. Here.

264
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,100
Always hang on to that.

265
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,270
Huh? It's just a scrap of paper.

266
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,860
That scrap of paper will bring you
and me together again sometime.

267
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,770
You don't want it?

268
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,110
No, I'll keep it.

269
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,110
It's natural for a big brother to worry...

270
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,280
...about his bungling kid brother.

271
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,460
Ace won't like me rescuing him
since he's stronger.

272
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,770
But...

273
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm sorry, everybody.

274
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,950
I'm gonna take a little side trip.

275
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,190
I wanna go and rescue Ace!

276
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,410
Do you know for sure

277
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,290
how reckless it would be and how
big this battle is going to be?

278
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,040
You'll be like an ant blown into a storm.

279
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,150
You can just be flicked away
without even having done anything.

280
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,720
I don't care what's gonna
happen! I just wanna go!

281
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,640
I can't just sit by calmly on the
sidelines and let this happen!

282
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,520
I see.

283
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,230
So you're going to rescue the most
infamous prisoner in the world now.

284
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,690
If there is a chance in a million,

285
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,490
you better go to the Great
Prison where he's being held.

286
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,080
When they move him to the
execution ground in Marinford,

287
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,830
the navy admirals and the Seven
Warlords will be keeping a close eye.

288
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,590
However, because your brother is now
the most important prisoner they have,

289
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:28,190
there is no doubt that they're guarding the
prison with the military's full strength.

290
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,010
So it's impossible to enter.

291
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,730
I care more about getting there in
time than what happens after.

292
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,190
I got to get there while Ace is there.

293
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,610
Just give me a big oar,
and I'll paddle myself...

294
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,590
Wait a second! You can't
get there on will alone.

295
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,320
This is a slim chance, too, but...

296
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,530
Snake Princess refuses to follow the order to
force the Seven Warlords of the Sea to assemble.

297
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,790
If only she obeys the order,

298
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,830
we can take advantage of it
and let you on their ship.

299
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,340
Their ship? There's a navy ship here?!

300
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,270
Then I'm gonna go and ask her!

301
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,620
Granny Nyon!

302
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,420
What's wrong, Enishida? Why
are you in such a hurry?

303
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,860
Thank god. I was going to come get you.

304
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,350
What happened?

305
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,450
Well...

306
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,320
...Snake Princess...

307
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,750
...has come down with an unknown illness.

308
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,460
--She's sick?!
--Oh my god!

309
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,140
Big Sis!

310
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
Am I...

311
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,280
Am I...

312
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,990
...going to die?

313
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,830
Hancock has fallen ill.

314
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:28,010
Granny Nyon tells the whole gang
about this terrifying illness,

315
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,760
which has killed previous
empresses of Amazon Lily.

316
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,850
What could this illness be?

317
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,440
