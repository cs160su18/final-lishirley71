2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,460
Luffy is trying to break free
in order to go after Ace

50
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,100
but Warden Magellan is in his way!

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,820
Into the water?! Go ahead
and dive if you want!

52
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,160
There are Sea Kings' nests everywhere!

53
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,760
Hell's Judgement!

54
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,590
Gum-Gum...

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,430
...Giant Stamp!

56
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,760
Hell...

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,360
...Wink!

58
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,490
I won't allow!

59
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,750
What's this?!

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,030
You made it!

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,010
I'm sorry that I should ask you
to come to this dangerous area!

62
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,730
--It's a school of whale sharks!
--Jimbei must have called them!

63
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,900
Cool!

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,530
"Come, Final Miracle! Break
Through the Gate of Justice!"

65
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,500
Carry them here!

66
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,310
That guy's so cool!

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,700
--Cool!
--Heehaw!

68
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,550
Yo-ho!

69
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,940
Yeah! We made it to the Navy ship!

70
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,630
We broke out!

71
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,780
I can't believe that we
escaped from Impel Down!

72
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,990
It's not time to celebrate yet!
We have to get going!

73
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,380
Yeah!

74
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,380
Thank you, whale sharks!

75
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,030
I appreciate it!

76
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,130
--See you!
--Thank you so much!

77
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,010
Get home safely!

78
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,130
I'll start treating Inazuma.

79
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,270
Bring all the medicines
from the clinic!

80
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,480
Alright!

81
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,140
I'm never going back into that hell again!

82
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,320
Me, neither! I'm gonna reform my
ways and go back to my family!

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,870
We're free now!

84
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,080
Thanks to who?

85
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,710
Say it!

86
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,290
Captain Buggy!

87
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,380
I can't believe that they made it that far.

88
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,380
Is this the Navy? Bring me a ship!

89
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,140
I'll ride it and bring them down myself!

90
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,090
Yes, sir!

91
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:39,360
They don't realize that after
all they are still trapped.

92
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,980
There is nothing but despair ahead for you!

93
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,320
You can't get away no
matter how you struggle!

94
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,740
Rear Admiral! We fixed the battery
that was damaged by Jimbei!

95
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,840
Good.

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,620
All ships, open fire!

97
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,840
Buggy!

98
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,350
Range correction!

99
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,320
They started firing!

100
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,240
--This is no good!
--How many ships are there?!

101
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,870
The fleet is coming after us!

102
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,710
They got us!

103
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,050
Even though everybody ranked higher than
Vice Admiral has been summoned to Marineford,

104
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,340
the Navy ships are still
formidable without them!

105
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,900
Can't you see that it's no
use? For pirates like you...

106
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,520
...The Gate of Justice won't open!

107
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,780
Oh no! I forgot about this!

108
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh my God! We can't open it!

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,620
Damn! It's a dead end after coming this far!

110
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,420
You're talking like me!

111
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,710
--What're we gonna do, you shark?!
--Sail through it!

112
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,670
That's impossible! This is a disaster!

113
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,590
How can you be so relaxed?!

114
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,060
Say something!

115
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,860
Protect the ship first! That's our priority!

116
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,580
Why are we just taking their
fire?! This is a Navy ship, too!

117
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,120
--Fire back, you dumb-asses!
--That was my idea!

118
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,330
We have to fire back, guys!

119
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,540
We see, Captain Buggy!

120
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,430
Sables!

121
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,140
Gum-Gum...

122
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,680
...Balloon!

123
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,090
How's that?!

124
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,850
Fire!

125
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,580
It's impossible for us to outrun them!

126
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,050
Dammit! If nothing is done, the
Navy will get us eventually!

127
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,550
Damn prisoners!

128
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,930
Why are they still heading to the
gate knowing that they're cornered?

129
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,060
The gate can only be controlled
from inside of Impel Down.

130
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,360
There is no other way to open it!

131
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,190
Keep firing! Sink them...

132
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,780
The Gate of Justice is opening!

133
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,660
Why?! What's going on?! Why
are they opening the gate?!

134
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,540
It's open!

135
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,630
W-Why is this happening?

136
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,970
Is this a trap?!

137
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,640
Yes! I don't know why
but the gate is opening!

138
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,180
It's open! It's open!

139
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,690
What?!

140
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,360
Warden Magellan! Please hurry!

141
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,490
No! Wait!

142
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,450
No way!

143
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,250
Why is the gate opening?!

144
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,960
Are you sure about opening the gate?

145
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,420
Warden Magellan!

146
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,930
I'm sure! Have I ever been wrong?!

147
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,310
No, it's not like I don't believe you!

148
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,640
After the prisoners' ship passes through,

149
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,100
close the gate right away, understood?

150
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,850
I got it, sir!

151
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,110
Don't let them get away!
They aren't allowed to! Fire!

152
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,620
Is it Magellan's order?!
What is he thinking?!

153
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,290
Why is he doing this?!
What happened to Warden?!

154
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,630
Yes, um, but it doesn't
look like his will to me!

155
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,710
He was at the pier near the
main entrance just while ago!

156
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,430
Why is this? What's happening here?!

157
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,440
Control room! What are you doing?!

158
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,840
Who told you to open the gate?!

159
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,480
W-Warden!

160
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,610
Oh no!

161
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,120
Is that true?

162
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,500
Bon-chan is...

163
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,170
You bastard!

164
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,920
That's right!

165
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,890
It's me!

166
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,090
I got you again!

167
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,470
He's an imposter!

168
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,460
Warden, I just heard from the lookout!

169
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,560
The stolen ship will pass the gate soon!

170
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,730
--Even if they get through the gate...
--Spin, spin!

171
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,690
--they can't outrun that many ships!
--Spin, spin!

172
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,780
--It's impossible!
--Spin, spin!

173
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,490
Then, close the gate now! Push the button!

174
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,270
W-What?!

175
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,580
Oh, yes, sir! Um...

176
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,290
No, don't push it!

177
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,790
Okay!

178
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,120
--No, push it!
--Don't push it!

179
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,920
--Push it!
--Don't!

180
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,890
--Push it!
--Don't!

181
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,550
--Push it!
--Don't!

182
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,160
--Push it!
--Don't!

183
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,690
--Push it!
--Don't!

184
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,250
--Push it!
--Don't!

185
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,300
--Push it now!
--Yes, sir!

186
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,570
Memoirs of a Desert Kingdom!

187
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,650
Heehaw! I win!

188
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,770
Y-You bastard!

189
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,990
I'm not gonna let you go after Straw-chan!

190
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,130
Look! The gate is closing!

191
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,020
Yes! If we can get through it,
the Navy will be stopped by it!

192
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,020
I was with him at the entrance a while ago!

193
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,860
He stayed alone at Impel Down?!

194
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,490
We made it this far at
last! We're almost there!

195
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,500
Because of Bon-chan, we met Ivan-chan
and broke out successfully!

196
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,210
And we're gonna go on without him?!

197
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,960
We don't have time!

198
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Are we gonna leave him there?!

199
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,220
We already left hundreds
of friends who were beaten!

200
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,840
Do you want to go back and fight Magellan?!

201
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,100
And lose more friends and time?!

202
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,410
To be able to open this gate, we
needed somebody to stay there!

203
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,400
I can do it better than anyone! I'm
gonna open the Gate of Justice!

204
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,740
What are you gonna do after that?!

205
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,580
What a pointless question!

206
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,170
Don't tell Straw-chan until
communications are cut off!

207
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,500
Us queers...

208
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,590
...we don't say goodbye!

209
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,600
It's still connected.

210
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,980
A Baby Transponder Snail's
coverage is limited.

211
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,390
It won't work after the gate closes.

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,450
No, I can't control the
switching device of the gate!

213
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,320
It's impossible to fix it in time, Warden!

214
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,410
You dared to turn into
the Warden, of all men?

215
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,620
I'm glad that I memorized
your face at that time!

216
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,390
Wake up, Hannyabal! What happened here?!

217
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,340
W-Warden! Please let go of me!

218
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,470
Touch!

219
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,750
Damn you!

220
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,140
Bon-chan!

221
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,060
Straw-chan!

222
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,310
Hey, can you hear me, Bon-chan?!

223
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,560
Why are you doing this?!

224
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,980
Just like you did in the past!

225
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,080
Bon Clay-sama!

226
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,580
Running now wouldn't be like a queer...

227
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,330
If we abandon pals who would risk
their lives to pick up their pal,

228
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,960
will we... be able to
enjoy our food tomorrow?!

229
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,840
Listen, guys... Straw Hats too!

230
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,800
Listen to what I have to say carefully!

231
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,310
Am I the Straw Hat you guys're looking for?!

232
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,530
Just kidding!

233
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,530
Miss Hina! The sheep ship
is heading to the east!

234
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,910
You were tricked, weren't you!

235
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,830
We're experts at disguising ourselves! And...

236
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,210
we're the Straw Hats' friends...!

237
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,330
Bring it on!

238
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,720
Why are you doing this?!

239
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,560
Like you did in the past!

240
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,680
Jimbei, you promised me
that you wouldn't tell him!

241
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,480
Not until communications were cut off!

242
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,070
We were gonna break out
together, weren't we?!

243
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,780
How many times have I been saved by you?!

244
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,120
If you are there, say something, Bon-chan!

245
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,870
That was it?! That queer...

246
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,330
...stayed there alone to save us!

247
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,130
--Bon-chan!
--Brother Bon, say something!

248
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,500
Why aren't you answering?!

249
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,480
Bon-chan!

250
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,350
Mr. 2!

251
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,430
Mr. 2! How dare you!

252
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,020
I'm sorry about everything!

253
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,620
-- Bon boy!
-- Fire!

254
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Don't let them get away!

255
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,280
Break them into pieces!

256
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,570
Bon-chan!

257
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,660
Bon-chan!

258
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,000
Bon-chan, the gate's closing.

259
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,460
We...

260
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,460
...have to go.

261
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,600
Thank you!

262
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,520
Brother Bon, thank you!

263
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,820
--Thank you!
--Thank you!

264
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,790
Straw-chan!

265
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,450
--Bon-chan!
--Straw-chan!

266
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,080
You gotta save your brother at any cost!

267
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,140
I know that you can save
your brother for sure!

268
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,890
Bon-chan!

269
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,690
--The gate is closing!
--We gotta sink them!

270
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,700
It's been a long time!

271
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,860
I'm more than fine now!

272
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,660
Gimme a break!

273
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,790
Straw-chan!

274
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,090
I come to rescue you!

275
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,310
In the name of friendship!

276
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,640
Hang in there!

277
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,970
Straw-chan! Hang in there!

278
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,990
Us queers...

279
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,160
...we don't say goodbye!

280
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,240
--Bon-chan!
--Brother Bon!

281
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,160
I can't believe this!

282
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,870
We let them get away!

283
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,430
If it weren't for him, we would...

284
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,250
We would've sunk in the
water inside the gate!

285
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:10,850
The flower of friendship blooms even in hell.

286
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,560
On the sand where waves come and go,

287
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,850
it leaves its petal as a memento.

288
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,740
We will make it bloom again
someday, the Oh Come My Way!

289
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,490
--Bon-chan!
--Brother Bon!

290
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,490
Bon boy!

291
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,240
Mr. 2!

292
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,550
Do you wanna say something before you die?!

293
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,720
This is what I wanted!

294
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,970
We'll meet again in the
garden of Oh Come My Way...

295
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,340
At this time,

296
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,590
the number of prisoners who escaped from the
greatest underwater prison, Impel Down...

297
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,020
...has increased to 241 in total!

298
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,570
This is the biggest gaffe in the history of
Impel Down

299
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,500
but the ordeal is not over yet.

300
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,990
The public execution of
Portgaz D. Ace is in...

301
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,610
...4 hours!

302
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,800
Luffy and the others say farewell
to Bon Clay and set sail.

303
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,380
But when Buggy learns that they're
headed for the Navy Headquarters,

304
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,470
he and the other prisoners plan a
mutiny to commandeer the Navy ship.

305
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,680
Then, still more shocking news from
the Navy Headquarters reaches them...

306
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,020
"To the Navy Headquarters!
Off to Rescue Ace!"

308
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,180
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
