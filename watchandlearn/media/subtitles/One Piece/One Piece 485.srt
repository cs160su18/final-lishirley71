2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,220
"Ending the Matter! Whitebeard
vs. The Blackbeard Pirates!"

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,640
Shiryu! You bastard!

50
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,340
What happened to Magellan?

51
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,600
What's going on at Impel Down?

52
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,900
How did you guys get here?

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,460
I think the fact that we're here is the
answer to your questions,

54
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,900
don't you think?

55
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,770
Fleet Admiral Sengoku-san?

56
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,800
If you wanna know more, why don't
you check it yourself later.

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,990
Anyway, I've allied with these guys.

58
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,970
Remember that from now on!

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,440
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

60
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,650
I didn't have a chance to tell you but...

61
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,450
...I got a report that the Gates
of Justice have opened again

62
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,910
and an unidentified ship
passed through a while ago!

63
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,450
That must've been them!

64
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,270
But the control room is under Navy control

65
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,080
and I didn't hear about
any unusual circumstances!

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,090
How did they get here?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,800
That's quite simple.

69
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,430
Before we, the Blackbeard
Pirates, set off for Impel Down,

70
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,690
I hypnotized the Navy soldiers
in the control room...

71
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,320
...to open the Gates of Justice
for any Navy ship that approaches.

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,030
It turns out that it helped the others too.

73
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,320
Straw Hat and the others?

74
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,030
If I were regarded as an
enemy by the Government,

75
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,170
the Gates of Justice won't open

76
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,550
for me and I couldn't have
sneaked into Impel Down!

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,500
That's why I wanted the
title of The Seven Warlords!

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,960
But I don't need it anymore!

79
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,800
So you just wanted to free your crew members!

80
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,430
Yes, indeed! That's all I
wanted from the beginning!

81
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,230
And that's all that matters!

82
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,360
You'll see why!

83
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't give a damn about any of this!

84
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,840
Teach!

85
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,060
Look out! Captain!

86
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,840
That was close! That was close!
We had a narrow escape!

87
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,190
You have no mercy, huh?! Of course you don't!

88
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,820
You're the only one that I
refuse to call my son, Teach!

89
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:23,500
You broke the one and only iron rule
on my ship and you killed your mate!

90
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,300
I will avenge the 4th
division commander--Thatch

91
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,460
by taking this fool's life
thereby ending the matter!

92
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,670
Pops!

93
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,230
Marco!

94
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,770
Pops!

95
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,700
Keep yourself out of this!

96
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,070
Pops!

97
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,670
Do you hear me?!

98
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,550
Let's get it over with, Teach!

99
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,090
I'm looking forward to it!

100
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,640
What is that black stuff
coming out of his body?

101
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,280
Smoke?!

102
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,040
Black Hole!

103
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,590
This is the power of the Devil Fruit
that I stole from Thatch by killing him!

104
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:05,600
The most dominant Dark-Dark Fruit!
Enjoy it to the fullest extent!

105
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,160
Hey, Pops! Thatch died
and then Ace died, too!

106
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,580
I looked up to you and longed
to be like you but you got old!

107
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,710
You can't even save your man
from getting killed now!

108
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,210
I tried not to kill Ace at
the Banaro Island for you!

109
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,430
That bastard!

110
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,560
Oh no no, it's no use!

111
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,560
There's no Devil Fruit power
that works against me!

112
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,360
Vortex!

113
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,700
Do you like my darkness, Pops?!

114
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,170
It drags in and nullifies even
the powers of Devil Fruits!

115
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,760
Which means you can't create
earthquakes anymore!

116
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,930
I can't believe Pops got hit like that!

117
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,100
Oops!

118
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,690
Don't you get it yet?!

119
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,630
How do you like my power?!

120
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,700
It's no use!

121
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,000
What a poor sport, Pops!

122
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,100
Ouch! Damn!

123
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,420
It hurts!

124
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,510
Arrogance, thoughtlessness...
Those are your weaknesses!

125
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,410
Hey, don't!

126
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,990
Pops, don't!

127
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,410
I'm your son!

128
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,120
How can you kill me...?

129
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,100
You did it! Pops!

130
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,020
No, look at that!

131
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,330
Damn! I can't believe it! He's tough!

132
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,000
A final blow! Give him a final blow, Pops!

133
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,750
--Just one more hit!
--Finish him off!

134
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,560
Pops!

135
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,140
Pops! What's wrong?!

136
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,480
He isn't moving!

137
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,830
I don't think he's frozen by choice!

138
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,460
On top of his worsening health,

139
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,420
he's taking a lot of damage
from all this fierce fighting!

140
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,510
Pops' body is already beyond...!

141
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,490
Y-You damn monster!

142
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,990
You useless old man!

143
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,960
Shut up and die!

144
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,720
Pops!!

145
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,480
Kill him, guys!

146
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,000
Pops!!

147
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,390
Shoot him! Riddle him with bullets!

148
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,150
Pops!

149
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,520
Pops!

150
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,480
Pops!

151
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,830
Did you say that you're
gonna die soon, Roger?

152
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,540
Yeah, it's only a matter of time.

153
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,420
Do you want me to tell you how
to get to Raftel, Whitebeard?

154
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,970
I'm not gonna go there anyway
because I've no interest.

155
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,020
Do you know what people of the World
Government call me these days?

156
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,610
"Gold Roger."

157
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,610
What? Is that your real name?

158
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,400
No, no!

159
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,830
My name is Gol D. Roger.

160
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,950
I meet people with "D"
in their names sometimes.

161
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,750
I have a crew member who
has it. His name is Teach.

162
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,510
What does "D" stand for?

163
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,300
Ah, do you wanna know that?

164
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,640
Alright, I tell you.

165
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,440
It's a story from way back...

166
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,620
Whoa, I'm out of bullets!
Hey, give me another gun!

167
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,700
You don't need it!

168
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,200
Whitebeard is unconscious now!

169
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,170
He's gonna collapse if you
push him with your finger!

170
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,500
It's not you!

171
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,260
You're still alive?!

172
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,060
The man that Roger is waiting for...

173
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:26,230
...is not you, Teach, at any rate!

174
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,780
Like there are people who
will inherit Roger's will,

175
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,100
some people inherit Ace's
sometime in the future!

176
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,500
Even if you break their blood bond,

177
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,250
you'll
never be able to extinguish their flame!

178
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:52,350
That's how it came down
unbroken throughout the ages!

179
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,870
And someday in the future,

180
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,970
carrying hundreds of years
of history on his shoulder,

181
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,060
someone will fling down the
gauntlet in front of the world!

182
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,110
Sengoku! You and the World
Government are afraid of...

183
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:25,080
...the gigantic war that will
embroil the whole world in one day!

184
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,040
I've no interest in it but...

185
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:38,510
...when someone finds the treasure,
the world will turn upside down!

186
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,850
And I'm sure somebody will find it!

187
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,040
And that day will come!

188
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,860
The One Piece...

189
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,820
...is real!!

190
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,710
You bastard!

191
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,550
What great last words!

192
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,600
--Pops!
--Pops!

193
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,600
Pops...

194
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,360
Forgive me, my sons.

195
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,200
I raised such a ridiculous fool.

196
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,990
You guys gave me everything.

197
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,120
This is it for me.

198
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,520
I've been traveling a very long time.

199
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,810
Let's sail out!

200
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,640
It was a great voyage!

201
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,080
That's odd! What kind of pirate
doesn't have interest in treasures?

202
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,290
What is it that you want?

203
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,430
Hey, Newgate!

204
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,140
There is something that I've
wanted since I was a kid.

205
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,890
Oh, you have something?
Why don't you tell us?

206
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,700
A family.

207
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,950
"A family?" What is he talking about?!

208
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,320
I have deep appreciation.

209
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,450
Goodbye, my sons!

210
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,960
Good old man...

211
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,940
He-He died...

212
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,300
...standing!

213
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,080
Whitebeard passed away!

214
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,080
Although he's dead, his
body doesn't collapse!

215
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,660
And the way he mowed down enemies
with wounds all over his body...

216
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,580
...was certainly monstrous!

217
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,800
The number of sword wounds he
received in this war is indeed 267!

218
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,350
The number of gun wounds: 152!

219
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,100
And he was shot by a cannon 46 times!

220
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,310
Yet,

221
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,270
on his proud back...

222
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,920
...or in his whole pirate life,

223
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,280
there is no scar that he
got while running away!

224
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,820
The Navy sweeps in to

225
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,970
wipe out the pirates as the loss
of Whitebeard slows their retreat,

226
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,250
and Akainu stands once again in
front of the unconscious Luffy.

227
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,630
Meanwhile, Blackbeard prepares to reveal

228
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,600
what he's really plotting to the whole world!

229
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,920
On the next episode of One Piece!

230
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,190
"The Show Begins! Blackbeard's
Plot is Revealed!"

231
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
