00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,130
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,210
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,660
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

9
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

10
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,490
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

11
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,820
After landing on Punk Hazard;

12
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,440
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen,

13
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,570
the Straw Hats learned about
the hideous experiments

14
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,340
performed by Caesar Clown, the Master,

15
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,470
and headed off to investigate.

16
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,700
What?

17
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,160
An alliance?

18
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,210
I have a plan...

19
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,620
...to bring down one of the Four Emperors!

20
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,070
"Formed! Luffy and Law's Pirate Alliance!"

21
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,770
An alliance?

22
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,230
Are you saying that if we work together,
we can take down an Emperor?

23
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,440
How absurd!

24
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,410
I don't know what he wants but don't
listen to this jerk's fast-talk, Luffy!

25
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,470
I'm not saying we can beat
the Emperor straight away.

26
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,090
All I'm saying is we'd get a chance
if we advance the plan step by step.

27
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,500
What do you say, Straw Hat-ya?

28
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,760
Which of the Four Emperors
are you talking about?

29
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,720
Hey Luffy, why are you interested?!

30
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,390
We can't trust this guy!

31
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,280
The Emperor's name is...

32
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,350
I see.

33
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,220
Okay, let's do it!

34
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
What?!

35
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,050
What?!!

36
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,320
THE STRAW HATS' ENCAMPMENT

37
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,320
What?!

38
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,120
We're gonna form an alliance
with the Heart Pirates?!

39
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,500
You just went out to reclaim Nami!

40
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,920
So how did you come back with
such an eccentric idea?!

41
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,010
Listen...

42
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,500
If we ally ourselves with this
creep who gives me the chills,

43
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,510
I won't be able to sleep in peace at night!

44
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,900
See, Luffy? Everybody's against it.

45
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,060
Let's not do it. It's too risky.

46
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,400
We wanna travel at our own pace.

47
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,710
She's right, Luffy!

48
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,580
Besides, it's too early to even
think about the Four Emperors!

49
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,180
We can't fight them yet!

50
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,030
Hey, treat this racoon.

51
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,620
Forget about some racoon now!

52
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,400
Huh?

53
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,700
What?!

54
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,810
It's me!

55
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,910
Z-Zuber...

56
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,580
What happened?! My body!

57
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,270
Luffy.

58
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,670
I'm gonna go along with your decision

59
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,090
but alliances between pirates
are often marked by betrayal.

60
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,920
Maybe it's dangerous for you
since you are so trusting.

61
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,500
Huh? Are you gonna betray me?

62
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,350
No.

63
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,940
Hey, have at least a little doubt!

64
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,650
Anyhow, a pirate alliance
sounds like fun, doesn't it?

65
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,110
I think Tra-guy is a good man but...

66
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,160
...even if he isn't, don't worry!

67
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,560
Because I have you guys who spent
the last two years training!

68
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,620
What?!

69
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,550
Luffy, you're...

70
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,880
D-Don't mention it! Luffy,
you're making me blush!

71
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,840
Yeah, I know we're zuper dependable but...

72
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,800
We just do what we got to do!

73
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,810
You're not flattering me, you fool!

74
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,020
A-Alright, Luffy! You can count on us!

75
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,020
If Zoro and the others wimp
out, I'll convince them!

76
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,950
I'm counting on you guys!

77
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,690
Room.

78
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,750
Shambles.

79
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,220
I got it back! My great body!

80
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,680
I knew I liked myself the best when I'm me!

81
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,890
Super!

82
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm happy for you, Franky!

83
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,900
Don't ever take Chopper's body again. Ever.

84
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,020
I'm...

85
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,430
...back to myself, too, but...

86
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,760
Why are there cuts and
bruises all over my body?!

87
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,820
What did you guys do to it?!

88
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,200
--I'm sorry. It's his fault.
--I'm sorry. It's his fault.

89
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Why?! You went out of
control in Chopper's body

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,950
so I had no choice but to stop you!

91
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,860
But you didn't have to use
the same technique you used

92
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,210
to beat the Kraken!

93
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,560
I blame both of you!

94
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,710
--I'm sorry!
--I'm sorry!

95
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,390
You should be happy just being
back to yourself, Chopper.

96
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,520
Why do I have to be in
someone else's body again?

97
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,090
First, it was Franky and now, Sanji-kun!

98
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,400
Nami became Sanji!

99
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,190
You're looking good!

100
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,280
It wouldn't be funny if it happened to you!

101
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,490
It can't be helped.

102
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,490
Chopper and Franky could

103
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,200
go back to themselves because
their bodies were here

104
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,250
but since Sanji went out looking
for the samurai in Nami's body,

105
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,170
you have no choice but take Sanji's body.

106
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,720
Can't you do something about it?!

107
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,800
I can't do anything without your body here.

108
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,010
These are the children?

109
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,270
Yeah, I wanna help them.

110
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,500
I'm giving them this drug candy everyday.

111
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,330
They're such a pain - just forget about them.

112
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,700
I heard they're drugged.

113
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,750
We know! Because I tested them!

114
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,060
I just wanna take them home

115
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,170
but it'll take a while for them to recover

116
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,670
and most importantly, they are so big.

117
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,430
Boy, I can't believe somebody's
doing such a horrendous experiment.

118
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,800
Turning people into giants is a
project that has been underway for

119
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,990
hundreds of years by the World Government.

120
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,240
The Government? For what purpose?

121
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,480
Military might, probably.

122
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,880
If they can produce an infinite
amount of giant soldiers,

123
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,610
they'll become invincible.

124
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,600
Caesar wants to achieve the goal first

125
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,210
and outsmart the Government and Vegapunk

126
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,550
but I don't think it's that easy.

127
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,290
Do you really wanna help them?

128
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,300
You don't even know who they are.

129
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,870
Yes, I do. Although I don't know them well,

130
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,500
they asked me to help
with tears in their eyes.

131
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,190
It seems like the Master tricked
them and brought them here

132
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,270
but they already know there is
something wrong with this place.

133
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,450
Until I know that they are safe,
I won't leave this island!

134
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,750
Are you willing to stay here alone?

135
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,290
I'm not gonna leave my friend behind.

136
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,710
If that's what Nami and
Chopper want, I want it, too.

137
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,970
And Sanji wants to stick the
samurai's body together.

138
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,260
You got to help us if you
wanna team up with us!

139
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,850
I thought so. You have no idea.

140
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,950
You think an alliance is...

141
00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:00,030
...a cooperative relationship just
for some common goal, don't you?

142
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,530
Of course, I do.

143
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,740
Listen. Luffy's idea of an alliance
is a little different from yours.

144
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,350
It's like being friends, isn't it?

145
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,530
If you're thinking of taking control,
it won't be that easy, either.

146
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,060
That's what they say.

147
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,590
Once he feels sure about
something, he won't back down.

148
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,550
It's a pain in the ass!

149
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,100
His selfishness is as formidable
as the Four Emperors.

150
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,550
That must be hard.

151
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,980
But what your friends want has
nothing to do with us at all...

152
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,690
Hey! Don't throw your booger at me, fool!

153
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,140
Oh, sorry!

154
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,730
I can't move right now!

155
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,820
Sorry, sorry!

156
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,160
Okay, I understand. There is not much time.

157
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,610
You guys have to take care of the samurai.

158
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll look into the drug
that the kids were taking.

159
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,370
Who is your ship's doctor?

160
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,210
He's got to come with me and help
me research it behind Caesar's back.

161
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,300
Okay, this is good.

162
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,720
I'm sorry but I can't walk
right now so, thanks!

163
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,230
D-Don't drop him, Tra-guy!

164
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,020
Sorry! I shouldn't laugh! But...

165
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,660
Super cute!

166
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,480
Good luck, Chopper.

167
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,530
Count on me!

168
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,950
THE BURNING LANDS

169
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,660
1, 2, 3!

170
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,210
1, 2, 3!

171
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,100
Alright, it's unlocked!

172
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,200
1, 2, 3!

173
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,030
What do they keep in this warehouse?

174
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,210
What's that?

175
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,680
I can't see. It's too dark.

176
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,020
What happened?

177
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,620
Are you mad?

178
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,440
As you can tell from the assassins earlier,

179
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,110
Caesar-ya wants to get rid of you
guys and White Chase-ya's G-5

180
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,760
and take back those children.

181
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,300
Until he gets what he wants,
he won't stop attacking.

182
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,440
He is a former Government scientist,

183
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,430
who became a criminal four years ago.

184
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,590
If the fact somebody is here on
this restricted island leaks out,

185
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,700
he will lose this perfect hiding place.

186
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,810
That's why he'll try to
kill you all at any cost.

187
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,500
A 300 million berry bounty.

188
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,440
A Logia-type Gas-Gas Fruit eater who owns

189
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,160
weapons of mass destruction.

190
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,080
That's who Caesar Clown is.

191
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,010
300 million?

192
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,900
Those of you who can't use
Haki, stay away from him.

193
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,630
He's not just a scientist.

194
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,410
Those who can use Haki among
us are me and Zoro and Sanji.

195
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,940
And you.

196
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,470
I think that's enough.

197
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,390
I'm gonna go back to the lab now.

198
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,190
So what we're gonna do is
kidnap the Master, right?

199
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,890
Yes, that's it.

200
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,310
But why should we kidnap him?

201
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,360
Money? I thought the
Master guy is their boss.

202
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,430
Who else can pay us a ransom?

203
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,290
We're not gonna do it for
money. Just to raise havoc.

204
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,500
--Havoc?
--What do you mean?

205
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,090
There's no point to tell you

206
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,550
what lies ahead before we
even kidnap him successfully.

207
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,920
Focus on capturing Caesar Clown for now.

208
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,680
It's not gonna be easy.

209
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,260
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

210
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,930
I'll tell you all the details
of my plan after that. However,

211
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,810
when we kidnap Caesar successfully,

212
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,860
things will start moving
whether you like it or not.

213
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,990
There will be no turning back.

214
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,160
This is the last chance
for you to reconsider.

215
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,540
That's okay. We're with you.

216
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,000
Then, I will go along with
what you guys want to do.

217
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,420
You need to convince the rest of your crew.

218
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,480
Yeah, I got it!

219
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,930
CAESAR CLOWN'S LABORATORY - THE FRONT

220
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,000
You bastard! Damn you creature!

221
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,310
"Rebar" Smoothie!

222
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,020
Fen Bock of the Gourd!

223
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,490
"Rope-Tugging" Chappe!

224
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,520
Smoker-san! They are former
prisoners as we thought!

225
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,790
Just looking a little different.

226
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,040
What's going on here?

227
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,800
Then why did they say none of the
prisoners survived four years ago?!

228
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,990
Smo-san, what are those people?!

229
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,350
How should I know?!

230
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,730
In any case, just hold them back!

231
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,320
We have to put the ship to sea...

232
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,780
...to make a report!

233
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,670
Shoot! Shoot!

234
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,370
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

235
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,380
Master, the Transponder Snail is ringing.

236
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,120
You don't have to take it.

237
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,800
They probably want to report
they opened the door.

238
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,400
"And something came out."

239
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,520
"It attacked our comrades. Help us."

240
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,770
They'll just go on like that. Quite annoying.

241
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,100
We don't often have this many visitors here.

242
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,490
You can stop gathering test subjects now.

243
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,740
What?

244
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,800
Hello?! Master?! Hello?!

245
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,980
Please come in!

246
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,900
We're in the Burning Lands! We
opened the door as you said!

247
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,350
No good! The Master is not picking up!

248
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,570
It's coming! What is that?!

249
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,150
It came out of the building!

250
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,790
It killed all of our comrades! Just run!

251
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,700
--Wh-Which way?!
--Th-This way!

252
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,200
What is that thing?! It's
bigger than a mountain!

253
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,290
It's coming! Help me!

254
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,080
Master!

255
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,230
Let me tell you about my pet.

256
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,550
It's a very rare slime-type creature.

257
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,840
Master...

258
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,310
No one...

259
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,770
...can leave this island!

260
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,070
How does it feel to be loose after so long,

261
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,900
Smiley?!

262
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,010
The ultimate weapon that Caesar created...

263
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,740
While its identity is slowly coming to light,

264
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,490
the Straw Hats make their move to capture Caesar.

265
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,060
However, Luffy's actions cause the
situation to go in an unexpected direction.

266
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

267
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,800
"Capture M!
The Pirate Alliance's Operation Launches!"

268
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
