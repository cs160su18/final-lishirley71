20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,410
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,510
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

75
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,530
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,300
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,230
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,820
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law

79
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,470
who's been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,260
Meanwhile, in the last battle of
the first round - Block D match...

81
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,750
He's acting strange!

82
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,790
He fell asleep?!

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
H-He's a sleepwalker?!

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,230
Yes-dara.

85
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,380
Hakuba is, indeed,

86
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,910
an alter-ego of Cavendish
that awakens while he is sleeping.

87
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,910
It's the finals next!

88
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,850
Who are you?

89
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,820
You're Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,020
Yes, I am!

91
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,950
Shut up!

92
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,320
I've been waiting for you.
I'll help you enter to the palace!

93
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,030
"The Admiral's Decision!
Fujitora vs. Doflamingo!"

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,260
Now, we're moving on to the finals!

95
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,550
But I have sad news!

96
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,580
The four executives who were
going to fight in the finals

97
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,420
had to withdraw from the competition.

98
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,310
What?!

99
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,200
I was expecting to see
the hard-boiled Señor!

100
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,230
I've wanted to see Lao G.!

101
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,690
What about Vise's "Da-in"?!

102
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,670
I've wanted to see Dellinger's "High Heel"!

103
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,580
But don't worry!

104
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,740
Believe or not, the hero of the Colosseum,

105
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,550
Mr. Diamante is...

106
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,520
...going to fight in the finals
in a last-minute substitution!

107
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,940
Diamante!

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,150
Diamante-sama!

109
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,410
--Take him to the medic room!
--Hurry up!

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,580
Hey somebody, bring some bandages!

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,390
Thank you, Agilia-san!

112
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,860
Because of you, I...

113
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh! Lucy!

114
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm moving on to...

115
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,810
Huh? Lucy?

116
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,650
No, he's not!

117
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,050
Hey, lady!

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,910
Don't talk to him like he's your friend!

119
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,490
You're Rebecca, aren't you?

120
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,530
I know your background.

121
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,640
My background?

122
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,070
It's gonna get a little messy, maybe,
but I won't do you wrong.

123
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,420
They're just putting up a good front.

124
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,030
This country is like...

125
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,340
...the country we grew up in, in some ways.

126
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,090
THE KING'S PLATEAU

127
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,830
It's great that you can help us
getting into the palace but...

128
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,310
We've just heard that we

129
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,280
THE LIFT TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE ROYAL PALACE

130
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,300
need a pass to enter the lift.

131
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,170
I have the pass.

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,030
--Oh! Then...
--But you shouldn't take the lift.

133
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,100
What? Why?

134
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,330
It does take you
to the entrance of the palace

135
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,540
but if they find out who you are,
it's all over.

136
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,040
Like I said,
let's kick the guards' asses and bust in!

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,150
That wouldn't do anything!
They'll stop us at some point!

138
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,130
Huh?! Yeah, you're right.

139
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,150
And more importantly...

140
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,330
Uh-huh. What is it?

141
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,520
You guys look too strange.

142
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,020
No, we don't!

143
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,260
Oh, now I remember!
You took our chef away earlier.

144
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,210
Sanji?!

145
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,570
Black Foot!

146
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,550
My sweet Violet-chan!

147
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,830
He took off to save your ship.

148
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,830
We know what happened.

149
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,520
You told him that the Sunny was in trouble?

150
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,300
You gave him the map to the Toy House
that he passed on to us?

151
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,010
Yes, I did.

152
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,930
Why did you have it?

153
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,700
I was Doflamingo's subordinate!

154
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,800
What?! You were?!

155
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,670
She was just pretending
that she was obeying him!

156
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,140
Wicka!

157
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,180
You remember me?!

158
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,630
Did you forget about my ability?

159
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,370
I've been watching what you all are doing.

160
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,010
Along with the one-legged soldier
who raised Rebecca after my sister died,

161
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,290
you people were preparing to fight!

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,920
Then, we'll destroy all the facilities there
and bring down the Doflamingo Family

163
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
and take Dressrosa back for King Riku!

164
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,990
I've been watching it all!

165
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,910
Thank you for believing in my father!

166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,850
Viola-sama!

167
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,750
THE TOY HOUSE

168
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,530
Strong Right!

169
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,540
Da-in!

170
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,140
Ton-Ton!

171
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,850
What the...

172
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,520
Now is our chance!
All of you, go get him!

173
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,160
How annoying!

174
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,530
Franky...

175
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,300
...Rocket!

176
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,060
Wait.

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,380
...Launcher!

178
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,580
--Run!
--That guy's dangerous!

179
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,850
Even though nothing comes out of
the pistol on his head!

180
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,080
Señor! Please run!

181
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Hide in the ground with your ability!

182
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,380
Don't brush your teeth
with a shoebrush now!

183
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,640
What?!

184
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,180
No way!

185
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,940
That's so hard-boiled!

186
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,850
Oh, Señor!
Stop brushing your molars!

187
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,780
It's not the time to clean your tongue!

188
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,190
Señor!

189
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,350
I can't believe it!

190
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,800
Señor Pink!

191
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,560
Señor!

192
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,860
Why didn't you use your ability
to get away?!

193
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,690
Hey, you're making a mistake, punks.

194
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,250
My Swim-Swim Fruit power which allows me to

195
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,780
swim through the walls or
the ground as I like, is...

196
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,420
...not meant for getting away
from enemies.

197
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,120
I swim...

198
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,460
...when I feel like swimming!

199
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,850
He's such a rebel!

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,370
Huh? B-Brandy?

201
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,480
--Oh, he's got blood all over his body!
--He must have some bones broken...

202
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,880
Is he cleansing himself with brandy?

203
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,780
--No!
--What?

204
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,750
Señor! You've just taken a hit to your face
at the risk of your life because...

205
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,020
...you knew...

206
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,360
...your helpless colleague was behind you!

207
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,900
Oh my stomach-in!

208
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,230
--Señor! Please!
--My heart's gonna explode!

209
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,160
That was a long time ago.
I don't dwell in the past.

210
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,190
Make love to me, Señor!

211
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,210
Hey Vise, are you alright?

212
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,290
I'm alright-in!

213
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,670
He's so hard-boiled!

214
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,320
Da-in!

215
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,090
Ton-Ton!

216
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh my stomach-in!

217
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,500
Huh?!

218
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,460
I've missed it again-in!

219
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:23,090
MACHVISE - AN EXECUTIVE
THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY (THE DIAMANTE ARMY)

220
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,110
You move like a rat!

221
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,360
Shut up!
Super who the hell are you?!

222
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,710
That's it!

223
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,050
Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hats!

224
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,120
The Navy is putting the Toy House
under complete siege!

225
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,890
Huh?! Why is the Navy doing that?!

226
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,930
What? Somebody, tell me what's going on-in!

227
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,930
Here comes more trouble.

228
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,570
Shoot-dara!

229
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,700
Yes, sir!

230
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,110
I guess their target is just me!

231
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,200
Screw it!
I'm gonna fight the Navy, too!

232
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,470
THE ROYAL PALACE

233
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,190
THE SUIT CHAMBER

234
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,370
The Navy is going at it.

235
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,280
I'm glad that you've made the
right decision, Fujitora.

236
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,190
It doesn't mean I'm taking your side.

237
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,210
Besides the Straw Hats, there are

238
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,600
other suspicious parties agitating in this country.

239
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,460
We have no choice!

240
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,790
The Navy must fight
to minimize civilian damage.

241
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:11,580
If the Straw Hat's goal is to kill you,
he'll cause mass destruction in doing it.

242
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,220
If so, my sense of justice tells me
I have to prevent it!

243
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,730
I will take care of you after that!

244
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,150
What do you say?

245
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,770
I'm just a newcomer
picked through the World Military Draft

246
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:49,250
but since being appointed as a Navy admiral,
there is something I want to do.

247
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,520
What is it?

248
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,510
It is nothing less than...

249
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,470
...the complete abolition of
the Seven Warlord system!

250
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,230
There was a pirate who attempted to
take over some kingdom in the past.

251
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,880
If he had succeeded, that kingdom would've

252
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,320
become a shady country such as this one.

253
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,960
The Navy.

254
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,390
The Seven Warlords.

255
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,470
The Four Emperors.

256
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,000
What do you think will happen to
the balance of power?

257
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,430
I don't know.

258
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,000
Who can tell before we upset it?
Let me tell you something.

259
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,810
What?

260
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,940
If you keep up your reign of terror...

261
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,400
...we'll raise the prize on you,
Heavenly Demon.

262
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,690
It sounded like you were suggesting
that I'd better kill you now.

263
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,840
Don't rush it.

264
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,530
Let's be nice to each
other for the time being.

265
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm just saying I'm going
to save your country.

266
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,180
No matter what kind of "fault" this country has
that'd be revealed,

267
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,360
I'm a blind man.

268
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,720
I won't see it so don't worry.

269
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,850
This year, we have the
World Conference - Reverie.

270
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,670
There will be some changes in the world
whether you like it or not.

271
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,210
What?!

272
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,890
You were a princess?!

273
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,420
--Ouch!
--You're too loud!

274
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,510
You mean you were
a princess of Dressrosa?

275
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,450
I used to be.

276
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,120
Rebecca is the king's granddaughter
so you're...

277
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,690
...her mother?!

278
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,240
Rebecca is my niece.

279
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,040
She's my sister Scarlet's daughter.

280
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,100
Oh! Don't tell me it's...

281
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,640
A hidden door?

282
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,190
I didn't know you were a ninja!

283
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,470
This way, you don't have to take the lift
to the entrance.

284
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,670
Follow me.

285
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,540
This is an emergency passage kept
secret by the King Riku Family.

286
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,740
Not even Doflamingo knows it's here.

287
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,280
What is this huge basket for?

288
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,390
It's a pulley system to
lift heavy loads. Look.

289
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,350
It's going all the way up there.

290
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,230
There is a staircase, too.

291
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,530
If you go up the stairs,

292
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,380
you'll reach the Rampart Tower
where the entrance to the palace is.

293
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,530
Luffy! Why don't you take this boulder
and go to the top?

294
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,110
Oh, that's a great idea.

295
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,270
If you can grab the chains and come down,

296
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,330
we can go up.

297
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,800
It's impossible!

298
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,230
--Alright!
--What?

299
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,500
Okay, see you guys!

300
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,440
--Hurry up, Luffy!
--Get in now, Ninja Woman!

301
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,610
Wh-What?!

302
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,050
The Corrida Colosseum Battle Tournament!

303
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,400
The final!

304
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,030
I've made it!

305
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,590
The whole nation is watching
as the special ring locks into place!

306
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,350
When "Fire Fist" Ace died,
it was reproduced!

307
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,670
It's a Logia, the most
powerful type of Devil Fruit!

308
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,040
The Flare-Flare Fruit!

309
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,160
Now, who's going to win it?!

310
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,710
The five contenders will enter
at any moment!

311
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,950
It's getting exciting.

312
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,010
Alright!
Let's go, Marine Colosseo!

313
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,260
My name is Bartolomeo!
What did you call me?

314
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,270
Alright!
The first contender to enter is...

315
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,840
It's him!

316
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,860
The man who has risen to
prominence in this competition!

317
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,900
Here comes our favorite - Lucy!

318
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,080
Watch over me, Ace!
