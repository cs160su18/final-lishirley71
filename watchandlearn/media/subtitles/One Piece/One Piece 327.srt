2
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,930
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,450
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,310
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,170
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,530
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,450
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,660
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,540
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,040
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,010
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,730
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,190
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,280
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,820
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,870
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,300
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,850
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,980
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,500
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,600
Find it!

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,250
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,060
As the Straw Hat Pirates
headed for the New World,

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,820
a suspicious ship appeared before them.

51
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,980
Luffy and his crew helped
those aboard the ship, but...

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,480
There is someone else I'd like you to see.

53
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,690
I-Is that the patient?

54
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,780
Click.

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,450
What is it?

56
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,320
I have managed to successfully
drive the prey into a tight corner.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,620
Oh?

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,400
My, my.

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,330
How appropriate for such a splendid day.

60
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,790
How could you call this a "mission"?!

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,880
Count us out!

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
We're going to steal this ship
and prepare to strike back.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,810
As things stand now, Vigaro-san
will never be able to rest in peace!

64
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,500
Hey, punks!

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,630
You're free toargue amongst yourselves...

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,550
...but I don't like the direction
this conversation's going.

67
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,620
"Sunny's in a Pinch!
Roar, Secret Super-Speed Mecha"

68
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,160
N-Now, now.

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,200
Don't get worked up, brothers!

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,540
Just for the record, we aren't
the least bit suspicious!

71
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,530
We're really just a group
of good-natured fishermen.

72
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,370
Right, men?

73
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,920
We'll only let your sketchy antics go so far.

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,070
Simple fishermen don't offer pirates
booze laced with some anesthetic.

75
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,430
Now then, it's time you came clean!

76
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,700
What the heck are you--

77
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,650
W-Wait a sec!

78
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,540
If we have a heart-to-heart, I think
we can and can't see eye-to-eye...

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,700
Which is it?!

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,510
Well, like I said...

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,500
H-Hey, guys!

82
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,290
W-Wait!

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,290
Don't mess with them, Guile!

84
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,710
There are only three of them!

85
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,340
Let's take this ship by force.

86
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,080
Yeah!

87
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,430
Then we can go back to...

88
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,060
I'm through with taking
orders from those freaks!

89
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,850
B-But they've been so good to us!

90
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,660
I can't...

91
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,740
It's just too heartless!

92
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,710
Shut it!

93
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,360
If you won't seize their ship, we will!

94
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,610
At the very least, don't hurt the lady!

95
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,430
Right!

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,850
You can't hurt her!

97
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,200
So that's your answer, huh?

98
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,720
It's nice and straightforward.

99
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,130
You bastards!

100
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,500
Don't mess with them!

101
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,920
What?!

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,220
Whoa, there.

103
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,840
Oh, sorry!

104
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,870
A-A few of mycrew mates have short fuses.

105
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,420
It's not like they meant you any harm.

106
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,870
Isn't that right?

107
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,510
Right?

108
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,960
Don't "eheh heh" me!

109
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,410
What are you trying to hide?

110
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,740
They clearly "meant us harm"!

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,540
Brrr!

112
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,540
It's freezing!

113
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,860
Jeez!

114
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,370
You still haven't dealt with them?

115
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,300
I thought they seemed fishy.

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,250
For fishermen, you didn't seem like
youwere all that great at fishing!

117
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,250
Come on!

118
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,880
We aren't naïve enough to fall for that one!

119
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,720
Minus a certain two, that is!

120
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,080
C-Commander Stansen...!

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,630
We're in trouble!

122
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,600
Now then, you'd better be ready to fight!

123
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,560
In that case, we'll just have to...

124
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,520
Retreat!

125
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,090
No way!

126
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,720
Wait, darn it!

127
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,320
Don't let them escape!

128
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,890
Damn it!

129
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,980
I'm gonna give your whole crew a watery grave!

130
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,640
It's okay.

131
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Leave them be.

132
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,870
Actually, have you seen Chopper?

133
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,910
I can't find him anywhere.

134
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,040
Chopper?

135
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,750
Oh, crud!

136
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,630
Are you gettinga bad feeling about this?

137
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,840
Those men must have kidnapped him.

138
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,550
That seems likely enough.

139
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,720
Tch, the punks!

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,650
At any rate, the quickest way to find
out is to board their ship and ask.

141
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,520
Let's hurry.

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,070
The wind is picking up.

143
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,400
This could turn into a storm!

144
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,220
With that having been said,what
should we do about these two?

145
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,650
I can't believe them!

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,140
Wake up!

147
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,580
Ow!

148
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,000
Hey!

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,690
It's super cold out here!

150
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,420
Eep!

151
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,860
Yeah!

152
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,630
And my head hurts.

153
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,220
It hurts bad!

154
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,880
Moron!

155
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,210
I told you not to underestimate them!

156
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,040
Darn it!

157
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,790
You've ruined the plan I devised!

158
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,770
Yeah, I'm terribly sorry...

159
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,330
N-Next time, we'll--

160
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,070
Oh, forget it!

161
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,220
You can pull back.

162
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,780
Sir?

163
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,860
Oh, jeez!

164
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,790
Didn't you hear me?

165
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:37,160
I said that I want you worthless
pieces of trash to keep out of my way.

166
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,580
Did I make myself clear?

167
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,040
Y-Yes...

168
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,880
You're absolutely right!

169
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,460
Right!

170
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,960
Right!

171
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,510
Roger!

172
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,070
Right!

173
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,290
Take care.

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,090
Click.

175
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,930
Men, we have a change of plans.

176
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,530
We're going with Trap: Sea Gull.

177
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,680
Yessir!

178
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,160
Damn those jerks!

179
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,340
How dare they trick us like that?!

180
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,530
Chopper...

181
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,780
Hey, you jerk!

182
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,920
Where are you hiding Chopper?

183
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,450
Captain Straw Hat, I hate to do this
after you took such good care of us,

184
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,830
but it's time we parted ways!

185
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,960
What?!

186
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,020
H-Hey!

187
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,390
Wait a sec, geezer!

188
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,380
What do you think you're doing?!

189
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,740
Crap!

190
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,090
He's going to cut the rope
that's connecting our ships.

191
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,400
What?!

192
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,950
Wait, damn it!

193
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,460
Gum-Gum...

194
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,720
Pistol!

195
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,230
The wind--!

196
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,520
Oops!

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,540
A power holder?

198
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,280
But your powers won't help you!

199
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,400
What?!

200
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,210
Robin!

201
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,950
Way to go!

202
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,330
She's another Devil Fruit power holder?

203
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,290
Salchow-sama, Trap: Sea Gull is set!

204
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,710
Great!

205
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,920
Then let's get it under way!

206
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,880
It's show time!

207
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,690
What's that music?

208
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,480
Hey?

209
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,950
Do you hear that?

210
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,390
It's coming from over there!

211
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,600
What's with the music?

212
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,440
Something is coming!

213
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,030
What is that?

214
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,200
No way...!

215
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,240
I-It's the Marines!

216
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
What?!

217
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,970
Tch!

218
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,170
They've already sniffed us out.

219
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,460
Why'd they have to show up now?

220
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,420
This is bad!

221
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,910
Get us out of here, Nami!

222
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,510
I'm on it!

223
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,300
This is really bad!

224
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,680
The Straw Hats' ship is on the move.

225
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,970
Why don't we give them a bit of a scare?

226
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,050
Do it!

227
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,180
Yessir!

228
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

229
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,920
They're firing at us!

230
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,280
Hurry it up, Nami!

231
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,400
They're gonna blow us sky-high!

232
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,670
I know, I know!

233
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,510
Sanji-kun!

234
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,540
Aye aye!

235
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,830
I'm not done yet!

236
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,870
Light up!

237
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,830
Light up, pronto!

238
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,170
Hey!

239
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,420
They're in front of us, too!

240
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,050
Nami, what now?

241
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,530
Hard left rudder!

242
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,760
Aye aye, sir!

243
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,750
Dance, dance!

244
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,560
Light up Numbers Six, Seven, and Eight!

245
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,630
No!

246
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,670
They're over here, too?

247
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,550
No way!

248
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,480
What's going on?

249
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,650
Hey, now...

250
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,320
This can't be real!

251
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,650
What's going on?

252
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,080
W-We're surrounded!

253
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,180
Nice!

254
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,540
Really nice!

255
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,050
What will you do next?

256
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,860
What should we do, Nami?!

257
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,580
Please figure somethin' out, Nami!

258
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,760
Jeez, you're annoying!

259
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,820
I'm trying to think!

260
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,900
Nami-san, there is a hole
right through there!

261
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,930
What?

262
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:27,930
No way!

263
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,310
For real?!

264
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,310
Don't leave me!

265
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,810
Don't leave me!

266
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,440
Where?! Where?! Where?!

267
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,350
Wow!

268
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,620
There really is one!

269
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,850
Think we can make it?

270
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,650
Let's go!

271
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,110
You got it!

272
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,410
What's going on?!

273
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,500
It won't work!

274
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,630
The wind changed directions.

275
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,830
We can't get on course!

276
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,040
Whoa!

277
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,750
I can't take any more of this!

278
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,780
D-Damn it!

279
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,860
The rudder won't budge!

280
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,460
Move it!

281
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,240
Jerk!

282
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,270
What was that for?!

283
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,770
Have you forgotten?

284
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,550
We've got a Soldier Dock
System for times like this!

285
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,180
Channel 0...

286
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,640
Activate!

287
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,310
With its cola-run engine,
it's the Paddle Ship Sunny!

288
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,590
Go!

289
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,370
Wh-What's going on?

290
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,290
Jiro, lend me a hand!

291
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,540
This rocking is going to
split his wounds back open!

292
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,210
Okay!

293
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,980
Yahoo! We got through!

294
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,300
Awesome!

295
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,420
It looks like the Marines can't
do a thing to stop us!

296
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,190
Of course not!

297
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,350
No one can keep up with us!

298
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,370
Super!

299
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,710
The operation is complete.

300
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,030
We successfully got the Straw
Hatsto head for the Arctic Path.

301
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,100
They fell for it hook, line, and sinker.

302
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,410
What a great success!

303
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,540
They have no hope to escape now, none at all.

304
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,000
Now let's report to Campaccino-sama!

305
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,460
Chopper, where are you?!

306
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,530
Hey, Chopper!

307
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,510
We came to get you!

308
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,650
That voice...

309
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,210
Let me know if you're here!

310
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,890
It's Luffy.

311
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,810
I'll be right back.

312
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,990
D-Dr. Chopper?!

313
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,080
Hey, where are you?!

314
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,280
Chopper!

315
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,280
Wait!

316
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,700
Don't move!

317
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,660
Don't take another--

318
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,510
That's enough!

319
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,700
Straw Hat...

320
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm sorry!

321
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,270
I'm terribly sorry!

322
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,660
Hey, knock that off...

323
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,890
Why are you kowtowing to him?!

324
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,700
Shut up!

325
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,230
I am terribly sorry about
how rude we've been!

326
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,260
I feel bad about tricking you.

327
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,650
I'm begging you!

328
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,720
Please forgive us!

329
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,230
None of that matters.

330
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,090
We just cameto get Chopper back.

331
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,340
Right?

332
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,680
Uh-huh!

333
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,640
This guy keeps throwing me off.

334
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,170
U-Understood!

335
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,530
We'll go searchfor your
ship's doctor right now!

336
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,240
Luffy!

337
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,450
Chopper!

338
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,570
Jeez!

339
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,900
So you were here after all.

340
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,380
C'mon.

341
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,330
Let's hurry on back.

342
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,780
Actually...

343
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,590
Wait!

344
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,710
Don't take off with him!

345
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,020
I still need the doctor to stay here!

346
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,140
Who're you?

347
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,670
If you're dead set on
taking him now, I'll...!

348
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,750
You'll what?

349
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,690
Jiro!

350
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,510
Don't do it, Jiro!

351
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,620
Put me down!

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,090
Don't be crazy!

353
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,160
He'll kill you!

354
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,630
So what if he does?!

355
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,780
I'm not afraid to die!

356
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,060
I'm not like you cowards!

357
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm not gonna lose!

358
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,020
I don't care how strong he is,
I'm never gonna lose ever again!

359
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,980
Let go of me!

360
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,160
Chopper, what the heck is going on here?

361
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,440
Luffy,

362
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,110
honestly, I want to stay
here for a while longer.

363
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,570
I have a patient who is badly hurt.

364
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,790
I've already finished the operation,
but he's still in critical condition.

365
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,880
Please!

366
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,660
I want to look after him until
he regains consciousness.

367
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,090
That right?

368
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,040
Okay.

369
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,460
In that case, we can wait.

370
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,390
Doctor, thank you for
what you said back there.

371
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,390
Jiro, I don't know much about you guys.

372
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,210
And it looks like you can't
disclose what's going on.

373
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,250
But don't you worry.

374
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,270
I may be a pirate, but I'm also a doctor.

375
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,170
If I see someone in pain,

376
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,180
it doesn't matter who he is,

377
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,730
I'd give my life to treat him!

378
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,700
We're also a band of pirates.

379
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,010
You guys are pirates?

380
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,590
Yeah...

381
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:09,070
And this man is the captain of
our pirate band, the Phoenix Pirates.

382
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,090
He's Puzzle-san the Phoenix.

383
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,380
Phoenix...?

384
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,420
Yeah.

385
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,040
No matter how dangerous the situation got,

386
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,380
no matter how severely he got injured,

387
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,920
he always stood back up!

388
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,890
He was just like a phoenix...

389
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,720
Captain!

390
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,480
I burnt him to a crisp!

391
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,720
Wh-What?!

392
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
I didn't feel a thing!

393
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,020
You can't kill me with that toy.

394
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,940
Are you a monster?!

395
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,850
I'm a phoenix!

396
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,620
Me and the guys...

397
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,250
We all felt that he was going
to become the King of the Pirates.

398
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,340
But things were different over there!

399
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,130
The New World was on
a completely different level.

400
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,800
You went to the New World?

401
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,750
Yeah,

402
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,010
but we didn't stand a chance.

403
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,720
They didn't even take Puzzle-san seriously.

404
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,240
We managed to escape somehow.

405
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,110
They truly were on a completely
different level...

406
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,910
But...

407
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:19,740
But I still believe that Puzzle-san will
rise back up, just like a phoenix!

408
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,200
Damn it!

409
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,620
I can't take it anymore!

410
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,540
Curse that jerk Stansen!

411
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
Shhh!

412
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,000
Quit leaving "Commander" out
when you say his name!

413
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,550
He'll whack us again if he hears you.

414
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,250
Hmph!

415
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,070
Like I care!

416
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,720
I've just abouthad it with
that freaking coward.

417
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,260
Don't you feel the same way?

418
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,280
Guile's right!

419
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,390
How can you stand things the way they are?

420
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,430
Seriously!

421
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,230
How long must we endure this humiliation?

422
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,310
First they stole our Jolly Roger,

423
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,940
and then they made us their lackeys!

424
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,530
What were you thinking?!

425
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,670
I'd rather die than join the likes of them!

426
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,540
Moron!

427
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,220
Why do you think Vigaro was willing to
sacrifice his life to protect yours?

428
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,130
Don't you dare throw your life away!

429
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,280
We believe that once the
captain has recovered,

430
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,600
we'll steal our Jolly Roger back and
return to our pirate ways.

431
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,040
But I bet Stansen's plans are different.

432
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,400
How are they different?

433
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,060
When you get down to it, he's just
a coward who's afraid to die.

434
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,610
It's obvious by the way
he treats those hunters!

435
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,050
Our defeat in the New World must
have shaken him to the core.

436
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,020
For now, all we can do is pray
for the captain's recovery and wait.

437
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,710
But if anything should
happen to the captain...

438
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,010
...he's obviously going to
continue working as a hunter

439
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,840
to prolong his own sorry life!

440
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,970
But not me!

441
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,720
If it means giving up being a pirate,

442
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,600
I'd rather defy him and
challenge the hunters to a fight

443
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,310
as a member of the Phoenix Pirates!

444
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,460
If the time comes, I'll join you!

445
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,560
Naturally!

446
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,320
How about you?

447
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,180
I joined this band out
of respect for Captain Puzzle.

448
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,320
Yeah!

449
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,750
No matter what happens to the captain,

450
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,960
we can't do anything that
would hurt his name!

451
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,380
That's true...

452
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,330
I'm sure Vigaro-san wouldn't want to
see us like this from the other side!

453
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,300
All right!

454
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,370
It sounds like everyone is
prepared for the worst.

455
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,290
Tonight will be a critical
turning point for all of us...

456
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,680
If anything happens to the
captain, you know what to do.

457
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,280
Wow!

458
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,720
Everywhere you look, there are icebergs.

459
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,080
What is it?

460
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,700
Something feels off...

461
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,170
Because of these icebergs,

462
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,690
it almost feels like the ship
is following a path of its own...

463
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,680
What was that?!

464
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,670
Dang, talk about dangerous!

465
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,840
Sanji-kun, look ahead!

466
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,830
What--?

467
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,830
Crap!

468
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,280
Hard aport!

469
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,450
Damn it!

470
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,200
Phew, that was close!

471
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,930
What was with that iceberg?

472
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,790
It came out of nowhere!

473
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,100
What's going on?

474
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,020
There is something weird about these icebergs!

475
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,020
It looks like they're moving on their own.

476
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,030
What?

477
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,400
You see, those new recruits screwed up!

478
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,490
Oh, but I was sure to chase our
prey into the usual area, Brother!

479
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,130
It isn't your place to call me that.

480
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,320
Well, we may only be
brothers-in-law, but we are still--

481
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,320
Really, Campaccino!

482
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,000
I can't believe you're teasing my honey again!

483
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,880
Salchow, you didn't fail to finish
off that big fish, did you?

484
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,450
But, but, I didn't let them get away!

485
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,700
I did everything I could!

486
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,930
Okay, Honey?

487
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,500
Really!

488
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,510
Don't expect me to pamper you!

489
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,220
But I'm so cold without you that
I'm afraid I'll freeze, Arbell!

490
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,930
Oh, you're so silly!

491
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,360
The party is on hold.

492
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,440
We're going to have to personally
hunt down that prey.

493
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,780
The timing couldn't be better!

494
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,240
We can work together as siblings to
catchthem as our birthday present for Papa!

495
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,910
Just wait until you see
what we bring in, Papa!

496
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,410
Hey, Arbell!

497
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,890
Let's go together.

498
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,090
I can't, Lil!

499
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,360
You know that.

500
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
I'm paired with my darling!

501
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,590
I hate that man.

502
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,050
A total bounty of 600 million Berries, eh?

503
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,590
I can't wait to see their Jolly Roger!

504
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,100
Why don't we celebrate early?

505
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,720
May our beloved Papa, Don Accino,

506
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,560
and the Accino Family's knitblood
relations be blessed!

507
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,310
And here's to our present for Papa--

508
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,280
the heads of the Straw Hat Pirates.

509
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,990
Cheers!

510
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,510
Now head on out, my
beloved sons and daughters!

511
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,380
It's time for the hunt to begin.

512
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,460
Look out!

513
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,130
Sanji-kun, hard aport!

514
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,670
You've got it, Nami-san!

515
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,650
What is with these waters?

516
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,970
It goes from one thing to the next!

517
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,840
It feels like they're luring us somewhere...

518
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,470
Look out!

519
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:35,470
Hard a-starboard!

520
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,670
The rudder's frozen!

521
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,180
Are Luffy and Chopper ready yet?

522
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

523
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,480
"The Dream Sinking in the New World!
The Disillusioned Pirate, Puzzle"

524
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,970
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
