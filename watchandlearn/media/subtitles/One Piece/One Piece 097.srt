00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,390
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,880
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,590
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,740
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,660
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,580
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,280
The once-green city of
Erumalu now lies in ruins.

28
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,880
To stop the rebel army, Luffy and
company now head into the desert

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,160
for Yuba, the oasis town.

30
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,100
"Adventure in the Country of Sand! The
Monsters that Live in the Scorching Land"

31
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,990
Burning up...
Sweat won't even come out...

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,550
Quit moaning so much, Luffy.
You'll only tire yourself out.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,200
Guess he's not listening.

34
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,960
I can't go on...
I can't take hot weather...

35
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,380
I'm fine in cold weather, though...

36
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,080
It's 'cause of all that fur...
You should take off that animal suit...

37
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,430
What was that, you jerk?!

38
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,980
Don't make fun of reindeer!

39
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,020
Monster!

40
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,650
Chopper! Don't turn big!
Or else I won't pull ya!

41
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,390
Who're you calling a monster,
Humongo-Nose?!

42
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,200
D-Don't be stupid!
I-I'll have you know this nose--

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,860
Just turn back already!

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,040
You don't seem to be having
a hard time, Vivi-chan.

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,750
I was born and raised here,
so it doesn't bother me much.

46
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,070
But what's with all these hills?

47
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,660
I figured a desert would be more flat.

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,720
This is a very old desert,

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,030
so some sand dunes here
are over 300 meters high.

50
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,950
Th-Three hundred meters?

51
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,440
No wonder this is like
climbing mountains...

52
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,440
It's too much... It's so hot...

53
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,150
Just one drink, Luffy.
Just one mouthful.

54
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,420
Don't drink so much!

55
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,170
Let me have some, too!
That was 13 mouthfuls just now!

56
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,620
Hold on! You just had some! I'm next!

57
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,710
Stop fighting!
You'll only waste strength!

58
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,040
--But she started it!
--It's your fault!

59
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,570
Yeah! This is because of you!

60
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,650
So hungry...

61
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,920
Don't be so greedy!
It's still raw! Don't eat that!

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,680
Nami-san! Just a minute,
it'll be ready soon!

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,350
--Oh, looks pretty good!
--Get away, you!

64
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,990
Oh, come on!
Cheapskate! Let us eat!

65
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,640
Get away!

66
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,660
It was so hot during the day!
What's going on?!

67
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,090
With nothing to block
out the temperature,

68
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,750
the desert scorches during the day
but falls below freezing at night.

69
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,080
The desert is fraught
with unpredictable dangers.

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,730
Oh! Look at all those stars!

71
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,200
Didn't you see stars
on your winter island?

72
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,040
Winter island skies are always
covered with thick snow clouds,

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,220
so I've never seen
so many stars before!

74
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,510
I don't have the luxury of
looking at stars right now...

75
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,410
Cold weather doesn't bother me!

76
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,380
That's because you wear
such a warm suit!

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,600
Hey, you! Get away!

78
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,020
I can't help that you're so fluffy...

79
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,500
Quit making fun of reindeer!

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,990
Monster!

81
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,120
Chopper. Don't turn big.
We need your warmth.

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
Yahoo!

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
So warm!

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
Come closer!

85
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,330
See? Warm, isn't it?

86
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,330
Yeah!

87
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,600
It must be a real surprise for you.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,850
I mean Luffy-san.
I was surprised too, at first.

89
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,960
Maybe it's that he isn't captain-like,

90
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,930
or that normal pirate captains are
respected by their crewmates...

91
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,390
But just this afternoon, a simple
drink of water caused that big fight.

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,470
But...

93
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,270
But, you know...

94
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,730
The longer I've been with them,
the more I've come to understand.

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,690
That's how Luffy does things.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,480
Eh?

97
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,690
He hasn't changed a bit
since he was a kid.

98
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,640
Despite how he seems,
people always gather around him.

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,740
Even though he's my little brother,
he has a mysterious charm to him.

100
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,160
Oh. You already knew.

101
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,540
He and I do go way back.

102
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,130
But thanks.

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,070
Eh?

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,780
You were worried that
I was concerned, right?

105
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,500
Yes. But it looks like I didn't
need to worry after all.

106
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,820
Whoa! I found a shrimp!

107
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,680
So this is a shrimp?! Wow!

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,910
--Shrimp don't live in the desert!
--See?!

109
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,020
Oh, you're right!
Is it a "desert shrimp"?

110
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,680
--It looks yummy!
--Hey, now! Are they edible?!

111
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,290
Probably! Crawfish are edible, after all!

112
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,750
I've never seen a real shrimp before!

113
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,090
Stop, Luffy-san! Throw that away!

114
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,050
No! That'd be a waste!

115
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,640
That's a scorpion! It's small
but it's very poisonous!

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,180
You'll die if it stings you!

117
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,820
Oh. It's not edible? How boring.

118
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,410
--You can have it.
--Don't give it to me!

119
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,390
Then I'll throw it away.

120
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,060
I'm sorry.
I should've mentioned it earlier.

121
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,260
That's for sure!

122
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,760
What is it, Chopper?

123
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,990
Something's... coming.

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,580
Something? What?

125
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,850
Oh? Is the wind picking up?

126
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,230
Everyone!

127
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,120
Hide behind the rocks!

128
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,230
What?

129
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,190
A storm! A sandstorm is coming!

130
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,820
Oh?

131
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,280
Whoa! Cool!

132
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,500
Again?! Deserts are nothing but storms!

133
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,080
I forgot to mention it, but sandstorms
are one of the desert's dangers!

134
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,960
Mention these things sooner!

135
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,060
What the hell was that?!

136
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,710
Can't people get some rest?!

137
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,190
Hey! Sanji! Let's have a lunch!
A Pirate Boxed Lunch!

138
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,500
Not yet. Not until Vivi-chan says so.

139
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,360
Come on, Vivi! Let's eat!
I'm out of strength!

140
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,590
But we're only one-tenth of
the way to Yuba, Luffy-san.

141
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,470
You're so dumb! Haven't
you heard of this proverb?

142
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,560
"If you're hungry, eat!"

143
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,020
You liar! Quit making stuff up!

144
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,580
All right.

145
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,020
Then what do you say we take a
break at the next rocks we find?

146
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,360
Alright! Rocks!

147
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,170
Guys! Let's hurry to the next rocks!

148
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,520
Whoever wins rock-paper-scissors
has to carry everyone's stuff!

149
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,700
Quit deciding things!

150
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,160
Shouldn't the loser carry the stuff?

151
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,950
Alright, here goes!

152
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,700
Rock, paper, scissors!

153
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,660
Hold on, now!

154
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,920
--Hey! You went after!
--Woohoo! I win!

155
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,670
Idiot.

156
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,920
H-Heavy... So heavy... And hot...

157
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,180
I won rock-paper-scissors,
so why me?

158
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,960
It's because you won.
Now shut up and haul.

159
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,520
Don't drop it, now!

160
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,200
Rocks spotted a small ways ahead!

161
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,570
For reals?!

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,030
Break time! Food!

163
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,990
Whoa! He's fast!

164
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Shade! Feels so good!

165
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,650
Hey! Say something!

166
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,810
I'll go get you a doctor!

167
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,860
Bad news!

168
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,040
Huh? He's coming back!

169
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,910
There's lots of hurt birds
that can't move! Chopper!

170
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,650
Right!

171
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,800
--Alright! Let's go, Chopper!
--Yeah!

172
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,170
We gotta help the birds!

173
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,150
Birds?!

174
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,760
Wait, Luffy-san! Don't tell
me these birds are--!

175
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,010
Eh?

176
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,640
All our stuff is gone!

177
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,280
We've been had...

178
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,580
It's the truth! There really
were dying birds here!

179
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,130
I'm sorry. I should've
mentioned it earlier.

180
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,450
Warusagi birds are
"desert bandits" that trick travelers

181
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,920
and steal their belongings.

182
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,390
What?!

183
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,180
Birds playing dead?!
That's dishonest!

184
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,200
Yes, that's how they are.

185
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,840
They tricked me?!

186
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,650
Luffy! Is that all you can
say for yourself?!

187
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,260
There were three days
of provisions in there!

188
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,040
And you just had to let some
damn birds steal everyone's stuff

189
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,330
smack in the middle of this desert?!

190
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,580
How're we supposed to cross the
desert without food or water now?!

191
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,950
It's not my fault. They tricked me.

192
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,390
Is your brain less than a bird's?!

193
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,170
Say what?!

194
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,360
Stop it, you two!

195
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,170
There's no use.

196
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,690
At times like this,
it's best to let them have it out.

197
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,840
Yeah, huh?

198
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,520
Let's take a short break.
This heat is what has them fuming.

199
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,690
I'm sure we'll manage food-wise.

200
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,900
It's nothing that'll kill us.
Let's just put it out of our minds.

201
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,320
Yeah. Just thinking makes me thirstier.

202
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,340
Give us our stuff back!

203
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,710
Luffy-san! Don't chase them!

204
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,050
That idiot.

205
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,930
Hey, you! Will you be
able to come back?!

206
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,640
Come back, Luffy!

207
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,600
Stop! You can't get away from me!

208
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,900
Get back here!

209
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,830
Get back here!

210
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,120
What are these?!

211
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,030
What is this thing?

212
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,110
A mystery desert plant?

213
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,740
Neat!

214
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,340
What are you doing?

215
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,720
That's funny!

216
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,790
Huh? You want me to help you?

217
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,510
Gum-Gum...

218
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,100
...Pistol!

219
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,140
Good thing you didn't get eaten!

220
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,940
The birds got away while
I was beating these guys up!

221
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,640
The desert sure is full
of strange creatures!

222
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,460
Hey, camel. What're you doing
out here all by yourself?

223
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,080
What is it?

224
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,800
Did you find something?

225
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,990
What the--?!

226
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,700
What's taking Luffy so long?!

227
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,410
Yeah. Do you think he got lost?

228
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,190
He has a horrible sense of
direction but always has to run off!

229
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,880
And there are so many desert
dangers he doesn't know about...

230
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,890
Y'know, isn't he hungry
from not eating anything?

231
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,420
He's such a lost cause.

232
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,350
You can say that again.

233
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,330
Sorry.

234
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,570
For my little brother's ineptness.
I apologize for the trouble.

235
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,070
Good luck finding him!

236
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,910
Yeah.

237
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,160
What's that?!

238
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,500
What's this rumbling?!

239
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,130
Another sandstorm?!

240
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
No, wait! That's--!

241
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,100
Luffy?!

242
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,560
No... it couldn't be!

243
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,880
Why is he on a camel?!

244
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,110
So?! What's that chasing him?!

245
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,410
I can't really see!

246
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,520
But it seems more like
something's in the sand!

247
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,980
It's huge!

248
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,180
What is that?!

249
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,890
A Sandora Dragon!

250
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,430
A what now?!

251
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,670
They're the largest of the
reptiles living in the desert

252
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,890
and they wait under the
sand for their prey!

253
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,400
They have sharp claws and fangs,
but they hardly ever use them!

254
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
The reason being that they tend
to swallow their prey whole

255
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
because they're so large!

256
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,240
He really does have a gift
for attracting trouble.

257
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,920
Setting aside the camel for the moment...

258
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,790
...what star was he born under to be
able to attract trouble like this?!

259
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,080
Hey! Camel! Stop!

260
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,920
--Luffy! Is it too much for you?!
--We'll lend a hand!

261
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,660
Yeah! I brought some meat!

262
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,090
Here goes, lizard!

263
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,970
Gum-Gum...

264
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,510
--Tatsu...
--êpaule...

265
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,050
...Whip!

266
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,180
--...Maki!
--...Shoot!

267
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,990
Y-You didn't have to go that far...

268
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,110
When they're fighting,
you almost pity the monsters...

269
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,880
There's more?!

270
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,460
I forgot to mention it,
but Sandora Dragons hunt in pairs!

271
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,700
Mention these things!

272
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,970
--Ace!
--Look out!

273
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,010
What a nuisance.

274
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,050
You wanna play?

275
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,650
Oh, okay. If that's what you want.

276
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,040
Check it out! These rocks
are natural frying pans!

277
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,360
So, what's with the camel?

278
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,760
I dunno.

279
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,380
It was getting eaten by a mystery
plant when I was chasing the birds.

280
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,590
It doesn't seem to be a wild camel.

281
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,450
No. It even has a saddle...

282
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,690
I knew it!

283
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,400
Oh! Good for you!

284
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,130
Huh? You know each other?

285
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,030
Yeah! He gave me a ride
when I escaped from Katorea!

286
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,000
That's great! We can ride it?!
That'll make things easier!

287
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,460
Yeah, that'll be a real help!
Looks like it could carry two people!

288
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,340
Camels do go hand-in-hand with deserts!

289
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,410
Then I'll be the first one!

290
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,840
What was that for?!

291
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,150
"I am a freedom-loving,
hard-boiled, compassionate camel!

292
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,250
Thanks for helping me out of that pinch.

293
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,640
I can give you a lift,
but no men allowed!"

294
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,080
This guy's a punk!

295
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,230
Yeah! You let Chopper ride you!

296
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,710
"I'm manly!"

297
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,150
--Quit being stupid!
--Why, you--!

298
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm so sorry!
My crewmates are so ill-bred!

299
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,120
You're a good boy!
What should we call you?

300
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,660
--Idiot!
--Moron!

301
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,520
Doofus!

302
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,200
"Lashes" it is, then!

303
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,580
Uhh, that's the weirdest one of all.

304
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay! Get on, Vivi!

305
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,930
No, I can still walk!

306
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,880
Just get on.

307
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,600
Pervy camel! Pervy camel!

308
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,340
Pervy camel! Pervy camel!

309
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,510
Now we should make a little better time!

310
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,210
We need to get to Yuba as fast as
we can to talk to the rebel army!

311
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,350
Giddyup, Lashes!

312
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,060
Hold on!

313
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,800
Hurry, guys! If you get separated,
you'll never leave the desert alive!

314
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
Quit being stupid!

315
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,710
I like this side of Nami-san, too!

316
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,940
After them! Hurry!

317
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,620
--Get on, Chopper!
--Yeah!

318
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,830
Wait for us!

319
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,020
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

320
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,070
I continue on to the ends of emotion

321
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,200
I scoop up my hands,

322
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,710
and the sand and time
that spills from them

323
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,670
show me that this is
what I was born to do

324
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:56,670
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

325
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:08,570
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

326
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,240
no one knows about

327
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,500
--So hot...
--Nami-san! How far did you go?!

328
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
We're completely separated now!

329
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,390
Come to think of it,
I don't see Ace, either.

330
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,430
--Do you think he got separated?
--What a troublesome big brother!

331
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,510
--Huh?! What's that?!
--Do you see Nami's group?!

332
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,770
A ship! A pirate ship in the sand!

333
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,770
"Enter the Desert Pirates!
The Men Who Live Freely"

335
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,410
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
