2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,290
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,300
Luffy was ejected from
the Sabaody Archipelago

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,150
by Bartholomew Kuma, a Warlord of the Sea.

52
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,380
He landed in the female-only
empire of Amazon Lily!

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,310
"Everyone Falls in Love!
Pirate Empress Hancock"

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,400
Sorry I can't pay you back for
everything you've done for me.

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,830
Well, I should be going now!

56
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,370
Men are so mysterious.

57
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,040
Their arms stretch, they suddenly grow fat,

58
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,840
their chests are flat,

59
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,480
and between their legs they have...

60
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,520
Hate to ask for help again,
but could you take these off?

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,650
Your family jewels?!

62
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,330
No! I mean these!

63
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm going to look for my friends now!

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,290
But they'll laugh if they
see me dressed like this!

65
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,290
I think it looks very nice on you...

66
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,560
There.

67
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,720
Thanks!

68
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,930
Hating frills...

69
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,420
Men really are strange creatures.

70
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,090
Well, yeah, I guess so.

71
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,770
Thanks for taking it off!

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,210
Well, bye!

73
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,820
I'll never feel relaxed
until I find my friends!

74
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,610
You certainly are hasty...

75
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,490
As long as the others are still alive
like I am, that's all that matters.

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,970
As long as they're alive,

77
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,080
I can keep fighting again and again!

78
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm gonna surpass all of those guys!

79
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,720
Alright! I'm gonna walk on my hands
all the way to Sabaody Archipelago!

80
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,740
That'll make me stronger!

81
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,460
Could you give me a ship?

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,690
You really are hasty...

83
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
You don't have any ships?!

84
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,620
This is a Calm Belt?!

85
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,500
Yes. This maiden island is surrounded

86
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,700
by a giant Sea King den known as a Calm Belt.

87
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,650
Which is why sailors never dare come near.

88
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,030
Castaways will sometimes
miraculously drift here,

89
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,310
but most of the time only as corpses.

90
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,170
But you said there's a pirate group here!

91
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,080
The Snake Princess's pirate ship, the Yuda,

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,630
is pulled by vicious, poisonous sea snakes,

93
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,150
so Sea Kings can't attack it.

94
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,460
It's the only ship on Amazon Lily!

95
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,190
Now what do I do?

96
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,440
There's no wind...

97
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,740
Should I build a raft and
paddle all the way there?

98
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,190
That's ridiculous!

99
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,230
Okay! I'm gonna build a raft
and paddle all the way there!

100
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,530
That's what you just thought up!

101
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,360
It's done!

102
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,380
That's terrible! It's already about to break!

103
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,480
No way! I thought he was a pirate!

104
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,030
I had no obligation to save you!

105
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,550
Are all men unable to swim,
even if they're pirates?

106
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,700
That was close!

107
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,480
Darn it!

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,850
If only Franky were here!

109
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,450
I dunno what to do!

110
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,380
I'm the one who doesn't know what to do!

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,260
You could've at least escaped
to somewhere far away...

112
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,630
If we keep this up,
I'll only grow attached to you!

113
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,420
Whoa, now! Stop!

114
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,030
What're you doing?!

115
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,640
Oh, yeah! These arrows!

116
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,310
They were strong enough
to destroy stone walls

117
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,940
when I was being chased earlier!

118
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,750
They don't seem like
special arrows, though...

119
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,580
What are you talking about?

120
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,790
The arrows possess "Haki"!
Their strength is only natural!

121
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,780
Haki? What's that?!

122
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,780
There she is!

123
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,660
Margaret is all right!

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,620
Everyone!

125
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,720
The man is with her! Kill him!

126
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,290
Uh oh!

127
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,390
Halt!

128
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,510
Stop!

129
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,340
Margaret! Are you alright?!

130
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,230
We need to hurry and finish the man off!

131
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,230
The Snake Princess has returned!

132
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,830
You have real guts to lay anchor in
the middle of monster-infested waters.

133
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,290
Yes. We were attacked
only moments ago, in fact!

134
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,830
The Sea Prism Stone in this warship
may conceal our presence,

135
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,060
but staying anchored here for so long

136
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,490
is bound to attract attention visually.

137
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,810
It's not easy,

138
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,860
but the agreement between
the Kuja and the government

139
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,100
forbids us from getting any closer

140
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,440
than three kilometers from your island.

141
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,390
Consequently, we're forced to wait
in the middle of the monsters' den.

142
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,260
Have you heard?

143
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,710
They say the Kuja are specters
that turn people to stone!

144
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,960
Get real!

145
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,260
Did you kill that Sea King?

146
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,880
Sea Kings are hardly rare in the Grand Line,

147
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,200
but in the Calm Belts,
they're certainly larger...

148
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,210
no, monstrous.

149
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,150
Any sign of the Kuja ship?!

150
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,420
Not yet, Vice-Admiral!

151
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,900
There are no approaching ships at all!

152
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,690
How long is she going to keep us waiting?!

153
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,020
Or has the Kuja empress decided to...?!

154
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,730
S-Sea King!

155
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,470
Fire! Fire!

156
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,090
Impossible! Not even cannons have an effect?!

157
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,510
The ship'll be smashed to pieces
if we don't do something!

158
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,200
What do we do?!

159
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,580
There's no way to defend against it!

160
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,460
Is it planning to eat the entire ship?!

161
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:37,010
To think the very first to greet us
is this beast and not the Kuja...!

162
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,130
That's...

163
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,490
...the vice-admiral!

164
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,090
Allowing an entire warship
to be food for a Sea King

165
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,390
would belittle the name of justice!

166
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,770
Those cuts...

167
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,340
Did you slice it from inside its stomach?

168
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,690
I have not come to hunt Sea Kings.

169
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,180
I would like to finish my business here
and leave these waters quickly.

170
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,370
It looks like you have some skill.

171
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,910
I was growing tired of waiting!

172
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,670
At last you've returned, Kuja Pirates!

173
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,040
I am Vice-Admiral Momonga
of Navy Headquarters!

174
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,580
Warlord of the Sea and
Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!

175
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,750
Show yourself! I've come for you!

176
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,120
So sorry, but the
Snake Princess isn't coming out.

177
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,580
She's sent many replies now!

178
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,730
That's men for you!
Such unsophisticated creatures!

179
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,270
I haven't seen a live man in a long time!

180
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,080
Pirates and merchants always escape
by boat when they see the Kuja flag!

181
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,720
Stop. That's a crude laugh.

182
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,940
We have received her replies of,

183
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,210
"I will follow your orders
to convene at once."

184
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,570
But she shows no indication
of coming whatsoever!

185
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,750
This morning's newspaper.

186
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,440
A place and date has been decided
for the public execution

187
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,030
of Portgas D. Ace, 2nd Division
Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates!

188
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,580
There is no turning back now!

189
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,840
The World Government has issued strict orders

190
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,030
forcing the Seven Warlords
of the Sea to assemble!

191
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,690
Refuse and the agreement is off!

192
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,340
Your title of Warlord of
the Sea will be revoked!

193
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,230
Think about what that would mean!

194
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,850
Until now, the World Government
has allowed you to do as you wish,

195
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,800
but without the title, you would be
nothing more than ordinary pirates,

196
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,200
and therefore adversaries of the
World Government and the navy!

197
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,560
Do you hear that, Boa Hancock?!

198
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,340
Who placed a kitten...

199
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,930
...in my path?!

200
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,960
M-My deepest apologies!

201
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,740
I'm the one responsible!

202
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,760
Be more careful.

203
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Y-Yes!

204
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
S-Stop that!

205
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,350
So you've come out, Boa Hancock!

206
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,030
Don't let your guard down, men!

207
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,460
He's right!

208
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,290
We're dealing with the boss
of a bunch of specters!

209
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,220
There's no telling how terrifying she is!

210
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,760
Don't let your guard--!

211
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,340
Th-That's the Pirate Empress?!

212
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,070
She's the definition of the most
beautiful woman in the world!

213
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,410
Halt, man!

214
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,360
These girls are terrifying!

215
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,800
Nami's much better by far!

216
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,030
Or not...!

217
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,100
One direct hit from these
arrows and I'm a goner!

218
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,000
Alright!

219
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,680
Is that man a gibbon?!

220
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,290
Damn! We lost him!

221
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,010
We cannot have a living man
in this land whatsoever!

222
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,370
We have to find him and kill him
as quickly as possible!

223
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,100
Let's split up and search!

224
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,460
All right! Find him and
kill him, without fail!

225
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,640
Understood!

226
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,580
Is it a good idea to be here?

227
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,760
This is where I ran from earlier...

228
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,450
No other choice!

229
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,630
This is no time for that!

230
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,530
There he is!

231
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,780
Uh oh!

232
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,020
I won't miss this time!

233
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,320
Did you get him?!

234
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,830
Not yet! He fell into the jungle!

235
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,260
"Amazon Lily Empress,
Captain of the Kuja Pirates Warlord of the Sea –
‘Empress’ Boa Hancock"

236
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,920
So you've finally come for me...

237
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,520
What meddlesome people.

238
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,610
"Youngest of the Gorgon Sisters –
Boa Marigold"

239
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,390
My recent replies were lies.

240
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,180
"Second of the Gorgon Sisters –
Boa Sandersonia"

241
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,320
I will not go to war!

242
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,580
But...

243
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,690
I want you to let me keep
my title of Warlord of the Sea.

244
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,450
And...

245
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,160
I also want all of
the cargo on your ship.

246
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,240
What nonsense is this?!

247
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,380
You're not a selfish little child!

248
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,400
Do you honestly think we'll accept
such outrageous demands?!

249
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,770
Hurry and haul it over!

250
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,540
What a beautiful woman!

251
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,110
I'll give her anything!

252
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,130
Why are you hauling our cargo?!

253
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,210
Come to your senses!

254
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,900
Oh no! I blindly listened to what she said!

255
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,190
Portgas D. Ace's public execution
is in exactly one week from today!

256
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,710
Fire Fist Ace's life will be ended
in the town square of Marineford,

257
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,040
where Navy Headquarters stands!

258
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,290
In other words, Whitebeard will
make a move within the next week

259
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,670
to rescue Ace!

260
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,850
Navy Headquarters, led by three admirals,

261
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,210
is prepared to counter Whitebeard
with full military force!

262
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,340
Will you lose the title of Warlord,
or accept the orders to assemble?!

263
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,130
Decide now!

264
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,100
Time is nearly up!

265
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,840
I like the title of Warlord.

266
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,960
I don't want it taken away.

267
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,350
But I hate the World Government.

268
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,860
I don't want to obey its orders.

269
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,250
How does this sound?

270
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,870
The marines who came to get me

271
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,440
had a mysterious accident on the sea

272
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,500
and were wiped out when
they all turned to stone?

273
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,630
She's planning to do something!

274
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,640
Don't let your guard down!

275
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,250
I've heard about this before!

276
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,530
A ship was attacked by the Kuja pirate ship,

277
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,860
and when it was discovered later,

278
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,460
only strange statues were found onboard!

279
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,110
H-Hey! Look at that!

280
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,460
Wh-What are those?!

281
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,780
S-Strange statues?!

282
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,070
I already told you!

283
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,660
Your childish selfishness
will not be allowed!

284
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,280
Big Sis has a terrible personality.

285
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,260
But she gets everything she wants.

286
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,930
Yes. There is a reason for that.

287
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,460
Do you know why that is?

288
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,060
Because no matter what I do...

289
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,730
...even if I kick a kitten...

290
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,140
...even if I pull your ears off...

291
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,410
...or even if I kill someone,

292
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,780
everyone in the world would forgive me.

293
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,020
The reason for that is, yes...

294
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,360
...because I'm beautiful!

295
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,060
Because I'm beautiful!

296
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,050
Because I'm beautiful!

297
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,860
Snake Princess!

298
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,470
We'll let you do anything!

299
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,530
After all, you're beautiful!

300
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,760
Stop that, all of you!

301
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,940
For being charmed by me,
your guilty consciences...

302
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,400
...will turn your bodies solid!

303
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,600
Love-Love Beam!

304
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,780
Hanco--!

305
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,580
I'd expect no less from
a navy vice-admiral...

306
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,710
I see.

307
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,910
You used pain to block out the evil thoughts.

308
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,740
You've much experience, indeed.

309
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,130
However...

310
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,350
I wish I could say the same about your men.

311
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,600
Fools...!

312
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,780
It looks like you're the only one left now.

313
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,740
One and zero are not the same!

314
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,020
We will now return to the
peaceful Amazon Lily!

315
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,460
Yes, Snake Princess!

316
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,760
Boa Hancock!

317
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,040
I will wait here as long as I can!

318
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,450
I will not return empty-handed!

319
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,440
If you do not reappear in two days' time...

320
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,120
...the agreement is off!

321
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,090
Do as you wish.

322
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,080
Hoping to borrow a ship,

323
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,500
Luffy makes his way into the Kuja Castle,

324
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,560
but in his rush, he bursts in on
Hancock as she's taking a bath.

325
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,810
As he sees Hancock's form through the steam,

326
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,980
something on her back catches Luffy's eye...
