00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,740
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,130
...head for the New World,

4
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,690
the second half of the Grand Line.

5
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

6
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

7
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,460
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

8
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,240
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

9
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,960
a boy whose body turned to rubber

10
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,680
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

11
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,880
and his friends venture into that sea.

12
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,620
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

13
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,730
After surviving a fierce battle,

14
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,510
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

15
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,910
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

16
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,280
They landed on Punk Hazard;

17
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,860
an island with two parts,
one burning, the other frozen

18
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,740
and were held captive,
by Caesar Clown who rules the island

19
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,280
and were exposed to Shinokuni,
a weapon of mass destruction.

20
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,830
But they broke out thanks to their ally

21
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,100
a Warlord - Trafalgar Law's
tactful maneuvers

22
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,500
and now they are heading
for R Building - gate 66.

23
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,760
However, Caesar has let
Shinokuni flow into the laboratory.

24
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,180
You've got to be kidding!

25
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,930
Run! Run!

26
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,600
What're you doing?!

27
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,210
Hurry up!

28
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,520
Get me down!

29
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,850
Tashigi-chan!

30
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,060
That's enough!

31
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,110
You have to survive!

32
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,700
Goodbye!

33
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,700
Smoker-san told me...

34
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,080
...to help them!

35
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,300
--No, Captain-chan, it's too late!
--There's... There's no time!

36
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,830
Don't be ridiculous!

37
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,730
Your colleagues are still
outside of the gate!

38
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,800
Outta my way!

39
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,030
No means no!

40
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,260
Captain Tashigi!

41
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,640
Well done, guys!

42
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,680
We certainly got our beloved
Captain-chan in our hands!

43
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,300
"The Treacherous Vice Admiral!
Demon Bamboo Vergo!"

44
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,080
THE PASSAGE BETWEEN BUILDING A AND B

45
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,270
I can't believe he broke
the wall of the lab

46
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,840
and let the gas in.

47
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,340
That Caesar guy does
such bizarre things.

48
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,770
We got away for now

49
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,390
but it's not safe yet.

50
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,650
You're right.

51
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,840
We have to find the children

52
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,180
and head to R Building--gate 66 in hurry!

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,180
And then from this annoying lab,

54
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,640
we can escape.

55
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,440
Hey, go faster!

56
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,990
You people!

57
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,740
When did all of you get on?!

58
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,740
Now it's too heavy even for me.

59
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,510
I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,790
But you have to hang on.

61
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,460
We have no choice.

62
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,370
What?

63
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,580
Is there a compelling reason?

64
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,380
Yeah, we are...

65
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,300
...too tired and we don't want to run!

66
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,110
That's the worst reason!

67
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,570
Get off of me!

68
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,170
Your name...

69
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,890
is Brownbeard, isn't it?

70
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,210
I'm sorry

71
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,520
but I want to rescue
my son Momonosuke

72
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
as soon as possible!

73
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,650
R-Rescue your son?!

74
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,270
However,

75
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,920
since I ran a lot already

76
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,990
I just don't want to run anymore!

77
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,240
Get off, you fools!

78
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,990
I'm pretty hot with my coat on.

79
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,960
You can hang it here.

80
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,380
Great.

81
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm gonna take mine off, too.

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,010
Don't get comfortable on my back!

83
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,920
If you're not hurt,
why don't you run yourselves?!

84
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,430
I'm hungry.

85
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,300
I'm a samurai -
I don't get hungry.

86
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,980
Brownbeard-san,

87
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,780
do you have anything I can eat?

88
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,650
Shut up!

89
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,330
When we get to a soldiers' post,

90
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,990
I will buck you all off!

91
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,320
THE PASSAGE BETWEEN BUILDING A AND B

92
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,840
Captain-chan!

93
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,090
Captain-chan, are you listening?

94
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,420
Let's go ahead!

95
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,830
So he was making such a
deadly weapon on Punk Hazard

96
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,060
while the island was
believed to be closed.

97
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,350
If nothing is done, the damage
will spread around the world!

98
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,350
Let's get out of here

99
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,600
and make a report to Navy HQ!

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,560
What's the matter, Captain-chan?!

101
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,380
If we can't escape from here alive,

102
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,320
what did those guys who
saved your life died for?!

103
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,650
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,750
Let's go!

105
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,380
Yeah!

106
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,330
Wait a minute!

107
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,250
What's that noise?

108
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,470
There is something on the ceiling!

109
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,040
What is that creature?!

110
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,650
I think that thing came here
along with the Straw Hats!

111
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,740
Is it a lizard or something?

112
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,540
I heard that there was a
dragon on Punk Hazard!

113
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,850
It's a mythical animal

114
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,590
that Dr. Vegapunk created
for the security of the island.

115
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,110
It didn't look so scary before.

116
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,020
It's coming!

117
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,570
He dodged them!

118
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,610
H-He's chewing on steel!

119
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,540
If you get bitten by such strong jaws...

120
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,420
Everybody!

121
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,700
Run to B Building!

122
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,060
He flies, breathes fire,
and chews up steel!

123
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,980
What a creature!

124
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,410
What happened?

125
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,610
He's flying away.

126
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,640
Is he trying to escape?

127
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,850
He looked upset.

128
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,360
Did he get intimidated
by Captain Tashigi?

129
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,130
He was very scared.

130
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,320
Captain Tashigi,
you're gonna love this!

131
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,030
Reinforcements have arrived!

132
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,620
The Vice Admiral came to help!

133
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,080
Vergo!

134
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,320
Vice Admiral Smo-yan

135
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,780
and Vice Admiral Vergo!

136
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,140
We have both key figures of the G-5 here!

137
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,690
We're invincible now!

138
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,270
No...

139
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,260
Yeah! Now we're safe!

140
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,710
Run, everybody...

141
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,700
Run!

142
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,170
V-Vice Admiral Vergo,

143
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,090
did they do something wrong?!

144
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,760
Even if they needed to be punished,

145
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,450
your Finger Pistol could kill them...

146
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,660
Welcome.

147
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,020
I've heard about you,

148
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,010
Commodore Smoker.

149
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,900
Nice to meet you.

150
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,650
The soldiers of the G-5 are
rough and not very smart

151
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,810
but once you get to know them,

152
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,360
they're not as bad as people say.

153
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,200
Soon, you'll see
that they're very loyal.

154
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,420
Where is Vice Admiral Vergo?

155
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,080
He's not here.

156
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,400
Where did he go?

157
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,960
Don't worry.

158
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,930
Vice Admiral Vergo has to go home
suddenly sometimes.

159
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,760
His younger sister's sick.

160
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,800
Vice Admiral!

161
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,810
Stop it!

162
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,240
That's not what
Navy soldiers would say!

163
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,080
I don't think your house collapsed
because of our bombardment...

164
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,540
What do you mean by that?!

165
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,250
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,210
I'm responsible for their actions.

167
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,800
Oh yeah?

168
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,760
Then I want you
to take full responsibility!

169
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,000
You...

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,630
Don't get carried away!

171
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,890
I understand.

172
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,240
We will do anything

173
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,900
to make you satisfied.

174
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,140
Vice Admiral Vergo.

175
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,110
Vice Admiral Vergo.

176
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,950
About the report on the kidnapped
child from the other day...

177
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,350
Oh...

178
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,990
I told some soldiers to look into it

179
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,520
but it was an accident at sea,
as I suspected.

180
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,910
So it was a false report.

181
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,210
A false report?

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,460
It's hard for any parent to
accept his or her child's death.

183
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,870
So they try to keep thinking

184
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,080
that their child was kidnapped
to keep their hope alive.

185
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,780
You will see

186
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,060
when you become
a mother someday.

187
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,020
Is that how it is?

188
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,080
Yes, that's how it is.

189
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,430
Everybody, back away!

190
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,860
He is not the man
that you used to know!

191
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,580
For a long time, he has been...

192
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,330
Captain-chan!

193
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,920
Captain-chan!

194
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,410
He's an impostor!

195
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,380
Vergo-san wouldn't do such
a thing to Captain-chan!

196
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,910
He's right!

197
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,680
Are you in disguise
or a Devil Fruit eater?

198
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,850
Stop mocking Vice Admiral Vergo!

199
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,520
Vice Admiral Vergo...

200
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,520
...always defends us
misfit Navy soldiers!

201
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,090
He's a man of humanity and justice!

202
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,400
Stop mocking him!

203
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,200
I'll kick your ass,
you impostor!

204
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,700
Go to hell!

205
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,500
You're unforgivable,
you impostor!

206
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,370
I've lost my voice!

207
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,870
Please stop!

208
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,740
Help us, Smoker-san!

209
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,110
A lady is...

210
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,060
Who is it?!

211
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,340
...in need!

212
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,080
Is that...

213
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,090
O-One of the Straw Hats?

214
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,420
Why is a pirate helping us?

215
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,970
I heard the sound of...

216
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,970
...a woman's tears falling.

217
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,190
INSIDE OF B BUILDING

218
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,640
Sanji has taken off somewhere
making a serious face!

219
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,410
I felt a mysterious presence back there.

220
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,530
Forget about him.

221
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,330
Something is coming!

222
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,330
Is that...

223
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,710
That's the dragon-san from earlier!

224
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,340
He looks a little different.

225
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,720
Different? How?

226
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,470
The look in his eyes.

227
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,070
The sedatives have
worn off as I thought.

228
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,060
Sedatives?

229
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,110
Yeah, he's violent by nature.

230
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,530
It's hard to handle him
without sedatives.

231
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,990
Plus, he's one of the smaller ones
that are newer and more advanced.

232
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,660
They're faster and
much more resilient!

233
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,080
Let's just run for now!

234
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,340
Run faster!

235
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,010
A STAIRCASE IN THE MIDDLE OF B BUILDING

236
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,600
Damn!

237
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,890
I don't wanna fall behind!

238
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,900
Straw Hat,

239
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,150
where are you heading?

240
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,620
I'm gonna catch Caesar!

241
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,360
What about you?!

242
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm gonna sort things out with Vergo.

243
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,150
Is he with Caesar?

244
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,520
I think so.

245
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,570
Don't get in my way!

246
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,870
Wait, you bastard!

247
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,800
B BUILDING - THE GAS BALLOON LANDING PAD

248
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,460
Help!

249
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,430
I'm scared!

250
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,720
Get me out of here!

251
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,910
Help me!

252
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,920
Hey, stay away from the door.

253
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,350
Let's go back with everybody!

254
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,510
You can have a sweet candy
with your friends.

255
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,520
So let's go back to the Biscuit Room!

256
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,900
Brothers!

257
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,330
Sisters!

258
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,700
Help me!

259
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,450
In any case, I have to
get out of here first

260
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,160
to go rescue the children!

261
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,870
Let me out!

262
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,420
Oh?

263
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,710
What is a child doing here?

264
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,780
Let me out!

265
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,130
Be quiet!

266
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,840
If you don't stop,
I'll shoot you!

267
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,790
Weight Boost!

268
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,430
Stop it!

269
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,890
Who is it?!

270
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,110
I'll shoot you!

271
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,810
Don't move!

272
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,020
Are you okay?!

273
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,120
A monster!

274
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,620
Help!

275
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,590
It must be withdrawal symptoms.

276
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,330
Calm down!

277
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,460
No!

278
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,560
Oh yeah!

279
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,850
The sedatives!

280
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,840
This will ease your pain.

281
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,220
I'm gonna help you now.

282
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,550
Help!

283
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,700
Good girl!

284
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,510
It's done!

285
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,180
It's gonna work soon.

286
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,990
What was I doing?

287
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,730
You were pounding on the door.

288
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,170
Oh yeah,

289
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,660
I was trying to get out of here.

290
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,020
Hey, we took you out of here earlier -

291
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,870
why are you back here?

292
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,240
We came back here in
the Flying Gas Balloon

293
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,330
that the Master picked us up with.

294
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,250
But...

295
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,890
…big brother and sister
told us not to go back.

296
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,300
Of course!

297
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,640
What about the other kids?

298
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,780
Everybody's going to the Biscuit Room

299
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,350
because they have the candies there.

300
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,490
What?!

301
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,440
No!

302
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,110
You shouldn't eat the candy!

303
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,920
What?

304
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,280
This is bad!

305
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,980
Hey, could you take me
to the Biscuit Room?!

306
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,980
Okay! I know a shortcut
to the Biscuit Room!

307
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,030
Follow me!

308
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,130
CAESAR'S LABORATORY

309
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,460
What the hell is Vergo doing?!

310
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,140
The G-5 are my test subjects!

311
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,350
It'll be a total waste if I don't kill
them with Shinokuni!

312
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,260
That fool!

313
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,520
I have no choice.

314
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,860
Block off the passage ahead of them

315
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,630
and let the gas flow in
from the gate behind them!

316
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,070
But Vergo is still there.

317
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,120
I don't care if that idiot lives or dies!

318
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,610
Just do it!

319
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,080
B BUILDING 3RD FLOOR - NEAR THE BISCUIT ROOM

320
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,340
The Biscuit Room is down this way!

321
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,460
Let's go!

322
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,300
The Biscuit Room is this way!

323
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Can I have the candy?!

324
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,140
Oh no! Those are the children?!

325
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,400
We can't let them go beyond this door!

326
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,890
Mocha!

327
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,600
If you wanna save your friends,

328
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,780
you have to help me!

329
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,570
Okay!

330
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,940
Mocha, hold the door!

331
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,440
What are you doing, Mocha?!

332
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,450
Open up!

333
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,740
I wanna go to the Biscuit Room!

334
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,840
Listen!

335
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,730
Don't let them get to the Biscuit Room!

336
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,540
Uh-huh!

337
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,280
Open it!

338
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,750
Hey!

339
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,900
Why shouldn't we...

340
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,590
...eat the candy?

341
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,050
Because...

342
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,620
Ready?

343
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,170
No!

344
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,440
Wait a second!

345
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,510
You...

346
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,490
I've been running so fast that
the friction has burned the floor!

347
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,720
But that was...

348
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,920
...not fair!

349
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,500
You were gliding on smoke!

350
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,180
Okay, ready?

351
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,270
Wait!

352
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,610
I told you to wait!

353
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,630
I'll say "Okay" when I'm ready!

354
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,050
I'm catching my breath now.

355
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,590
Hey, I didn't say "Okay"!

356
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,810
Listen,

357
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,410
Vergo is my enemy!

358
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,550
I know!

359
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,420
My enemy is Caesar!

360
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,060
Keep your hands off of him!

361
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,150
Oh, it's my enemy!

362
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,200
I won't let you get away this time!

363
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,920
Caesar!

364
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,130
The showdown with Caesar begins!

365
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,090
As Caesar uses his Gas Gas Fruit abilities that previously defeated the Straw Hats...

366
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,600
...Luffy launches a mighty offensive of his own!

367
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,060
The battle...

368
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,270
...grows more intense than ever!

369
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

370
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,110
"A Fierce Battle Gets Heated!
Luffy vs. Caesar!"

371
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
