2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,560
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,730
Luffy made a raid on the Navy HQ to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,240
But his struggle ended in vain

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,290
and the historic War of the
Best in Marineford has ended.

63
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,810
"Landing at the Maiden Island! The
Harsh Reality Falls upon Luffy!"

64
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,140
WEST BLUE

65
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,370
A pirate ship is approaching
Lascamp, West Blue!

66
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,960
But bases in that area have no ships!

67
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,260
The nearest bases outside of that area are...

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,640
The 80th division will send back-up!

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,180
This is South Blue checking
the location of the site!

70
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,190
Dammit!

71
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,500
I thought pirates would be

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,780
afraid of us after killing
Whitebeard and gaining victory!

73
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,130
Instead of laying low, they
are going wild everywhere!

74
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,300
What's gotten into them?

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,910
Pirates have made a raid on Lascamp!

76
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,690
We lost touch with the site! Send back-up!

77
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,000
I repeat, send back-up to Lascamp!

78
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,850
Load supplies! Let's head for the Grand Line!

79
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,130
Two weeks after the War of the Best,

80
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,020
people start to seeing
effects around the world.

81
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,150
Y-You can't come any further!
Don't come into our town!

82
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,530
You heard the news, didn't you?

83
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,880
Then you know that this island is
no longer Whitebeard's territory.

84
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,960
This symbol is meaningless now!

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,800
That's right! Whitebeard is dead!

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,690
Listen, and engrave this in your mind!

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,010
The man who takes control of
this island from today is me -

88
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,530
the pirate Brownbeard!

89
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,290
The war ended with the death of
Whitebeard and the victory of the Navy.

90
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,020
But contrary to what the Navy thought,

91
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,130
the situation has grown
tense all over the world.

92
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,390
Meanwhile, a short time ago,

93
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,150
Hancock, Jimbei and others decided

94
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,270
to head to the Maiden Island
to harbor the unconscious Luffy

95
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,980
and joined up with the Kuja's ship.

96
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,690
--Big Sis!
--Big Sis!

97
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,190
Snake Princess-sama!

98
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,110
Sorry that I made you worry,
Sandersonia, Marigold, and everyone!

99
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,910
Thank you for your warm greeting!

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,580
We are all so grateful for
your great work as a Warlord!

101
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,630
Alright then, this is it for my
role in supporting Straw boy.

102
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,630
Heehaw!

103
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,930
Do you mind if I leave the
rest up to you, Jimbei?

104
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,220
Yes. I can't swim as I want yet.

105
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,060
The least I can do is stay
here until he gets well.

106
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,370
I don't know how I can help him, though.

107
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,320
It was a curious turn of fate to meet you.

108
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,850
I agree.

109
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,020
Although we were both locked up in

110
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,700
the greatest prison in the world - Impel Down,

111
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,660
if it weren't for Luffy-kun,

112
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,250
we would have never met each
other at all I suppose.

113
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:11,050
We both tried really hard to keep up
with Straw boy at Marineford, didn't we?

114
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,720
It's hard to say goodbye to you

115
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,550
but I have sweet candies waiting
for me to come back to the kingdom.

116
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,480
Please take good care of Straw boy!

117
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,440
Bye, Straw Hat! Thank you for letting us out!

118
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,280
My dream can come true because of you!

119
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,950
Say "hi" to him when he wakes up!

120
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,120
--See you again if we have a chance!
--Hang in there!

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,080
You can't die, Straw Hat!

122
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,880
Okay, let's go!

123
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,380
To the New Kamas' home and our mecca!

124
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,380
To the Kamabakka Kingdom! Heehaw...

125
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,220
We have to head for the Maiden Island, too.

126
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,060
And the pirate ship that Luffy is on arrived
at the Maiden Island - Amazon Lily,

127
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,590
the female-only empire
where men are prohibited

128
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,130
and Kuja, the tribe of
female fighters, lives.

129
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,610
--Snake Princess-sama!
--Welcome back!

130
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,910
I'm so glad that the princess is safe!

131
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,870
There are men on the
strange ship in the back!

132
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,750
--Look! There are only women!
--It's true that it's a female-only island!

133
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,470
--They snuck into the ship! Unforgivable!
--W-Wait!

134
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,600
--Smells nice!
--I feel lightheaded!

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,520
This must be heaven!

136
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,100
Hey, you guys.

137
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,560
You gotta go back in, otherwise you'll die.

138
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,660
People, stop! They're not our enemy!

139
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Snake Princess-sama!

140
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,180
Luffy is in that ship!

141
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,500
He suffered greatly, mentally and
physically, during the battle at Marineford

142
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,830
and he is hanging between life and death now.

143
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,540
Luffy's here?!

144
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,920
Ladies, carry Luffy to the Kuja
Castle as soon as possible!

145
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,100
--I'm gonna look after Luffy...
--Wait a minute, Snake Princess!

146
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,470
Granny Nyon!

147
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,560
It's fine if it's just Luffy.

148
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,230
But we can't allow those
men on that strange ship

149
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,320
to step foot onto the Maiden Island.

150
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,900
It's against our country's policy!

151
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,950
Then, let's just allow the
doctor to come with him so...

152
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,190
No!

153
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,650
We can't allow any men to come onto
the island, even if he is a doctor!

154
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,790
We have so many good doctors on this island!

155
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,170
Well, I don't care either way but...

156
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,720
...do you have the same medical
equipment and technology as my ship?

157
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,390
If his wound opens up, he's going to die.

158
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,810
Take Straw Hat-ya if you don't care about it.

159
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,790
Luffy's gonna die?!

160
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,360
If that happens by any chance...
Oh, I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

161
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,490
It's obvious that we can't save
Luffy-kun without this man.

162
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,580
If he can't come in, we have no choice.

163
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,340
We must go somewhere else.

164
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,410
Impossible! We'd be
attacked by the Sea Kings!

165
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,370
Even if we get away from them, the
Navy could find us at anytime!

166
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,380
What should we do?!

167
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,460
Oh, well... We only do
it as an exception but...

168
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,430
...you can stay in the area of the bay.

169
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,390
The Sea Kings won't attack you there.

170
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,100
Then, I'll stay with them
to look after Luffy...

171
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,520
No!

172
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,320
Damn Granny Nyon! You just
keep saying "no" to me!

173
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,690
Luffy! I hope you'll get better soon!

174
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,540
Looking at Snake Princess-sama,

175
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,410
I can tell that Luffy is
in critical condition.

176
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,330
Luffy...

177
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,330
Two weeks have passed.

178
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,290
Law and others are staying in the bay...

179
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,170
...to provide Luffy with treatment.

180
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,590
How much longer do we have to
stay in such a small space...

181
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,050
Yeah, the only thing to look forward to is...

182
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,430
--Guys, sorry to keep you waiting!
--It's a meal time.

183
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,140
Finally!

184
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,350
Here it is.

185
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,230
--The only consolation is that the food is good!
--I agree!

186
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,780
--Here you go!
--Thank you...

187
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,200
Please don't push and wait for your turn.

188
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,160
Aphelandra!

189
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,750
Don't talk to men!

190
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,370
Luffy is the exception because
of the princess' orders.

191
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,000
Don't forget!

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,420
Okay!

193
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,610
Come on, it's no big deal!
Right, Aphelandra-chan?

194
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm not gonna say it again!

195
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,350
We're sorry!

196
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,560
Excuse me.

197
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,230
Is Luffy awake?

198
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,940
I see.

199
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,940
It's up to Straw Hat-ya's spirit.

200
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,320
Whether he's willing to live or not.

201
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,580
--Margaret, let's go already!
--I'm coming!

202
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,910
I'm sorry! Take good care of Luffy!

203
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,830
Margaret, how many times do I have
to tell you not to talk to them?!

204
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm sorry!

205
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,680
Big Sis...

206
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,610
Luffy...

207
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,080
You've always been like this, Luffy!

208
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,910
You've never even listened to me...

209
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,420
...and always done such crazy things!

210
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,160
Don't do it...

211
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
Don't do it!

212
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,500
--Stop it, Straw Hat!
--You wanna destroy the ship?!

213
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,030
Ace...

214
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,260
Luffy-kun!

215
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,220
Ace...

216
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
Ace...

217
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,020
Where's Ace?!

218
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,160
This is dangerous! Calm down, Straw Hat!

219
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,470
What is going to happen
if we leave him like that?

220
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,260
Well, it's simple. Like
I said when we got here,

221
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,090
if his wound opens up, he will die.

222
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,920
Yes, now is the chance!

223
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,030
--Let me go, dammit!
--Stay still, Straw Hat!

224
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,490
--Shut up! I'm looking for Ace!
--I told you that "Fire Fist" is...

225
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,830
I said "let me go"!

226
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,750
Where's Ace?!

227
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,460
--Ace!!
--Damn! He's out of control!

228
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,090
--It's Luffy!
--We got to tell Snake Princess-sama!

229
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,760
Snake Princess-sama! Snake Princess-sama!

230
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,140
Luffy woke up!

231
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,850
--Luffy-sama?!
--Really?!

232
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,730
I'm glad. I wanna see him right away!

233
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,560
You can't, Snake Princess!

234
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,520
Everybody wants to see him.

235
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,740
You can't discipline your people if
you allow yourself to go and see him.

236
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,110
Men are prohibited on this island.

237
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,720
We let strange men stay at the bay area

238
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,250
and that's enough of an exception for us!

239
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,220
I know, but...

240
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,890
Before that, Big Sis, you
need to eat something.

241
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,880
That's right, Big Sis! You've
barely eaten since you got back!

242
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,380
That's right! Luffy must be very hungry, too!

243
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,640
Fix a lot of great dishes
that will give him energy!

244
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,390
Yes, we'd be happy to!

245
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,810
I'm gonna help you! Ladies, let's do it now!

246
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,900
Yes, Snake Princess-sama!

247
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,730
I should just let her do that. She
just wants to fix some food...

248
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,860
Then I'm gonna take them to him!

249
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,410
So you're going?!

250
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,330
We promised that when he gets
well, we would invite Luffy alone.

251
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,080
Wait for that moment!

252
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,710
I can't! I am an empress!
Don't tell me what to do!

253
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,870
I said no!

254
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,090
The most important thing is
the hereditary policy of this country!

255
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,430
Honestly! You're infected
by such a strong virus!

256
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,470
I can't believe that the fearful
pirate empress has become love sick!

257
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,560
However, he must have been like a small ant

258
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,150
diving into a tempest at
Impel Down and the Navy HQ.

259
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,990
It must have been an act of God to let
him live and be brought back here.

260
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,160
I wonder what God expects from him.

261
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,910
--Hey, pass me the wrench.
--Okay, here you go.

262
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,960
Hey, do you think you can fix the ship?

263
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,210
Yeah, I'll manage.  That aside,
where did Straw Hat go?

264
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,150
Jimbei is gone, too.

265
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,120
I don't know.

266
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,670
Well, I heard that if a man enters the

267
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,090
Maiden Island, he's gonna be turned to stone

268
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,220
but maybe it's worth dying for.

269
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,520
According to Aphelandra-chan, not
all women were there at the port.

270
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,530
The female-only island that I dreamed
of! I wish I could take a look inside!

271
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,650
You're gonna die, you idiot.

272
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,740
I wonder if there are female bears...

273
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,540
It's Maiden Island!

274
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,610
Only humans! There are only humans!

276
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,640
I'm really sorry!

277
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,210
Where am I?

278
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,010
Maybe it was all a dream...

279
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,860
I'm sorry, Luffy...

280
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,840
I couldn't make it all the way.

281
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,250
Go away! Go away!

282
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,630
Luffy!

283
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,590
No!

284
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,700
Go away! Go away!

285
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,440
If I don't escape death...

286
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,230
I'm sorry but could you
look after my brother?

287
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,310
The war is over!

288
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,820
Ace-san is...

289
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,160
Don't say it! Don't say anything!

290
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,360
I already pinched myself
hard enough to rip my skin!

291
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,170
If it were a dream, I should've woken by now!

292
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,050
It's not a dream, is it?

293
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,980
Ace is really dead, isn't he?!

294
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,590
Yes, he is dead!

295
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,020
Hey grandpa, who is Ace?

296
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,630
Oh, he is...

297
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,380
...the guy who will become your brother!

298
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,220
Luffy! I'll see you at the
top of the pirates' world!

299
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,870
Come to the top!

300
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,920
Ace!!

301
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,840
Next week is a special
collaboration with Toriko!

302
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,590
Those Barbecue Pigs are scary!

303
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,520
Whew, I'm stuffed! That was tasty!

304
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,820
Apparently there are lots
more of these things!

305
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,680
Really?!

306
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,170
That's what Toriko said! I wanna go home!

307
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,100
Okay! We're going with Toriko!

308
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,310
What?!

309
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,850
Next week, the special Toriko x
One Piece collaboration episode!

310
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,750
"The Strongest Tag-Team! Luffy
and Toriko's Hard Struggle!"

311
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,220
Don't miss it!
